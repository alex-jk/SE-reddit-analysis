She is a mess, but we’ll take it one step at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe left a day earlier because his weekend shift got cancelled and she realized he will likely “celebrate” that extra free day with a drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour comments and stories helped a lot. After discussing them over the phone, she realized that she cannot afford to spend one more weekend with him, because it will very likely become her last weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not tell him anything and didn’t leave the letter. She, unfortunately, decided to take his call, and he went from “love of my life, where are you, I am worried sick” to a “you dirty bitch, you used me” real quick. She blocked him after the call. I do not think he can track her - he isn’t exactly technical, their phones have different operating systems, and she disabled l location services. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you all very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nORIGINAL POST\\r\\n\\r\\nDisclaimer: I am writing about a situation of my relative because her reddit is being actively monitored by her abuser. I will be able to call her to share comments. \\r\\n\\r\\nI do not know all the details and their history of the abuse, I only know that “it was not that bad before” and that it has rapidly escalated about a month ago - that’s when she reached out to me for help. He hit and strangled her several times, there are photos of bruises on her neck and recordings of conversation that lead to one of the attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is ready to leave this weekend while he is at work. She has most basics packed, some cash stashed, and a temporary housing arranged in a different city. She, however, feels uneasy about leaving unannounced. She wants to somehow let him know that she left. She is convinced that it isn’t a big deal because the abuser is only physically violent when he is drunk. She says she only expects him to be verbally aggressive.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it is a bad idea because what if her farewell causes things to escalate even more? He is a very strong man and she is a physically sick weak woman. There is absolutely no way she can fight back if he attacks her again. I believe she is not dead only because he let her live.\\r\\n\\r\\nI need some tips/advice please.', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jajams/abused_wants_to_tell_the_abuser_that_shes_leaving/')\n",

      "but my father has relapsed and I don’t know what to do.\n",
      "Any advice?\n",
      "Here’s the back story:\n",
      "My dad has been an alcoholic since I could remember.\n",
      "He was very abusive to my mom and I could never understand why.\n",
      "He would always go on these drunk rampages about stupid things like not locking the door or us dropping something on accident.\n",
      "I’ve learned to not slam things or stomp my feet purely to make sure I couldn’t make him mad.\n",
      "I’ve now adopted this into my normal life that I get a mini panic attack if someone starts yelling or if I heard someone slam something.\n",
      "Two years ago I finally had enough and couldn’t take it anymore.\n",
      "I lived at home with my sick mom and my dad.\n",
      "He came home one night so drunk he blamed us for things I didn’t even understand - such as us talking bad about him with his brethren in his lodge, snooping through his things, and more.\n",
      "He use to be in the military and I’m 1000% sure he has undiagnosed PTSD and paranoia.\n",
      "I had had enough and told him to stop it and tell me what is wrong so I can help him.\n",
      "One thing lead to another and he threatened to kill us after trying to back me into a corner and hurt me.\n",
      "He’s never hit me ever until now.\n",
      "This wasn’t the first time he has threatened to kill us though\n",

      "He took out his gun and everything.\n",

      "I put a space heater and a few other things in front of my door just in case and told my mom to go to sleep.\n",
      "I didn’t sleep that night, I stayed up and waited till he got home.\n",
      "I researched everything I could for help.\n",
      "I made a plan to grab anything important and leave while he slept.\n",
      "He came home at 3am made sure we knew too by honking the horn to wake us and maybe even the neighbors up.\n",
      "Got in the house and slammed the door to his room shut.\n",
      "Shook the house.\n",
      "My mom and I got our things and left with the dog to a family friends house for help in the morning.\n",
      "We called the cops and he was put in jail for 24 hours.\n",

      "Judge gave it for 18 month requirement with monthly check in on alcohol.\n",
      "Since then my sister, brother in law, nephew, and mom went back home with him because purely he was so much better and wasn’t drinking.\n",
      "We were all happy!\n",
      "I ended up moving to Texas with my husband.\n",
      "Now it’s 2022, it’s happening again.\n",
      "We noticed earlier in the year that he was starting to pick up drinking again.\n",
      "He’d come home late but never buzzed or drunk.\n",
      "He didn’t know we knew at the time (we track his location).\n",
      "Lately he’s been coming home buzzed and or drunk.\n",
      "His anger is back to how it was prior to us leaving before.\n",
      "He almost hurt my nephew (2 years old) while yelling about who chipped his mug and throwing it in the direction of the baby.\n",
      "They live together so it’s a little harder this time to up and leave like before.\n",
      "I also live out of state\n",
      "so I can’t just fly up to help..\n",
