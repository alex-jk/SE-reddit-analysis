She is a mess, but we’ll take it one step at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe left a day earlier because his weekend shift got cancelled and she realized he will likely “celebrate” that extra free day with a drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour comments and stories helped a lot. After discussing them over the phone, she realized that she cannot afford to spend one more weekend with him, because it will very likely become her last weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not tell him anything and didn’t leave the letter. She, unfortunately, decided to take his call, and he went from “love of my life, where are you, I am worried sick” to a “you dirty bitch, you used me” real quick. She blocked him after the call. I do not think he can track her - he isn’t exactly technical, their phones have different operating systems, and she disabled l location services. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you all very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nORIGINAL POST\\r\\n\\r\\nDisclaimer: I am writing about a situation of my relative because her reddit is being actively monitored by her abuser. I will be able to call her to share comments. \\r\\n\\r\\nI do not know all the details and their history of the abuse, I only know that “it was not that bad before” and that it has rapidly escalated about a month ago - that’s when she reached out to me for help. He hit and strangled her several times, there are photos of bruises on her neck and recordings of conversation that lead to one of the attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is ready to leave this weekend while he is at work. She has most basics packed, some cash stashed, and a temporary housing arranged in a different city. She, however, feels uneasy about leaving unannounced. She wants to somehow let him know that she left. She is convinced that it isn’t a big deal because the abuser is only physically violent when he is drunk. She says she only expects him to be verbally aggressive.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it is a bad idea because what if her farewell causes things to escalate even more? He is a very strong man and she is a physically sick weak woman. There is absolutely no way she can fight back if he attacks her again. I believe she is not dead only because he let her live.\\r\\n\\r\\nI need some tips/advice please.', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jajams/abused_wants_to_tell_the_abuser_that_shes_leaving/')\n",
