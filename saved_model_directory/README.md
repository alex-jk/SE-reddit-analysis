# SetFit with sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

This is a [SetFit](https://github.com/huggingface/setfit) model that can be used for Text Classification. This SetFit model uses [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) as the Sentence Transformer embedding model. A [LogisticRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) instance is used for classification.

The model has been trained using an efficient few-shot learning technique that involves:

1. Fine-tuning a [Sentence Transformer](https://www.sbert.net) with contrastive learning.
2. Training a classification head with features from the fine-tuned Sentence Transformer.

```python
from setfit import SetFitModel

# Download from the ðŸ¤— Hub
model = SetFitModel.from_pretrained("setfit_model_id")
# Run inference
preds = model("I carried guilt for this and still believe I was at fault.")
```
