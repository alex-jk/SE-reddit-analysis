"Harassment,stalking,domestic violence???","My friends ex is CRAZY for her. He’s hacked all of her accounts. Got into her google and her Facebook. He has posted nasty things about her on fb making it look as if she posted it. He’s sent out a sec video of them to EVERYONE! Her father, brothers, even a random hairstylist in our small town. About a month ago her house burned down. He happened to drive by while it was happening.. not as if he was just in the neighborhood. He lives about 40 miles away from her. At this time I knew it was him that burned her house down. Idk why.. I just felt it. She hadn’t yet excepted the fact that he did this. Until, about a week later she stayed at a friends (being homeless now) that night she was afraid. So her and her friend left and went and stayed at her friends sisters two towns over instead. That night, her friends RV burns to the ground. Where they were supposed to be sleeping.. Again, police were called. Nothing was done. They took a report and nobody heard another word about it. Now she has her own place and got a new phone to try and keep him from tracking and finding her. Well he found her. He sent out more sec videos. He pulled up late about a week ago and went around the back of the house. Knocked a small hole in her bedroom window and threw a lit flare inside. Caught the wall and curtains on fire. She was at work but her room mate was there and heard a noise. Luckily he was able to put out the fire and then run outside to see her EX BOYFRIEND jumping in the driver seat of his ex wife’s vehicle and hauling ass away. Again, cops were called. They said there was nothing they could do. 
Now I need to mention that in between the fire events her ex also showed up at her mothers and loosened her dads lug nuts in the middle of the night. Tried to break into her son a rv on her mom’s property and the neighbor saw him. When the neighbor yelled her ex jumped on his motorcycle, hauled ass. A red car comes around the corner, hits a deer launching at her ex KNOCKING HIM OFF HIS BIKE and he ends up being rushed to the er with bad injuries. Cops were called again. Now they have more witnesses and more proof he’s doing these things. Unfortunately the cops said they can’t do much. Maybe a trespassing citation. But since nobody saw him loosen the lug nuts , there was nothing they can do. He has in the passed week snuck up
To her house and busted out her back windshield TWICE! In the last week! Costing her $299. Each time!! Cops called and still nothings been done. She has forwarded their messages to the police and tried everything. This is happening in south Texas. Why on gods earth are the police not doing anything? That wreck he was in, shouldn’t that have been feeing the seen of a crime since he was running from getting caught on her mom’s property? With witnesses!! What about the two fires and the flare? Is this not enough evidence! Shouldn’t that be assault with a deadly weapon? Arson? What in gods name is going on here??? Somebody shed some light because I’ve told her she needs to call the news station. It’s be that nobody’s going to help her . My fear is , how will this end? I’m afraid for her life!","Harassment,stalking,domestic violence??? My friends ex is CRAZY for her. He’s hacked all of her accounts. Got into her google and her Facebook.

DV centers won’t help for indirect violence,"I’ve been contacting local DV centers for months now, rotting on waitlists for intake calls, trying to get counseling to create an exit plan. The last one that finally called me told me I was ineligible because there was no direct physical abuse. They asked 1 vague screening question and I answered it wrong and they said we can’t help you. I protested that I was referred to them because my relationship was too abusive for another center. That center has said I need your wraparound services because of my disability. This center said, no we help women who are at serious risk of being murdered soon—if that’s not you, we can’t help you. I was so devastated I couldn’t say anything. 


I’m disabled and largely bedbound/housebound. My partner is too smart and has too much to loose to hit me. But as a caregiver and financial provider, they instead put me in situations of incredible risk and negligence.  I’ve had to be hospitalized with serious injuries because of it. More often it’s things like they’ll set me up to run completely out of medications that are dangerous for me to stop. I would argue that this is physical abuse even if they aren’t touching me, considering my vulnerable status. Just like APS can get involved when elders are being abused without being hit. 

The normal every day stuff is my partner uses money to control me and deny me access to medical care. They bully, belittle, harass, shame, and insult me. They don’t stop when I say stop in sex. They tell me about violent sexual fantasies of hurting me. And on and on. This is a very powerful, well known, vindictive person, and I am afraid to do anything to confront them directly. I have to get out quietly, without accusing them of anything.

It was really upsetting to tell someone all the ways I am at risk and have them tell me it’s not enough for me to deserve help.

Because of my disability and medical problems, I don’t have hotline level challenges for getting out. I don’t think I could even medically stay in a shelter. I’m not sure what to do","DV centers won’t help for indirect violence I’ve been contacting local DV centers for months now, rotting on waitlists for intake calls, trying to get counseling to create an exit plan.

"Big Banana, small banana","
It’s the last day of Strangulation Awareness month, and I’ve been trying to come up with some easy ways to convey the difference between “choking” and “strangulation” and encourage using the correct terminology. 

Choking refers to airway obstruction. Think “Big Banana”. 

Strangulation refers to pressure applied to the neck that blocks the flow of blood and oxygen. A highly gendered and highly lethal act of violence, often used by men against female intimate partners, manual strangulation is preferred by criminals who so desperately need to feel like they are in control that they will seek to manipulate and dominate anyone and anything in their lives, and using their hands to control whether you take another breath is worth the risk that you might die right then and there. 

Think “small banana”. 

A miserable, inadequate, and dangerous small banana who is 750% more likely to murder the partners they strangle. 

Using the correct terminology and knowing how dangerous strangulation is will save lives.

Family violence. My husband call the police but take him to jail.,"He smashed his cell phone and blamed on me for calling him while he is at a test. Week later, We had a conversation about his cell phone he smashed. He said I should use the public funds to repair it. I don’t agree because he smashed the phone himself. And I shouldn’t bear the cost. So he got angry and become violent. He closed the home camera and started hit me with his fist.  I tried to defense back. He said he is bleeding. ( I dont see him bleeding). He yelled at me and said he will call police and will send me to jail today. I don’t want to escalate things so I asked him do not call police. 

He asked me to kneel down and to beg him not to call police. I did… I beg him don’t call police. But he kept on threatening me. I cannot bear any more. So I said fine, do whatever you want. So he called th police. Police came and decided to take him away. 

He will have a court on Monday and asked him to bail him out. I don’t know what will happen next. What to do. Should I help him? #domestic ","Family violence.

Ex bf upset I didn't message him,"I didn't know how to title it. This was January 2023.

So I was staying with my ex bf after he was discharged from a mental health hospital end of 2022. When I was looking after him, my mother fell into a coma on New year's eve and was in the for nearly a month. I visited her nearly every day. When my mother did wake up from her coma and was stable, she was moved to a different ward where there was no signal. She needed help walking and bathing herself and didn't like the nurses. I was also my mother's carer.

He would constantly message me while I was with her, if I didn't reply quick enough he would threaten to kill himself and I would have to talk him down from it, call an ambulance. 

On Jan 17, he beat me. He was mad that it took me so long to cook and eat _(I had a long important phone call, he knew this)._ He didn't want to look at me, said that I wanted him to starve so I went to the living room and the door accidentally slammed shut. My hands was full with my food. By the time I put it down, he rushed into the room, screaming ""how dare I slam doors in his house"". He punched and kicked my head and back while I begged him to stop. Kicked my food everywhere, broke glass, punched his walls. I was only wearing a dressing gown and he pulled it off me, tried to strangle me with it and left me naked on the floor while he went around destroying his flat. His windows were wide open. I was terrified. Banging his head against the walls yelling that he's going to kill himself. When neighbours tried to knock he told them to fuck off then went to hit me again. Saying that this is my fault, look what I made him do and how I want to get him arrested like all his other exes. Multiple neighbours and passersby called the police.

 When they came, we told them he was having a mental health crisis and that he didn't hurt me. I couldn't go see my mother that day, it was too late. He went to the hospital and I stayed, cleaning up his mess. He was in the hospital overnight and most of the day. I stayed up until 12pm, I was just in shock about it all. My body was aching. My head hurt. Emotionally I was numb. I had a short nap and then rushed to see my mother in the new ward. I wasn't focusing on him. It was the best I felt in so long. Me and my mother were chatting, I helped her walk around her room, eat and bathed her. I just didn't want to leave her when it was time. He tried calling and texting me but there was no signal. 

While he was texting me, I was snappy with him. I was still upset about the day before. I didn't do what I normally do when I forget to text which is me sending a big paragraph explaining everything I did from the moment I woke up in detail, how I forgot to message because I was busy, apologising, telling him I love him and using pet names etc.

I called an ambulance and couldn't answer him because I was on the phone to them. He always gets upset with me when I call them. I gave the opperator his number and I waited on his road for an hour or so until they arrived because I was terrified of what he would do to me alone because I gave him attitude. I just couldn't stop crying. I didn't want to go in because I never know what side of him I'll see. Especially since he drank and probably was in another destructive, violent mood 

Anytime I feel like I miss him, I'm going to write about about the things he did to me. I need to remind myself what sort of person he is.","Ex bf upset I didn't message him I didn't know how to title it. This was January 2023.

My mom called my abuser a 'poor baby boy',"Almost two weeks ago, I fled my home after my bofriend of 7 years threatened to kill me. I took my dogs and left behind pretty much everything else I owned. I spent more than a week in hiding, afraid to go outside or even open the curtains. 

I have talked to my mom several times since I left, and almost every time, she's made me feel even worse. Yesterday she called me to check-in, and ended up calling my abuser a 'poor baby boy'. The man that had spent 7 years screaming that I was a worthless, stupid cunt. The man that spent 7 years insisting that I needed to meet his every emotional need, and I wasn't allowed to share my feelings. The man that detroyed my belongings, threw things at me, and then told me it was my fault because I hurt his feelings. The man that literally THREATENED TO KILL ME. 

He gets my house, my furniture, my cats, and most of the stuff in my home. I am currently staying in a bedroom so small that it doesn't fit anything besides the bed. I I'm losing most of what I owned, including my home and car. His family can probably afford a lawyer to fuck me out of all of the equity in our home. I have to start over completely, and somehow she still makes me feel bad, and makes him out to be the victim. 

While going through old messages, collecting documentation for an OFP, I found countless times she had convinced me to stay. I would message her saying 'I feel unsafe, but I'm afraid to leave' and her response was consistently 'what did you do wrong, you should apologize to him.' I might have left 6 months in, instead of 7 years later, if my mother hadn't been encouraging me to stay. 

I became estranged from my  father when I was 16, because he sexually assaulted me. Now, after sharing my feelings with my mom, she stopped talking to me. I feel like I might as well be an orphan. My abuser has his mom by his side to fix everything for him, and I am alone trying to pick up the pieces. 

I have amazing support from my friends, but goddamn, I just want my mommy, and she refuses to be there for me. ","My mom called my abuser a 'poor baby boy' Almost two weeks ago, I fled my home after my bofriend of 7 years threatened to kill me. I took my dogs and left behind pretty much everything else I owned. I spent more than a week in hiding, afraid to go outside or even open the curtains. 

I have talked to my mom several times since I left, and almost every time, she's made me feel even worse. Yesterday she called me to check-in, and ended up calling my abuser a 'poor baby boy'. The man that had spent 7 years screaming that I was a worthless, stupid cunt. The man that spent 7 years insisting that I needed to meet his every emotional need, and I wasn't allowed to share my feelings. The man that detroyed my belongings, threw things at me, and then told me it was my fault because I hurt his feelings. The man that literally THREATENED TO KILL ME. 

He gets my house, my furniture, my cats, and most of the stuff in my home. I am currently staying in a bedroom so small that it doesn't fit anything besides the bed.

Having trouble going to the police about my (EX) boyfriend strangling me,"My ex-boyfriend strangled me last Thursday. This is the first time (and last) he ever strangled me. We do have a pending court case for the last time he assaulted me. I am still in shock. 

I did not go to the police. I told him if he let me go home to my mother & father that I wouldn’t call.  

I do have a video and text message proof that this happened. 

I know I should definitely report this, but carrying the weight of being the reason why someone goes to prison is unnerving to me. On the other hand, I feel like I’ll be angry down the line in time because I didn’t do anything about it and let him get away with doing such a thing to me. Part of me feels like I’m over reacting because he only strangled me for less than 10 seconds. Is it worth it to ruin someone’s life for less than 10 seconds? 

I recognize that this is a trauma bond, and I will not be going back to him under any circumstances. I’m just giving reason as to why even care about his life still. 

Thanks in advance for not judging me

has anyone else been strangled?,"hi I was in a relationship where my ex strangled me repeatedly. it started with him putting me in chokeholds and by the end he was doing the typical both hands around my neck thing. would usually be accompanied by other physical violence (broke my nose, possible skull fracture cuz my ear was bleeding). 

anyway this was over a full year now, last time he strangled me was november or december 2023

if you've been strangled, do you get ptsd symptoms from it/have you been diagnosed with ptsd? I am not looking for a diagnosis, I'm already diagnosed with cptsd but can anyone empathize with these symptoms:
- I just smoked, I don't smoke often so I notice the way it constricts my airway in a way I didn't pay as much attention to before. feeling any pressure on my windpipe freaks me out.
- I have nightmares of being strangled. doesn't help that I gave sleep apnea so whenever I have an episode now it'll be accompanied by a strangulation dreams. like i physically can't breathe and it translates in the dream as seeing him above me strangling me. fortunately new daily inhaler has helped me breathe better in my sleep so this hasn't happened lately
- I guess sort of flashbacks? like I'll be driving and still aware of the road but reliving it in my minds eye
- I can't watch it in movies. even cartoons if a character gets choked out I start to feel it
- tried to hook up with someone and they put their hand near my neck and I immediately hit it away from me

How do I help my friend.,"Okay so my best friend cut all contact with me over 8 years ago after dating this guy for about a year or so, then she got back in touch last year, I was still hurting so I didn't talk to her much then in about October she started to tell me how bad it was and how abusive he was, emotional and physical violence, he tried to strangle her multiple times and she was on the high risk of death list with the police. I even heard him abusing her, I helped her and she told me she had somewhere safe to go once we get her out. She was sleeping with a door wedge and against the door incase he tried to get to her in the night. Anyway we got her out with the help of police and she looked ao emaciated and scared, she practically collapsed into my arms. So her safe place turned out to be her ex's house and it turns out she never told me how controlling and belittling he was and is now even worse, so we are currently working on getting her to stay at my place as soon as she has somewhere safe for her dog to stay (we are limited by space and also have disabled cats and bunnies). We have a protection order out so he can't contact her and he is going to be charged as she documented quite a bit of evidence and sent me everything. I'm also giving evidence about what I witnessed.

Anyway,
She still talks about how much she still loves her abuser and how there were good times too and she misses him, how it was a lot of his autism that maybe made him so sadistic. How people have told her he has turned his life around now and while he used to drink about 2 liters of vodka a night he has now quit drinking completely which I find hard to believe in such a short space of time. I feel like he is putting on a show for everyone so he can get her back. It's like she is brainwashed. I don't know how to help her. Can anyone please offer any tips or advice. She quite likes to look into/research and watch documentaries about things like psychopaths as we both think he is a genuine psychopath. She text me last night and said this,
""I do love him and want to support him. he did awful things and my eyes are open but it never seemed as bad as others, because he seemed as scared of himself as me and we both didn't understand how to fix""

I am honestly terrified that she will go back and I will loose her again. I don't know if I can watch her make herself ill as she makes him her everything which is what happened at the start and he strung her along for a year and he said he had moved in with his parents as he was living in a house with his ex and then we caught him still living there, then he would say he would see her that day and not come and he even did this on Christmas day, I of course rushed over and picked up the pieces and brought her to mine for Christmas. 
I just feel so helpless when she talks like this and I don't know how to help her realise that he was always abusive, every time she cried he said it made him love her a degree less ect. I could go on but I don't want this to be even longer.
I appreciate anyone's help and thank you for reading my post. 
Thank you again.
If you have any questions I will do my best to respond but I may forget to, if I do I'm sorry in advance.

He strangled me,"I live with a domestic partner who has been verbally and emotionally abusing me for 2 and half years out of the 5 years that we have been together/known each other. We met online and now live together. The violence started subtle with him pushing me onto a sofa during disagreements. Over time he would hold me down when he was angry, leaving bruises on my body. He'd shove me and threaten to punch/hit me. He threw stuff at me. He'd block the doorway not allowing me to leave and force me to listen to him. He lied often and couldn't manage his money, bounced cheques and lost our car because he couldn't make the payments. This kept me isolated and unable to work. 

I am estranged from my parents because they were abusive to me. Out of desperation I contacted my mother during violent episodes by this man. But each time she would tell me she doesn't want to hear about my problems. She wanted to enjoy her life. Even when my problems equal being shoved backwards so hard my skull nearly cracks and I injure my neck and break my finger. 

That was the worst incident until he strangled me 2 days ago. He said he did it because I was arguing with him when he wanted to sleep.

He went to sleep and I sat shaking for hours.

I called a DV number. They could barely speak English. They told me I could have temporary shelter but I'd have to abandon my cats. They are all I live for. They are my family. I can't do it. I have no friends. No one I could trust to look after them.

I called my mother again who I hadn't spoken to in 6 months and sent her photos of my strangled neck. The lease is under his name. Calling 911 would make me homeless. She suggested I call my father who I stopped talking to 20 years ago because of physical, verbal and emotional abuse. She said he's medicated now and might have changed. I didn't sleep for two days and went with her to his house (my old childhood home I still have nightmares about) and told him everything. I couldn't stop shaking and crying. I felt extreme anxiety around him. He said come back to the family we will help you. 

They're all abusive in different ways and I don't know what I'm doing. I feel like I've lost my mind. I have no one stable to talk to. No one I can trust. I think there's trauma bonding on some level. Someone please talk to me. Please.

Can't take any more,"Sorry this is going to be a very long one. Never posted on this site before I am just a reader. But I am at my wits end. I suffered domestic abuse for 15 years, threats to my family, friends if I left. (It got to the point the threats to my own life didn't matter anymore - I would have welcomed death as a way out) I was absolutely trapped, terrified and isolated. I have a child with this man, luckily the most amazing mature kid I could only have wished for, who I protected from seeing as much as I could. I begged for help from police, I knew I was in more danger leaving than when I was putting up with the abuse. Not just me at risk, but everyone I love.

 This man did the most cruel things to me through our relationship. Made me dig my own grave, strangled and beat me more times than I could count, attempted to stab me, shaved my hair off, broke my bones, beat me into losing a baby, made me quit my job, stop seeing friends, stop seeing family, was racist and violent toward my family, things I couldn't even imagine putting someone through. It was daily torture. His poor mother even took her own life as a result of his abuse and the constant mental torment of his actions to everyone else. 

 I managed to leave 6 years ago with the help and support of police, social workers, to sadly end up still living in a cycle of abuse and isolation, due to his threats. It should have been my time to heal but instead I felt more trapped than ever. I got restraining orders, he broke them, I had to have my letterbox sealed as he threatened to burn my house down and had to have alarms fit incase he came to attack me. I had no way of moving out of our hometown, I got constantly harrassed and abused to the point I tried to take my own life as my only way out.

Fast forward to 3 years ago and the abuse and threats were there but more infrequent as he would get arrested every time contact was made, (a slap on the wrist and let out again). Each time he ""slipped through the net"". I wasn't allowed to move house, wasn't allowed to move on in a relationship, he told our child he would never accept me being with anyone else and that was ""the choice I made having a kid with him"" - it meant I had to either be ""a family"" with threats, mental and physical abuse, or be on my own forever. Then he made some awful threats to her about me, said some awful things, which resulted in him being stopped contact as the social workers agreed that it was very detrimental and she was a pawn in his abuse. I spent every day looking over my shoulder, scared to even walk down the street incase he saw me and ran me over, scared to do anything that involved leading a normal life. 

I started a long road of healing myself with no idea where to start, I was consumed with fear but also a determination that I was ALMOST there, I was almost free of his clutches, every time he was arrested it was closer to him going to jail, every time he left me alone for a couple of months I regained a bit more strength and self love. I got my friends back, I got my life back, I even went on holiday with my old school friend, something I never thought I'd get a chance to do. I was becoming stronger, and more free by the day.

Then, I met a guy. 

Someone I never expected or planned to fall for, but god, I did. I consumed myself with love and happiness and found myself again, found someone I instantly and truly felt like I could love, trust, and let my walls down that were so high. The threats were still here and there but 6 years after a breakup? Who shouldn't move on after that amount of time? 

So I did. And I was happy. For the first time I saw my future with love and happiness, not fear and threats.

Then.. not even year into our relationship, my ex attacked him. Viciously and callously with no remorse or regard for life. He stabbed him, multiple times, all over his body, in his face, and made sure I heard and saw everything he had done. Luckily through numerous operations he survived, healed well, despite lasting scars and trauma. 

Now my life is upside down. My child's father is in jail, where he belongs, but a good man was hurt in the process. He is traumatised, I am traumatised, we wanted to be together, despite all this, we wanted to make it work, but now after everything, we can't fathom our way through our mental struggles that this has caused. I totally understand why he would struggle to be with me now, who wouldn't? But we convinced ourselves we could get through it, and we did the hard bit, but now, almost a year later, we have both reached a point we can't continue with the arguments and stress that we both bring to eachother with our own mental health. He has been unfaithful since, which I forgave him for multiple times as I know how his life has been turned upside down, and I tried to understand his low points,  but it has brought added stress and arguments. I have done everything possible to stand by him, help him, support him, I have foregone my own mental health to focus on his, I have never made it about me and my abuse, I didnt want to dismiss what he has been through. I just think that even I am now a lasting reminder of nearly losing his life, despite his love for me, it can't replace the trauma and I don't blame him, I'm struggling too so I can only imagine what he went through that day, and since. It's just hard because we really do love eachother, we laugh like best friends when times are good, but now things are more bad than good and it's reached a point of no return, despite both of us really wanting it to work. He has therapy once every 2 weeks but feels as though it makes him worse, dragging the memories back up that he is trying to bury. I know that no amount of burying emotions works and you have to work through them. But the more I push for this the more he would push away. He isn't a ""talk to strangers"" kind of guy despite how much I think talking helps. 

I don't know what I expect by writing this, but I needed to rant, write, whatever I could do to actually fathom how my life has ended up like this. Everyone struggles and everyone has their own life, but I really do wonder when mine will give me a break. There has been investigations within the police to see why this was even able to get to this point, I have had apologies, I have had excuses, but nothing matters now, it's all too late. 

I wrote su*cide letters to my family incase I can't hang on much longer, and I know people's first thought is selfish - her child has already lost her dad. But this is anything but. When he comes out of jail for what he has done, not even a handful of years, he will only repeat the abuse and I can not risk anyone else hurt, because of a relationship I got trapped into from 17 years old. It has already taken my life until now, I can't help but think maybe if I weren't here anymore, he would finally feel satisfied and atleast my loved ones could live free, and happy. My parents are amazing, they love my daughter like their own, she is probably bonded more with them as the years I spent trapped they helped raise her as to protect her from the abuse.

 Please don't think I am selfish, I am just lost. ","Can't take any more Sorry this is going to be a very long one. Never posted on this site before I am just a reader. But I am at my wits end.

I wasn't allowed to move house, wasn't allowed to move on in a relationship, he told our child he would never accept me being with anyone else and that was ""the choice I made having a kid with him"" - it meant I had to either be ""a family"" with threats, mental and physical abuse, or be on my own forever. Then he made some awful threats to her about me, said some awful things, which resulted in him being stopped contact as the social workers agreed that it was very detrimental and she was a pawn in his abuse. I spent every day looking over my shoulder, scared to even walk down the street incase he saw me and ran me over, scared to do anything that involved leading a normal life. 

I started a long road of healing myself with no idea where to start, I was consumed with fear but also a determination that I was ALMOST there, I was almost free of his clutches, every time he was arrested it was closer to him going to jail, every time he left me alone for a couple of months I regained a bit more strength and self love. I got my friends back, I got my life back, I even went on holiday with my old school friend, something I never thought I'd get a chance to do. I was becoming stronger, and more free by the day.

Then, I met a guy. 

Someone I never expected or planned to fall for, but god, I did. I consumed myself with love and happiness and found myself again, found someone I instantly and truly felt like I could love, trust, and let my walls down that were so high. The threats were still here and there but 6 years after a breakup? Who shouldn't move on after that amount of time? 

So I did. And I was happy. For the first time I saw my future with love and happiness, not fear and threats.

Then.. not even year into our relationship, my ex attacked him. Viciously and callously with no remorse or regard for life. He stabbed him, multiple times, all over his body, in his face, and made sure I heard and saw everything he had done. Luckily through numerous operations he survived, healed well, despite lasting scars and trauma. 

Now my life is upside down. My child's father is in jail, where he belongs, but a good man was hurt in the process. He is traumatised, I am traumatised, we wanted to be together, despite all this, we wanted to make it work, but now after everything, we can't fathom our way through our mental struggles that this has caused. I totally understand why he would struggle to be with me now, who wouldn't? But we convinced ourselves we could get through it, and we did the hard bit, but now, almost a year later, we have both reached a point we can't continue with the arguments and stress that we both bring to eachother with our own mental health. He has been unfaithful since, which I forgave him for multiple times as I know how his life has been turned upside down, and I tried to understand his low points,  but it has brought added stress and arguments. I have done everything possible to stand by him, help him, support him, I have foregone my own mental health to focus on his, I have never made it about me and my abuse, I didnt want to dismiss what he has been through. I just think that even I am now a lasting reminder of nearly losing his life, despite his love for me, it can't replace the trauma and I don't blame him, I'm struggling too so I can only imagine what he went through that day, and since. It's just hard because we really do love eachother, we laugh like best friends when times are good, but now things are more bad than good and it's reached a point of no return, despite both of us really wanting it to work. He has therapy once every 2 weeks but feels as though it makes him worse, dragging the memories back up that he is trying to bury. I know that no amount of burying emotions works and you have to work through them. But the more I push for this the more he would push away. He isn't a ""talk to strangers"" kind of guy despite how much I think talking helps. 

I don't know what I expect by writing this, but I needed to rant, write, whatever I could do to actually fathom how my life has ended up like this. Everyone struggles and everyone has their own life, but I really do wonder when mine will give me a break. There has been investigations within the police to see why this was even able to get to this point, I have had apologies, I have had excuses, but nothing matters now, it's all too late. 

I wrote su*cide letters to my family incase I can't hang on much longer, and I know people's first thought is selfish - her child has already lost her dad. But this is anything but. When he comes out of jail for what he has done, not even a handful of years, he will only repeat the abuse and I can not risk anyone else hurt, because of a relationship I got trapped into from 17 years old. It has already taken my life until now, I can't help but think maybe if I weren't here anymore, he would finally feel satisfied and atleast my loved ones could live free, and happy. My parents are amazing, they love my daughter like their own, she is probably bonded more with them as the years I spent trapped they helped raise her as to protect her from the abuse.

 Please don't think I am selfish, I am just lost. ",1,"[('beat me more times', 0.7113716006278992), ('violent toward my family', 0.7032509446144104), ('attempted to stab me', 0.7424806356430054), ('strangled and beat me', 0.7648715972900391)]",1

What kind of subtle warning signs have you all experienced when you were with your abuser? It feels really weird to look back at what happened when I was in my last relationship. I’ve only been in it for 7 months, but I’m pretty sure that it was abusive. He was mostly sexually abusive towards me. He would constantly pressure me to perform sexual acts. There was rarely ever a time when he wasn’t. Sometimes he would do things to me that I told him that I didn’t like, or that I never agreed to. He also grabbed my throat a lot.

Message my abuser’s mom and sister about him? ,"Thought about sending a message to my abuser’s mom and sister? And sending him a letter as a part of my healing journey?

And I know that his mother didn’t raise him that way, that this way of behaving towards me and abusing me is something he has learned on his own. 
I also want to say to them that I have tried to do everything for their son, and also wanted him to be better, but unfortunately it has gone on behalf of my own health. And I wish to send some pictures of chats etc and what he has done to me, just so that they don’t think I’m lying about their boy. 
I of course understand that they might take his side since they are his family. But I have been keeping my mouth shut for so long so that his name and reputation doesn’t get bad. But I do realize that I have to think about myself. I have written down a long message where I tell them I respect them and love them but this his how their son/ brother is really like.

Can couples therapy help?,"I don't know what to do. My bf and I frequently get into arguments over the way he talks to me. I often feel belittled, criticized, and I'm always the butt of his jokes. It almost feels like he's trying to disguise his put downs as jokes. For example, he'll make a joke about me being fat, old, or otherwise unattractive and then insist that it's just a joke. I've lost track of how many times I've told him to tone it down (he will make multiple, sometimes cruel, ""jokes"" like this over and over in one sitting), and I've repeatedly told him that the frequency of these ""jokes"" makes it hard for me to pass them off as just jokes when it's relentless sometimes. Whenever I tell him that these ""jokes"" aren't funny and ask him to please just stop, he will say I'm ""too sensitive"" or that I have ""a stick up my butt"". He will say that this is just how he jokes, and that by me asking him to stop, I'm asking him to change as a person. Sometimes, he'll try to punish me by saying things like, ""OK, well then I just won't joke around with you at all anymore if you're going to get so offended at everything."" Or he'll talk in a flat, intentionally boring voice afterwards, or sometimes just not talk to me at all. 

I'm frequently left feeling confused, because other than this, I feel like he does love and care for me. But this whole thing has become beyond frustrating, because he isn't acknowledging how his behavior hurts me, and he isn't willing to stop even when I've repeatedly told him how much it bothers me. He just dismisses my feelings, and I know this is a big red flag. 

I feel like couples therapy might be our best chance at fixing this, but I get mixed signals from him on whether or not he's willing to try. He's told me that he doesn't want to do couples therapy because he doesn't trust that a therapist will actually try to help (because he thinks they have a financial incentive to keep us fighting/coming back). But he's also told me that this is the best relationship he's been in, and that he'll do whatever it takes to make it work. The real problem is, neither of us have the money for it right now.

Helping a friend gone wrong ,"So my best friend (24F) called me (24F) to pick her up. I told her I was with my boyfriend (25M) and that we definitely can, he just needed to drive because I struggle driving at night. On the way there, I knew that my bestie and her boyfriend (26-28 M not sure 100% on his age) had gotten into an argument at the bar and she just wanted to leave. I asked her if she wanted to go to her mom’s and she told me she wanted to get her car which was at his place. Once we picked her up, she was drunk and said she was going to stay with him. When we got towards his house he tried to call her and she didn’t answer because we were close anyways. I didn’t realize he had left her at the bar, I thought she just wanted to go home which immediately made me anxious. Before she left, she wanted to show my boyfriend and I something funny on her phone. Out of no where I look up, and her boyfriend got into his car and started driving it super fast head first at my car and essentially boxed us in where we were parked so we couldn’t just drive off and leave. He came incredibly close to hitting it with maybe an inch or two gap between our cars. My friend got out of the car to talk to him, my boyfriend locked the car doors, and then her boyfriend got out of his car and started screaming at everyone. Thank god my boyfriend had locked the car doors too because he tried to open them on my side then his and was pulling on the door handles and just saying a lot of rude stuff, which I can’t even fully remember because I was so anxious I almost threw up. My boyfriend put my car in reverse to try to maneuver around his car which he ended up moving after my friend told him she would bust his windshield open if he didn’t leave us alone. Apparently he thought that she was hanging out with another man because he had no clue that the man in the car was my boyfriend but he was acting irrational.

I messaged my friend today to let her know I’m here if she needs to talk, and that I love her to pieces, but that I can’t be caught in the cross fires. I feel like it put my safety at risk as well as my boyfriend’s. I was super nice over the text to emphasize I’m still there for her I just don’t want to get stuck in the middle of it again because it was terrifying.

Her boyfriend has a huge temper, a drinking problem, and has beat the crap out of her repeatedly. I feel bad telling her that I can’t really help her out in those situations but all I could think of last night was what if her boyfriend had a weapon, hurt me or my boyfriend, damaged my car, etc the list goes on and on.

Help!! How did you realize you were in an abusive relationship?,"I'd like to hear from others experiences. Like many people when I think about abusive relationships I imagine a person who physically hurts someone, yells at them, humiliate them in public etc etc. But it's much harder to recognize abuse when it's not that overt. It doesn't help that I have low self-esteem that comes from childhood abuse.

I've been married for 18 years, two kids. He used to be sweet and kind in the beginning but over the years he has become increasingly self centered. Look, I try to be realistic about marriage, I have my shortcomings too and far from perfect and I know all marriages inevitably change with time. But I feel like I might be in denial and the thought of getting a divorce feels terrifying. But here are some personal examples:

- He used to apologize when he hurt my feelings. That hardly ever happens now. If I bring it up he usually gets defensive. When something goes wrong he acts like it was either me or the kids' fault.

 - When I had our babies both times I asked him to spend the night at the hospital with me but he said there was no bed for him there and he needed to rest. With our first child he even slept in and got a the hospital at noon the next day.

- I love talking about politics and social issues (I have a bachelors in Sociology). He's not that interested in those topics, which is fine, it's not for everyone. But when I start talking about it after a few minutes he'll act uninterested, sometimes straight up say it or even roll his eyes. Mind you, when he talks about his own interests I at least try to listen.

- Housework basically falls on me. We have a big house and it's overwhelming for me (I also work outside the house). The thing he basically does is to load and unload the dishwasher. When I complain about him not doing more around the house he gets defensive (again) and says I should relax about chores because I'm too picky about cleanliness. He'll then claim hes doing work equally since he's the one mowing the lawn and shoveling snow. But those are things that need to be done only during a few months a year, and the snow shoveling is basically done by our 14 year old now.

- At night when he and the kids go to bed I stay up to clean the kitchen. The next day he complains that I made too much noise cleaning the kitchen and interrupted his sleep. And if I say ""well someone has to clean it"", he again gets defensive and says ""I can do it in the morning (he works from home), but then he doesn't most of the time.

- He belittles my job and says I should get one that pays better. But he says it in a subtle way like ""you deserve better"", which is probably true, but I feel like he just wants me to make more money so he can quit his current job and become a college professor, which will basically pay 1/2 of what he makes now. Mind you, I've always been supportive of him becoming a professor. My current job is 25 hours a week but I feel like even if I get one thats 40 hours and make more money the house work thing will not change that much. He was unemployed a while ago for 4 months and would be on the couch all day, watching tv or or his phone. I'd get home from work and make dinner, do laundry and cleaning. 

- If we both have work meetings at the same time he expects me to figure out a way to pick up the kids at school.

- When I'm really really overwhelmed I might ask him to do the grocery shopping (I do it 99% of the time). He does it but makes a bug fuss. 

- a lot of times when I need to vent about something he'll find a way to make it about himself. I traveled to my home country during summer and when I came home I was really said and crying a lot because I missed my country and it was difficult ""transitioning"" back to my old routine. He seemed puzzled by my emotions and kinda annoyed, if you know what I mean. 

- When we go out as a family (when we can actually get him to want to go) a lot of times he'll become impatient and look bored. So for the past few years I just take the kids out myself, and tbh the mood feels ""lighter"". He has a hard time relaxing and being flexible. Everything has to be planned and timely, including vacations and outings. 

Sorry for the long post. But I feel I need to come to terms and find out if I really am in an abusive relationship, and if counseling can fix it or it its beyond salvation now. I appreciate any inputs from those who have been through similar situation. ","Help!! How did you realize you were in an abusive relationship? I'd like to hear from others experiences. Like many people when I think about abusive relationships I imagine a person who physically hurts someone, yells at them, humiliate them in public etc etc. But it's much harder to recognize abuse when it's not that overt. It doesn't help that I have low self-esteem that comes from childhood abuse.

I've been married for 18 years, two kids. He used to be sweet and kind in the beginning but over the years he has become increasingly self centered. Look, I try to be realistic about marriage, I have my shortcomings too and far from perfect and I know all marriages inevitably change with time. But I feel like I might be in denial and the thought of getting a divorce feels terrifying. But here are some personal examples:

- He used to apologize when he hurt my feelings. That hardly ever happens now. If I bring it up he usually gets defensive. When something goes wrong he acts like it was either me or the kids' fault.

 - When I had our babies both times I asked him to spend the night at the hospital with me but he said there was no bed for him there and he needed to rest. With our first child he even slept in and got a the hospital at noon the next day.

- I love talking about politics and social issues (I have a bachelors in Sociology). He's not that interested in those topics, which is fine, it's not for everyone. But when I start talking about it after a few minutes he'll act uninterested, sometimes straight up say it or even roll his eyes. Mind you, when he talks about his own interests I at least try to listen.

- Housework basically falls on me. We have a big house and it's overwhelming for me (I also work outside the house). The thing he basically does is to load and unload the dishwasher. When I complain about him not doing more around the house he gets defensive (again) and says I should relax about chores because I'm too picky about cleanliness. He'll then claim hes doing work equally since he's the one mowing the lawn and shoveling snow. But those are things that need to be done only during a few months a year, and the snow shoveling is basically done by our 14 year old now.

- At night when he and the kids go to bed I stay up to clean the kitchen. The next day he complains that I made too much noise cleaning the kitchen and interrupted his sleep. And if I say ""well someone has to clean it"", he again gets defensive and says ""I can do it in the morning (he works from home), but then he doesn't most of the time.

- He belittles my job and says I should get one that pays better. But he says it in a subtle way like ""you deserve better"", which is probably true, but I feel like he just wants me to make more money so he can quit his current job and become a college professor, which will basically pay 1/2 of what he makes now. Mind you, I've always been supportive of him becoming a professor. My current job is 25 hours a week but I feel like even if I get one thats 40 hours and make more money the house work thing will not change that much. He was unemployed a while ago for 4 months and would be on the couch all day, watching tv or or his phone. I'd get home from work and make dinner, do laundry and cleaning. 

- If we both have work meetings at the same time he expects me to figure out a way to pick up the kids at school.

- When I'm really really overwhelmed I might ask him to do the grocery shopping (I do it 99% of the time). He does it but makes a bug fuss.

I want to discuss something that I believe needs to be talked about more in conversations about domestic violence.,"There are some abusive acts that my abuser does that put me in harms way, without ever touching me with the intention to cause me harm. 

But they are still violence. 

The purpose is to cause fear and intimidation by aggressive displays of their physical dominance or control over your physical safety. 

And when one person is willing to participate in violence and the other is not, that gives them power. They are willing to get that power through fear. 

These may include:

- Driving recklessly with me in the car 
- Throwing objects close to or towards me 
- Smashing or breaking property close to me where glass or wood splinters are flying 
- Continuing aggressive and intimidating  behaviour when they can see I am in a state of physical distress from the stress of their abuse i.e. having cardiac symptoms from stress, and they do not stop, they keep going. This puts my health and safety at risk.  

Another abusive act that my abuser does is harm themselves through destruction of property by punching walls or slamming furniture etc. 

This is still using aggression and fear for power because 

1) Then my entire focus shifts off of their abusive behaviour to if they are they okay and I have to tend to their injuries 

2) I am then left to always be mitigating every situation out of not only fear that they will cause me harm but also cause themselves harm, and I don’t ever know what they are going to do or how far they are going to take that. 

I just don’t see these forms of domestic violence and their intentions discussed so often.

Today is 2 years since Gabby was found. Her family is still grieving but you can help them: they want to hear your survivor stories & how their daughter helped you personally.,"Today is 2 years since Gabby Petito was found. It's especially hard for her family because of how much pain today brought them. I am a friend of her mom & her stepmom & volunteer for the foundation. We talk almost every day and they are 2 of the kindest, most caring people I've ever met. It's easy to see where gabby got it from.

I want to help my friends heal. What really helps them heal is reading survivor stories and stories of how their daughter's story helped people.


Please post comments and stories here of how Gabby has helped you personally and any messages you'd like me to pass along. Please don't express condolences. I know they are well intended but it's like a broken record, it doesn't help them. Positive stories, anything of how Gabby has helped you, does help them. She has saved lives, we've gotten emails and it's absolutely incredible.

If you don't feel comfortable here, you can PM me or [use the contact form at the bottom of the foundation website](https://www.gabbypetitofoundation.org/).

Also please mention if you'd be okay with the foundation using your comment in their blog (with credit).

Event From My Ex's Past I'd Like Input In,"This as a thing from past, but since I struggle to internalise all of these things and I need to vent and look for validation and input.

I'm no longer with this person, we had plenty of issues and situations, I still struggle to even wrap my head around what all in our relationship was domestic violence. This is an event from time before we were together.

So he lived at his parents with his girlfriend. One day he strangled her, until she blacked out. When us, his friends, heard this story he never said it was his fault or that he did something wrong. They did call the police, he spent night in the cell, to calm down as he said.

He blamed this event on his depression and her passive aggressiveness. Always. Only once did he show any shame or guilt about it when he was absolutely broken and crying about what a horrible person he is.

Yet, the weird part and the part I'd like your opinion on. His parents were absolutely fine with her not pressing charges. Now knowing my own parents if I had been him they would have pressured her to press charges.","Event From My Ex's Past I'd Like Input In This as a thing from past, but since I struggle to internalise all of these things and I need to vent and look for validation and input.

I keep asking for a sign whether or not to contact my ex..,"I feel like at this point I have nothing to lose. 

Three things could happen:

1) He ignores my message.

2) He replies saying something like ""fuck off, you broke up with me. I've moved on."" etc.

3) He replies saying something like he misses me too.

None of these possible scenarios could make me more miserable than I am now.

is this considered abuse? (im a teenager),"hi, im a teenager and i created a burner just for this so that he can't find it or something.  there have been a couple instances where my dad ( twice my size) has hurt me; but i know he loves me yet has never said sorry. he yells a LOT and will threaten to hurt me and my younger brother sometimes but never carries them out and will also threaten to break stuff like our phones or other electronics (he's been doing so since i was really little).

there was an instance where he shoved 7 year old me into a wall when my mom wasn't home because i wouldn't brush my teeth. more recently, last winter, he dragged me off my bed by my hair, then kicked me when i fell onto the floor because i wanted to finish my homework before showering. i did cry and told him to stop because it truly did hurt, especially because when i was kicked my head hit the leg of a chair in my room.
 
im not sure if this is considered serious abuse or something that puts me in danger. i've told my mom yet she won't do anything, so i've come to reddit for this question 🤷‍♀️
there have been also MANY instances where he'll insult me/bring me down if i do small things he doesn't agree with, and will belittle me and call me names. stuff like insulting my weight, what i look like, saying i have no friends because of xxx, stuff like that. and i admit that it makes me afraid to do anything that makes me stand out in front of him. i doubt he'll hurt me again but im afraid to tell anyone incase he gets mad

i doubt he means to hurt me and im pretty sure his parents treated him the same way when he was a child. i know he truly does love me, but i also know that he shouldn't threaten to smack me when i make a snide comment","is this considered abuse?
