"Abused by husband, his friends, and his family. With NO help from anyone!!","I've been drugged with fentanyl, strangled 5 times, my entire face, chest, and neck bruised, had my suicide attempt recorded, shared, and mocked, lied to, lied about (to my kids and even police), denied medical attention for 2.5 years, with a terminal condition, forced to walk home after 12hr shifts, had my grandma's rosary, a doll she gave me, and HER ASHES thrown in a trash compactor, called worthless, useless, fat (after losing 80lbs), my rent money stolen(lost my house), my car totaled(never replaced), my inheritance from my grandma stolen and used to send to other women & take them to nice hotels, been publicly humiliated, had to move into our car for my birthday, he wrecked that so then a tent when it was freezing, no heat or bathroom,  and have had radiation forced on me every single day for the last year and a half, the cartilage in my nose and ears is crushed/crumbled. If I leave then my daughter's life was threatened. My family won't help, police won't help, nobody believes me. So I have only 2 choices; continue to sit through this pain and let all of them torture me until they kill me or end it myself. A healthy grown man would tap out from this shit (forced radiation). I can't handle much more.   And people think that I am the Anti-Christ & he is a ""good guy""....an abused husband.  He is definitely NOT.","Abused by husband, his friends, and his family.

Having trouble going to the police about my (EX) boyfriend strangling me,"My (ex) boyfriend strangled me last Thursday. This is the first time he ever strangled me. We do have a pending court case for the last time he assaulted me. I am still in shock.

I did not go to the police. I told him if he let me go home to my mother & father that I wouldn't call.

I do have a video and text message proof that this happened.

I know I should definitely report this, but carrying the weight of being the reason why someone goes to prison is unnerving to me. On the other hand, I feel like I'll be angry down the line in time because I didn't do anything about it and let him get away with doing such a thing to me. 

Part of me feels like I'm over reacting because he only strangled me for less than 10 seconds. Is it worth it to ruin someone's life for less than 10 seconds?

Brother strangled me called the police no regrets ,"My (29 F) and brother (31 M) had an altercation.
I don’t want to write too much about myself but let’s just say I’m from the south asian community and abuse and toxic family dynamics have always been involved in my family. I was abused by my parents and siblings all my life I’m not innocent either I normally fight back because I am being abused or just have to defend myself or others sometimes. 

I was asking for something really simple and my brother just got really angry and because I was reaching to show him he pushed me back and grabbed my throat and was shouting and swearing. I got really angry and swore back and said I’m going to call the police because he did this. My younger brother (25 m) just came and intervened and I was trying to remove him but he was not going. I know this sounds really bad but in the Muslim Asian community violence and even getting the police involved is like bringing shame to the family. They always say be patient or your family but this is still injustice. I called the police for  some seconds and I know this seems really bad but I just wanted to scare him so he could leave. I didn’t think they could hear through the voice mail or message where they ask you what department you want but they heard all the commotion. 

I’m just tired of being abused of being told because we’re Asian we can’t do that or because we’re Muslim we have to tolerate it. I got scared and lied that nothing happened and we were just having an argument to the police regarding another matter . I would’ve been kicked out of my house even in Asian families women don’t move out until they get married. I honestly hate what’s happening I hate the fact I’ve just been told to tolerate abuse cause of my ethnicity and I’m stuck with these toxic people. I’m trying everything to just get better but there are people like this.

My best friend was murdered by her ex,"I’m telling this story as a cautionary tale. On February 3 of 2025, my best friend was brutally murdered by her ex boyfriend. He waited in her car until she got off work. Got her to go to a more secluded location. And some time after that, he stabbed her 40+ times and left her in the trunk of her own car. He then drove to our local mall and met up with a friend. He showed this friend what he did, and thankfully that friend called the police. 

This is how it ended, I’m going to tell you how it all started. It started in high school. It started with him threatening to kill himself to get her to hang out with him. 

It started with something that small. It escalated quickly. She told me about a night when he got angry with her, and he started strangling her until she was blue in the face. He still lived with his parents at the time. She told me the look in his eyes was really scary. “It’s like he wasn’t there anymore.” Or something to that effect. He had cheated multiple times by this point. Only a year or two into the relationship.

There was a night in 2020 on his own birthday, where we decided he wanted to kill himself. He was high and drunk. He got in her car, and she got in with him. She honestly wanted what was best for him. She really did love him at the time. And when she got him to pull over, she took the keys and ran away. He very quickly caught up to her and tackled her through a fence. The took the keys and took off in the car. He got into two hit and runs. They had a no contact order in place when he got to jail. He was only sentenced to 6 months. Though his rap sheet should’ve put him away longer. He committed grand theft auto, two hit and runs, DUI, simple domestic assault, and other minor charges. He broke the no contact order by calling a friend and having that friend connect their calls. He would send letters to a friend and word them in a way where he was talking about her, and not to her. So they would get to her. And by this point he had torn down her self esteem so much, she thought she was nothing without him.

When he finally got out, she gave up her life to help him. She took him to see his PO, and he pissed dirty every damn time. He spent a weekend in jail and then left. Then he’d do it all over again. He kept breaking parole. She worked her ass off to cover amenities for him. Drugs, food, and eventually rent when they moved in together. He kept cheating. He was about 19 or 20, and he had sex with a fucking 15 year old. Both corroborated this account. The girl and fuck face.

He cheated so much he caught an STD and gave it to her. She had to get a shot for it. He knowingly gave her an STD. He also raped her several times through coercion and she told me a few times she woke up with him on top of her. She would say fine just to get it over with. He would strangle her during these rapes, to the point of passing out and having seizures. I don’t know how often it was consensual. She said having sex with him hurt her.

There was a night she came over to my place when I still lived at home. Because he had gotten drunk and had beaten the shit out of her. She said she got in her car naked, it’s hard to think about what events lead up to this. She had some clothes with her. And she stayed at my place for two nights to avoid him. His mother came over the next day after the beating. I don’t remember everything she said, but something that is seared into my brain forever “you know he loves you, right?” I hate that woman. Who is herself a battered woman. And she put my friend in danger. I had to go to work the day after the dumb bitch came over. And that woman left my friend ALONE with fuck face. So they could “talk it out”. My friend was thankfully not killed that day. But the possibility was there and it bothered me so much.

It took me nearly two years of tough love to get through to her. No one else, was telling her what she really needed to hear. Which, honestly, pissed me off to no end. We had to take an 8 month break. It was so fucking exhausting constantly worrying about her. 

It wasn’t too long after this that she finally broke it off with him. This relationship spanned 5 years, one miscarriage and two abortions. She was so thankful she never had a kid with him. But the contact never stopped. She do t cut contact because he threatened her life, my life, her cat, and her family. She felt like she couldn’t go to the police, because they had been oooh so useful up until this point. 

They had been broken up for about two or so years. He never fucking let go.

There was a day he wanted to hang out, and she didn’t feel up to it. So that night he came over and busted out her back windshield and slashed all her tires. The police were called and a report was filed. Nothing ever came of it. Then nothing major happened for a while. Until earlier this year. At the end of last year, we moved to another state with his family. Then he decided to come back. And he stalked her relentlessly. Contacted her at 3 in the fucking morning even though she had to work (I didn’t know this until after everything happened). He would get mad if she fell asleep on him. And he would prattle on and on about useless shit. 

Then the first of February. Her birthday. He apparently tried to get in her car very late that night. To leave a “gift”. Then he tried to get into her car on the second. Couldn’t, so he left and set an alarm to try again later. Apparently he over slept the alarm. So on the third he finally did what he wanted… she texted me. Just before everything happened. And I’m glad I got to tell her I loved her. Something didn’t feel right about the texts. But I couldn’t put a finger on it. She told me she was going to her parents’ place to hide out from him. But it haunts me I couldn’t do anything for her. She protected me in her final moments…

I got the call at about 10:30 that night. I was stressing because the police did a wellness check. They heard she had a roommate so they wanted to make sure I was safe. They don’t tell me what happened. Because they hadn’t talked to her family yet. I felt so numb. I couldn’t eat for two days. Her dad informed me of what happened. And it felt like I was dunked in the arctic water. I felt sick. I couldn’t breathe. I knew immediately who had done it before anyone told me. It could only be one person. 

I’m telling you this, because you need to leave as soon as possible. Get help as soon as possible. Go to women’s shelters. They have advocates there. People that will advocate for you when you go to the police. You need someone to really be there. They can give you all the resources. 

GET THE FUCK AWAY! I mean this with all the love. He doesn’t fucking love you. He loves an idea. And the second you don’t fit that idea, the second you show you are your own person. It will piss him off. Control is all he cares about. If he hits you, he will do it again. If he strangles you, he will *kill* you. 

I always knew this was a strong possibility. I’ve never wanted to be more wrong in my life. God how I wish I could’ve take her place. 

She was such a sweet, kind and beautiful woman. I feel so lucky to have spent this time with her. She had the warmest hugs. Ones that you needed no matter how you felt. Her smile could light up a room. Her laugh was so contagious and I found it endearing. She always hated it. She was beautiful inside and out. She was so compassionate, even to those who didn’t fucking deserve it. I love her. She was like my sister. I wouldn’t change our time together for the world. But I’d give my life to bring her back in a heartbeat. 

She never felt safe enough to use her voice. So I’ll be her voice.

Sorry if this is a jumbled mess. I just really need to get this out there. I want her story to be told. I want other people to learn from this. I can’t stand seeing this shit anymore. This happens all too often. If I can reach even one person. Then I’m doing something right.

I wanted so badly to be her shield. She ended up being mine. So now I’ll be her sword.","My best friend was murdered by her ex I’m telling this story as a cautionary tale.

It wasn’t too long after this that she finally broke it off with him. This relationship spanned 5 years, one miscarriage and two abortions. She was so thankful she never had a kid with him. But the contact never stopped. She do t cut contact because he threatened her life, my life, her cat, and her family. She felt like she couldn’t go to the police, because they had been oooh so useful up until this point. 

They had been broken up for about two or so years. He never fucking let go.

There was a day he wanted to hang out, and she didn’t feel up to it. So that night he came over and busted out her back windshield and slashed all her tires. The police were called and a report was filed. Nothing ever came of it. Then nothing major happened for a while. Until earlier this year. At the end of last year, we moved to another state with his family. Then he decided to come back. And he stalked her relentlessly. Contacted her at 3 in the fucking morning even though she had to work (I didn’t know this until after everything happened). He would get mad if she fell asleep on him. And he would prattle on and on about useless shit. 

Then the first of February. Her birthday. He apparently tried to get in her car very late that night. To leave a “gift”. Then he tried to get into her car on the second. Couldn’t, so he left and set an alarm to try again later. Apparently he over slept the alarm. So on the third he finally did what he wanted… she texted me. Just before everything happened. And I’m glad I got to tell her I loved her. Something didn’t feel right about the texts. But I couldn’t put a finger on it. She told me she was going to her parents’ place to hide out from him. But it haunts me I couldn’t do anything for her. She protected me in her final moments…

I got the call at about 10:30 that night. I was stressing because the police did a wellness check. They heard she had a roommate so they wanted to make sure I was safe. They don’t tell me what happened. Because they hadn’t talked to her family yet. I felt so numb. I couldn’t eat for two days. Her dad informed me of what happened. And it felt like I was dunked in the arctic water. I felt sick. I couldn’t breathe. I knew immediately who had done it before anyone told me. It could only be one person. 

I’m telling you this, because you need to leave as soon as possible. Get help as soon as possible. Go to women’s shelters. They have advocates there. People that will advocate for you when you go to the police. You need someone to really be there. They can give you all the resources. 

GET THE FUCK AWAY! I mean this with all the love. He doesn’t fucking love you. He loves an idea. And the second you don’t fit that idea, the second you show you are your own person. It will piss him off. Control is all he cares about. If he hits you, he will do it again. If he strangles you, he will *kill* you. 

I always knew this was a strong possibility. I’ve never wanted to be more wrong in my life. God how I wish I could’ve take her place. 

She was such a sweet, kind and beautiful woman. I feel so lucky to have spent this time with her. She had the warmest hugs. Ones that you needed no matter how you felt. Her smile could light up a room. Her laugh was so contagious and I found it endearing. She always hated it. She was beautiful inside and out. She was so compassionate, even to those who didn’t fucking deserve it. I love her. She was like my sister. I wouldn’t change our time together for the world. But I’d give my life to bring her back in a heartbeat. 

She never felt safe enough to use her voice. So I’ll be her voice.

Sorry if this is a jumbled mess. I just really need to get this out there. I want her story to be told. I want other people to learn from this. I can’t stand seeing this shit anymore. This happens all too often. If I can reach even one person. Then I’m doing something right.

I wanted so badly to be her shield. She ended up being mine. So now I’ll be her sword.",1,"[('he strangles you', 0.7414145469665527), ('wanted to kill', 0.75282883644104), ('strangles you he', 0.7810757160186768)]",1

Witnessed domestic violence at age of 3.,"So Back in 2012 (yes im still pretty young) my dad was abusive toward my mother. I don’t remember anything except when I witnessed what my dad did to my mom.

I saw him beating up my mom, I was watching quietly, I did nothing, not even a scream of terror or cry. I just watched immobile terrified what I was witnessing. I was supposed to be outside playing with my 2 older sisters, not witnessing something that would change my life. And I still have very precise memory from this specific moment.

At the time I was the youngest of the family (3y old), one of my sister was 7 years old at the time and the other sister was 10 years old. I think in the familly I was the only one to have witnessed the domestic violence.

My dad was not abusive toward us, but he was neglecting us. One time (I don’t remember it) he locked up me and my 2 sisters in the car, for no reason.

And yes there were dramatic consequences to what I witnessed. After that my mom saw that I was starting to have trouble speaking, and that my motor skills were worse than before. I got diagnosed with dyspraxia and dysphasia (or aphasia, idk what its called).

My parents divorced the same year (2012). And my dad went back to live in portugal like 2 years after (I live in central europe.) and since then I very rarely see him. and the year after the incident I got nightmares frequently. I had PTSD when I was like 4!

At the end the only thing that help me cope with these memories are my plushies. I do not age regress, I am very very attached to my plushies. Its my only way I can feel better and feel understood. Even if im a male I don’t feel ashamed by that fortunately.","Witnessed domestic violence at age of 3. So Back in 2012 (yes im still pretty young) my dad was abusive toward my mother.

This morning I was strangled,"I am still crying and trying to breathe. About an hour ago I yelled at my spouce for being mean to the kids. I stupidly went up to his face or just towards him and yelled.

I remember when I met him, he was the perfect boyfriend ever, he got me gifts and flowers and give me so much attention and love, I thought he's the one and I'm gonna marry him in future. Later in relationship, one night we were drinking with our friends from work and watching football and I took his phone to take a photo and then accidentally  discovered he was texting to his ex girlfriend, I read messages while I was sitting next to him, he was telling her how much he misses her, that he wants to get back together with her, that she's the only girl he ever loved and stuff like that. I got so angry and confronted him about it right away and he just said we will talk later. I said okay but I couldn't act like nothing is going on and I distanced myself from him right away meanwhile he was acting like nothing happened, he was hugging me, holding my hand, tried to kiss me couple times while I was refusing and trying constantly to move away from him. Then he got up and said let's go to my room to talk so I went with him. And that was the night I should've left him for good and stopped everything with him. In the room he was trying to manipulate me saying ""That's just the way I was trying to leave her, I couldn't leave her just over night, you don't understand we were together for couple of years ... "" and that made me even more angry because he said he's single and that they broke up long ago and he told me that they did brake up long ago but they still had contact and some kind of weird relationship between them and that's the way he was trying to put an end on it. I didn't believe any of things he said, I was still very angry with him, I wanted to leave him and to go home. That's when he started to get little aggressive and saying that I annoy him with my behavior and that he doesn't fear anybody except Allah (he's muslim) and that his God will protect him and take care of him despite whatever he did in life, he's not scared of police or anything except his God. I was terrified with that things he said because he said it like he's going to do something to me and I got scared really quick and wanted even more to go home and so I started telling him everything is okay and I'm just tired and I wanna go home because I'm working tomorrow. That's when he punched the table in front of me and told me to stop acting like I was scared of him and like he's going to hurt me or whatever and I thought to myself..well he had couple of drinks, he's hurt and probably don't wanna lose me, he's a good guy that's just alcohol, I can help him, I think he loves me and stuff.. So I calmed him down little by little, I told him that I know he won't hurt me ever because I know he loves me and he really calmed down and sat next to me and we hugged some time and kissed, and when everything cooled off I went home. After that he really broke off everything with his ex, told her that he met me and that he loves me (He showed me messages) and everything went back to normal. He was again that perfect guy and I fell in love even more. We had beautiful relationship, we took care of each other, supported each other and we were very much in love and almost always together. We also worked at the same place, except I had day shift cause I was waitress and he was working nights cause he was in bakery. He lived in rooms next to our workplace and everytime I slept at his place he was checking up on me every chance he had and it was pretty nice. He would come on break in the middle of the night and cover me while I was sleeping with blanket, If I woke up he would ask me if I was hungry or thirsty or do I need anything. He was perfect. After couple of months something changed in him, it's like he started drinking,  acting possessive, wanted me to he with him 24/7, he wouldn't let me go home change my stuff or take some other clothes to wear, he would just wash it there and say "" I washed your clothes here they are clean you can wear them, no need to go home "" and I was like well I wanna wear something else, I don't wanna be always in the same clothes, and he always responded something like "" i don't care what you wear I love you the way you are, that doesn't matter to me "" . And he knew exactly how to melt my heart ( manipulate me ) so I didn't see how crazy all of that was, I was working at a place where he was constantly there checking up on me and then after work spend time with him and sleep at his place. After a week or two I really was little tired and wanted to have some me time so I can do skin care or something else, I just wanted to be little alone and at my home and I left, and every time I left he was acting like he misses me, he was texting me like he was depressed because I'm not there and I was like babe chill I just went home it's perfectly normal like we're gonna see each other tomorrow. But he kept saying stuff like that and somehow manipulated me to go back to his place or he will come to mine. I still loved me but It became too much for me to be constantly with him, I was feeling like I was trapped or in a cage cause I couldn't go anywhere or do anything. And as I started to go more home and distanced myself from him, he then started to put pressure on me that he wants us to get married, have kids start a family move in together and stuff, and I always said it's too early cause I was like 21 and he was 25 at the time, we were so young for that, I wasn't ready to start married life and have family. After a while he started drinking, like every day, he stopped sleeping, was always with his friend at bars drinking. I was always there for him cause I knew he has rough time, I just didn't know why and I just was there for him and waited for him to open up so I can help him, I didn't wanted to put any pressure on him. As the time went by, he was changing his behavior more and more and was drunk every day, he would get up and instead of breakfast he would just open a bottle of beer and started day with that and then continue till evening to drink. He was at the time still putting pressure on me, still was acting possessive and got jealous over nothing, he was paranoid and stuff, I didn't wanted to argue cause he was drunk all the time and I didn't wanted to make him mad cause I was scared of him. I was planning to slowly distance myself from him and eventually I would end the relationship. I wasn't feeling it anymore and person I fall for wasn't there anymore,  he was totally different and I didn't know who that person was and I just wanted to leave mostly because he was drinking too much. And I think he also knew that, he knew deep down. One day, our mutual friend was leaving the country and we wanted to meet all together and have couple of drinks and say goodbye. I was home getting ready and texting him all the time and just by vibes on texts it seemed like something was off. I called him and we spoke, and I asked him was he drinking today and he swore that he wasn't and that he had just like 1 beer, but I could tell he was drunk but decided to still meet with him cause I wanted to say goodbye to my friend and have some drinks myself. We meet later in a bar near our workplace and since he came I noticed he was waisted, I whispered to him and asked why he lied to me and he said he didn't and that he wasn't drunk at all, but he could barely talk normally. I was still little mad but I decided I'm not going to let him ruin my mood and was chilling. There were parents and two children from our mutual friend and that friend also and we were hanging and talking, and it was fun. At one point of the evening my boyfriend gave some money to the kids and started saying to me "" give them something, don't be like that, they are just little kids, how can you be like that "" and I was confused because I first off didn't do anything and I really didn't had money on me, I was always paying everything with card. And he knew that very well. Then he started putting money in my pockets and saying to me out loud like "" here you go, I'm gonna give you money since you don't have, just give it to the kids its nice thing to do "" and he kept saying that in way like I had something against the kids and I was very confused and asked him what is his problem, I told him I don't have anything against the kids and asked him to stop making me look bad in front of others. Then he started saying to me that I stop with my behavior, that I always ruin everything, he was asking me to be normal just this night and not to make drama or something, and that made me so mad cause I could tell he was ghosting me into thinking I'm the problem and like it's my fault and It never was. So I got up and said I'm gonna go home and then he pulled me from the table and told me to go, he threw my bag in front of me and shouted at me to leave, that I was this and this, so I picked my bag and I left. And guess what, he left right away with me, behind the bar he started yelling at me and I had enough at that point I was just like ""okay you're right, I'm just gonna go home we're over"". And then he hit me, he slapped me so hard and I remember at the moment that I couldn't believe that just happened, I remember just looking at him and  being completely shocked. I wanted to leave immediately but he started pulling me for my hair and hands and slapping me even more, and I was definitely making noise with every slap I got, but nobody did anything, nobody came to stop him. He started dragging me back to his place and I remember all the time he was telling me "" I'm gonna kill you when we get home. This is the last time you did this to me. I'm gonna kill you now I swear to Allah I am not afraid of anything I'm gonna kill you when we come home, you're dead "" and that scared me so much I sarted to pull and try to escape so badly but he kept hitting me and was stronger and bigger then me so I couldn't escpae. There were also some people passing on the street and only one them said something like ' leave the girl alone ' and he responded ' she's mine. I can do whatever I want with her' and that's it, nobody did anything,  everyone was just passing and looking like it was nothing going on while he was threatening me and hitting me on the street while I was trying to escape from him. We were close to his place and I knew that if I go up to that room I'm going to die, and I knew that I have to escape no matter what cause I don't wanna die, I kept thinking don't give up, if you go up there you're going to die, nobody can help you. When we came near the workplace, right in front of the stairs that led upstairs to his place I started pulling even more, I gathered every peace of strength I had and pulled away, he threw me on the ground and started strangling me right there on spot.. I remember it like it was yesterday.. I couldn't breathe, I felt so scared, like never before, I looked right at his eyes while he was strangling me and I didn't see anything, his eyes were empty, it looked like there was nobody behind them, like there's no person behind those eyes, pure emptiness. That scared me much more and while I was trying to defend myself and pulling his hands from my neck I kicked the pile of of boxes with empty bottles of drinks we served at restaurant and that made a huge noise. People from the garden ( the guests ) started looking around to see what happened and he saw that they are going to see him strangling me and as soon as felt he was distracted I pushed him and started yelling "" help he's trying to kill me! "" 
I couldn't yell loud cause I was trying at the same time to catch a breath but somehow I gathered strength to yell even louder every time cause I knew that was my only chance to escape this man. So the people heard me and came right away and I ran to them and started crying and shaking and I remember he was saying to them I was overreacting, that I was his girl and that I was drunk and he's just trying to get me home to bed and I was right away started yelling that he's lying and that he tried to kill me. People believed me cause I was covered in bruises, my hair was messy and half plucked. My coworker's at the time got me inside of restaurant and tried to calm me down and help me, they called the police and boss cause it happened inside of his property and I was just there.. Shaking, crying, I couldn't believe that actually happened, I couldn't believe that I could die, it all seemed like a horror movie.. They were all there asking me what happened, am I okay and I couldn't talk properly, I just fell into shock. After some time, police came and took me to hospital and I told them what happened. Later I found out he escaped right away from there and that police couldn't find him. My brother picked me up from hospital and took me home and stayed with me to watch for me in case he comes to my home and tries to hurt me. I was scared for my life. I kept thinking he's going to come back to finsih what he started, he's even more angrier now, he's going to find me and kill me. Day after I found out police arrested him, I also found out he got fired and left that place where he lived and went back to his country. Before that I heard from him once and saw him outside, he was sleeping on the street and benches and I offered him to come to my place to take a shower cause he was so dirty and looking really bad and I felt bad so I did the most stupid thing ever, and I did took him to my home but I first made a call to my roommates and neighborsso they know and can protect me if he tries anything. I washed his clothes, let him wash himself and warmed him enough and let him go, and I told him then this is the last time he sees me, and that I can't forgive or forget what he did to me, he apologized to me and told me he love me but I just couldn't forgive him for that so I escorted him out from my house and never saw him again after that. I also didn't press any charges, only the state sentenced him and deported him back to his country. And that's the end, after some time I got back on my job and started living normal life. But to this day I remember everything, every word, every emotion absolutely everything from that day... today is two years after that happened and I'm still single, I think about that very often, and sometimes I can't believe that actually happened, it's like unreal. But I know it did, and I survived. I fucking survived. And I'm gonna keep on living because I deserve it. I look back and now I know I should've break up long before all that, but who can blame me? I was in love and manipulated. But I survived, I don't know if I will ever date again, or trust a man for that matter, but I will keep living and telling people my story. And I hope that nobody experience this, not one woman should experience this, I pray for all women across the world to be safe and take care and protect themselves from man like this. 🙏✝️","I survived I survived..

He would come on break in the middle of the night and cover me while I was sleeping with blanket, If I woke up he would ask me if I was hungry or thirsty or do I need anything. He was perfect. After couple of months something changed in him, it's like he started drinking,  acting possessive, wanted me to he with him 24/7, he wouldn't let me go home change my stuff or take some other clothes to wear, he would just wash it there and say "" I washed your clothes here they are clean you can wear them, no need to go home "" and I was like well I wanna wear something else, I don't wanna be always in the same clothes, and he always responded something like "" i don't care what you wear I love you the way you are, that doesn't matter to me "" . And he knew exactly how to melt my heart ( manipulate me ) so I didn't see how crazy all of that was, I was working at a place where he was constantly there checking up on me and then after work spend time with him and sleep at his place. After a week or two I really was little tired and wanted to have some me time so I can do skin care or something else, I just wanted to be little alone and at my home and I left, and every time I left he was acting like he misses me, he was texting me like he was depressed because I'm not there and I was like babe chill I just went home it's perfectly normal like we're gonna see each other tomorrow. But he kept saying stuff like that and somehow manipulated me to go back to his place or he will come to mine. I still loved me but It became too much for me to be constantly with him, I was feeling like I was trapped or in a cage cause I couldn't go anywhere or do anything. And as I started to go more home and distanced myself from him, he then started to put pressure on me that he wants us to get married, have kids start a family move in together and stuff, and I always said it's too early cause I was like 21 and he was 25 at the time, we were so young for that, I wasn't ready to start married life and have family. After a while he started drinking, like every day, he stopped sleeping, was always with his friend at bars drinking. I was always there for him cause I knew he has rough time, I just didn't know why and I just was there for him and waited for him to open up so I can help him, I didn't wanted to put any pressure on him. As the time went by, he was changing his behavior more and more and was drunk every day, he would get up and instead of breakfast he would just open a bottle of beer and started day with that and then continue till evening to drink. He was at the time still putting pressure on me, still was acting possessive and got jealous over nothing, he was paranoid and stuff, I didn't wanted to argue cause he was drunk all the time and I didn't wanted to make him mad cause I was scared of him. I was planning to slowly distance myself from him and eventually I would end the relationship. I wasn't feeling it anymore and person I fall for wasn't there anymore,  he was totally different and I didn't know who that person was and I just wanted to leave mostly because he was drinking too much. And I think he also knew that, he knew deep down. One day, our mutual friend was leaving the country and we wanted to meet all together and have couple of drinks and say goodbye. I was home getting ready and texting him all the time and just by vibes on texts it seemed like something was off. I called him and we spoke, and I asked him was he drinking today and he swore that he wasn't and that he had just like 1 beer, but I could tell he was drunk but decided to still meet with him cause I wanted to say goodbye to my friend and have some drinks myself. We meet later in a bar near our workplace and since he came I noticed he was waisted, I whispered to him and asked why he lied to me and he said he didn't and that he wasn't drunk at all, but he could barely talk normally. I was still little mad but I decided I'm not going to let him ruin my mood and was chilling. There were parents and two children from our mutual friend and that friend also and we were hanging and talking, and it was fun. At one point of the evening my boyfriend gave some money to the kids and started saying to me "" give them something, don't be like that, they are just little kids, how can you be like that "" and I was confused because I first off didn't do anything and I really didn't had money on me, I was always paying everything with card. And he knew that very well. Then he started putting money in my pockets and saying to me out loud like "" here you go, I'm gonna give you money since you don't have, just give it to the kids its nice thing to do "" and he kept saying that in way like I had something against the kids and I was very confused and asked him what is his problem, I told him I don't have anything against the kids and asked him to stop making me look bad in front of others. Then he started saying to me that I stop with my behavior, that I always ruin everything, he was asking me to be normal just this night and not to make drama or something, and that made me so mad cause I could tell he was ghosting me into thinking I'm the problem and like it's my fault and It never was. So I got up and said I'm gonna go home and then he pulled me from the table and told me to go, he threw my bag in front of me and shouted at me to leave, that I was this and this, so I picked my bag and I left. And guess what, he left right away with me, behind the bar he started yelling at me and I had enough at that point I was just like ""okay you're right, I'm just gonna go home we're over"". And then he hit me, he slapped me so hard and I remember at the moment that I couldn't believe that just happened, I remember just looking at him and  being completely shocked. I wanted to leave immediately but he started pulling me for my hair and hands and slapping me even more, and I was definitely making noise with every slap I got, but nobody did anything, nobody came to stop him. He started dragging me back to his place and I remember all the time he was telling me "" I'm gonna kill you when we get home. This is the last time you did this to me. I'm gonna kill you now I swear to Allah I am not afraid of anything I'm gonna kill you when we come home, you're dead "" and that scared me so much I sarted to pull and try to escape so badly but he kept hitting me and was stronger and bigger then me so I couldn't escpae. There were also some people passing on the street and only one them said something like ' leave the girl alone ' and he responded ' she's mine. I can do whatever I want with her' and that's it, nobody did anything,  everyone was just passing and looking like it was nothing going on while he was threatening me and hitting me on the street while I was trying to escape from him. We were close to his place and I knew that if I go up to that room I'm going to die, and I knew that I have to escape no matter what cause I don't wanna die, I kept thinking don't give up, if you go up there you're going to die, nobody can help you. When we came near the workplace, right in front of the stairs that led upstairs to his place I started pulling even more, I gathered every peace of strength I had and pulled away, he threw me on the ground and started strangling me right there on spot.. I remember it like it was yesterday.. I couldn't breathe, I felt so scared, like never before, I looked right at his eyes while he was strangling me and I didn't see anything, his eyes were empty, it looked like there was nobody behind them, like there's no person behind those eyes, pure emptiness. That scared me much more and while I was trying to defend myself and pulling his hands from my neck I kicked the pile of of boxes with empty bottles of drinks we served at restaurant and that made a huge noise. People from the garden ( the guests ) started looking around to see what happened and he saw that they are going to see him strangling me and as soon as felt he was distracted I pushed him and started yelling "" help he's trying to kill me! "" 
I couldn't yell loud cause I was trying at the same time to catch a breath but somehow I gathered strength to yell even louder every time cause I knew that was my only chance to escape this man. So the people heard me and came right away and I ran to them and started crying and shaking and I remember he was saying to them I was overreacting, that I was his girl and that I was drunk and he's just trying to get me home to bed and I was right away started yelling that he's lying and that he tried to kill me. People believed me cause I was covered in bruises, my hair was messy and half plucked. My coworker's at the time got me inside of restaurant and tried to calm me down and help me, they called the police and boss cause it happened inside of his property and I was just there.. Shaking, crying, I couldn't believe that actually happened, I couldn't believe that I could die, it all seemed like a horror movie.. They were all there asking me what happened, am I okay and I couldn't talk properly, I just fell into shock. After some time, police came and took me to hospital and I told them what happened. Later I found out he escaped right away from there and that police couldn't find him. My brother picked me up from hospital and took me home and stayed with me to watch for me in case he comes to my home and tries to hurt me. I was scared for my life. I kept thinking he's going to come back to finsih what he started, he's even more angrier now, he's going to find me and kill me. Day after I found out police arrested him, I also found out he got fired and left that place where he lived and went back to his country. Before that I heard from him once and saw him outside, he was sleeping on the street and benches and I offered him to come to my place to take a shower cause he was so dirty and looking really bad and I felt bad so I did the most stupid thing ever, and I did took him to my home but I first made a call to my roommates and neighborsso they know and can protect me if he tries anything. I washed his clothes, let him wash himself and warmed him enough and let him go, and I told him then this is the last time he sees me, and that I can't forgive or forget what he did to me, he apologized to me and told me he love me but I just couldn't forgive him for that so I escorted him out from my house and never saw him again after that. I also didn't press any charges, only the state sentenced him and deported him back to his country. And that's the end, after some time I got back on my job and started living normal life. But to this day I remember everything, every word, every emotion absolutely everything from that day... today is two years after that happened and I'm still single, I think about that very often, and sometimes I can't believe that actually happened, it's like unreal. But I know it did, and I survived. I fucking survived. And I'm gonna keep on living because I deserve it. I look back and now I know I should've break up long before all that, but who can blame me? I was in love and manipulated. But I survived, I don't know if I will ever date again, or trust a man for that matter, but I will keep living and telling people my story. And I hope that nobody experience this, not one woman should experience this, I pray for all women across the world to be safe and take care and protect themselves from man like this. 🙏✝️",1,"[('strangling me and as', 0.8850591778755188), ('hitting me on the', 0.8064558506011963), ('he tried to kill', 0.7412927746772766), ('trying to kill', 0.7675930857658386), ('and hitting me on', 0.7346121668815613), ('hitting me and', 0.9081107974052429), ('trying to kill me', 0.8747538924217224), ('was strangling me and', 0.8310390114784241), ('me and hitting', 0.8078199625015259), ('and started strangling me', 0.8043097853660583), ('strangling me and', 0.955170214176178), ('kept hitting me', 0.7519325017929077), ('he was strangling me', 0.7631040215492249), ('him strangling me and', 0.7390097379684448), ('him strangling me', 0.8287906050682068), ('hit me he', 0.816720187664032), ('strangling me right there', 0.9192520380020142), ('tried to kill', 0.8930404782295227), ('strangling me right', 0.9373188018798828), ('kill me \r\n', 0.7437477707862854), ('and hitting me', 0.7925859093666077), ('me and hitting me', 0.8664515614509583), ('strangling me and I', 0.9116796851158142), ('tried to kill me', 1.000000238418579), ('hitting me on', 0.7539110779762268), ('started strangling me', 0.880298912525177), ('started strangling me right', 0.8512111306190491), ('hitting me and was', 0.7546119689941406), ('was strangling me', 0.8746760487556458)]",1
Is any of this abusive? Why can't I leave?,"I have been with my boyfriend for 9 years and am deeply unhappy. I have been for a long time. This year I realized I've been in denial for years that there may be some abuse in my relationship. I am miserable and want to meet a husband and a long term partner who meets the same things. However, there are many things in the way. 1. I can't justify that any of this is actually abuse. I think I'm just being overdramatic. 2. I'm autistic (actually diagnosed) and change really disrupts my life. 3. My sister and I lost my Dad several years ago and I went through a miscarriage at the same time. I'm anticipating going through the same grief from if I breakup with my boyfriend and I just can't do it. 4. What if I regret it or it's the worst mistake I ever make?

Are any of these things abusive or reasons we shouldn't be together?

1.We're not sexually compatible at all. We've haven't any sexual contact of ANY kind in over 3 years now. I have vaginismus and vulvodynia which cause intense pain during sex, but he refuses to try new things at all and even refuses to modify penetration in certain ways to make it less painful. Says he doesn't ""know how."" He refuses to partake in any kind of foreplay. It eventually just became way too painful for me and I set a boundary. I want a healthy fun sexual relationship with someone. He doesn't know that I know he watches cam girls in the bathroom. 

2. When we were first together, he pressured me to drive into an empty office parking lot at night and give him a handjob. I remember being so uncomfy that I almost pushed my face against my window, but I never said no. He has since admitted over text that it was the worst thing he's ever done but that he was a stupid ""horny kid.""

3. I have PTSD from being sexually assaulted my a doctor (3 years into our relationship). At one point, my boyfriend said ""I can't believe you thinking more about this other man than me.""

  
4. I have a lot of medical issues and have had multiple surgeries including an emergency surgery while we've been together. He has never come, except for once, and that one time- I had to beg. Won't come to doctor appointments with me because ""I don't need him there.""

  
5. Gets mad at me when I talk about something more than once because it's ""illogical."" Things he has done included clapping his hands in my face and slamming my car door so hard he damaged it.

  
6. Wants my routine to revolve around him. He refuses to help with housework, even when I had spine surgery and even though I still have a bad spine and can't bend well. He won't help me clean hard to reach places and our apartment is in filth. Part of my stress is actually just the state of our apartment. He also won't pay someone to come help us clean it. He expects me to drive him to work at 11 at night even though he works literally 5 minutes away, because he doesn't drive, even though I work at 7am.  He enforces me doing chores by setting them up for me. Ie. he'll set out cat food and a bowl and remind me to do it, when he could have spent the same amount of energy just putting the food in the bowl and feeding our cat. He'll do this and remind me to feed her when I'm in bed at like 1 am.

7. He constantly gropes me. Like grabs my boobs. He doesn't listen to a word I say about anything and I feel invisible in my home. Then the minute I try to start a stimulating conversation with him he'll make silly faces and grabs my boobs. The one time I stood up for myself he got violent at objects near me and screamed at me and blamed it on my ADHD. Said he would stop and did for a while. Now he's doing it again. 

8. I want to get married. I want to feel like a princess for a day, and I feel like he thinks I don't deserve it.

"My boyfriend is very abusive, I need help.","I am a 23 year old female living in Pennsylvania living with my partner. We are renting a house and our lease ends in October 2025. It is only my name on the lease as he has bad rental history and credit.

My boyfriend has been escalating in his physical abuse, ranging from strangulation to now punching in head, arm, legs, back, and ribs. I know I am in danger of serious harm. He has even made threats to kill me. I know it isn't right, and I am ready to leave.

I know it won't be easy, and I do not want the police involved, even though I feel like that is inevitable, I do not want the police involved because:

1. I do not want to press any criminal charges
2. He is on probation, and I do not want him to get locked him (most likely if I get a protection order).
3. He said if I call the police he will kill me

I have already told my family and friends my decision on leaving (not the abuse of course, otherwise I know my mother would literally kill him). They offered to help me with his half of the rent, moving expenses, etc to come home. However, a part of me feels this is too much to ask as it'll be a lot of money.

Are there any alternatives to a protection order? Right now, I don't have a plan. I just want him out, but I'm afraid he will break another window, or follow through with his threats if I change the locks.

Here's some more context:

\- I work about 40 minutes from my house with a hybrid schedule, Mostly remote. However, I just started about 2 months ago so I do not want to abuse that privilege too much too soon.

\- I live about 4 hours away from my ""home."" So if I go ""home,"" I'm not sure how this job will work out, and I really really like and want to keep this job.

\- We just moved into this house in October. The landlord said before we signed the lease that if we break it and move out, we must pay 85% of the total rent for the remaining months (roughly $9,350). Even though I know my landlord is very reasonable and an understanding guy, I don't know if I'm able to tell him what is going on within his home. Yes, it'll get me out of the lease relatively easily, it feels too much, I can't explain it. On the other hand, my boyfriend has already broke a window that has yet to be repaired.

I am scared to get a protection order because I am afraid it'll make him worse. As of right now, I don't know what to do first, or how to go about anything. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

\- I work about 40 minutes from my house with a hybrid schedule, Mostly remote. However, I just started about 2 months ago so I do not want to abuse that privilege too much too soon.

\- I live about 4 hours away from my ""home."" So if I go ""home,"" I'm not sure how this job will work out, and I really really like and want to keep this job.

\- We just moved into this house in October. The landlord said before we signed the lease that if we break it and move out, we must pay 85% of the total rent for the remaining months (roughly $9,350). Even though I know my landlord is very reasonable and an understanding guy, I don't know if I'm able to tell him what is going on within his home. Yes, it'll get me out of the lease relatively easily, it feels too much, I can't explain it. On the other hand, my boyfriend has already broke a window that has yet to be repaired.

I am scared to get a protection order because I am afraid it'll make him worse. As of right now, I don't know what to do first, or how to go about anything. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

I Don’t Know What To Do,"Me F19 and my boyfriend M20 have been together for over a year now and I am getting more freaked out about what happened between us because of the Gabby Petito documentary released on Netflix. I notice a lot of similarities between the way we fight and used to. It used to be really scary between us where he would threaten my life, now he calls me names I.e. immature, childish, tells me that he only does things to me because of how I act out. He strangled me before when he was angry. We got in a fight and I poured his needles on the floor and threaten to call the cops (he is a bodybuilder) and he got angry and strangled me on the closet floor. I almost blacked out. I am scared he might hurt me again, I never feel safe when he gets angry. I have a lot of anxiety and he says I should trust him because he has gotten better and he doesn’t threaten me anymore. He strangled me a long time ago. It’s been months and our fights end with him slamming things but not hurting me. He can’t handle my emotions and thinks they are annoying and he gets mean and calls me names. I had a surgery today and I am in pain and I needed to rest and I brought up how I was watching the Gabby Petito documentary and it made me nervous and more scared because similar things happened and she ended up dead. He got angry and fought with me and made me cry for 45 minutes and said that he strangled me because I was escalating it and that he acts how he acts because I cry and scream. I cry and scream because he never leaves me alone and can’t stop scaring me with his words. I am not sure what to do because we have been better for months and we are building a life together. I just don’t know if I can ever trust him.  Sometimes when I cry I just need comfort and he cants stop defending himself and arguing with me, even when I just had surgery. I just wanted comfort about what happened in the past, I wanted him to say sorry and hug me and understand why it still affects me so much months later.. Please help me, I don’t have friends and I don’t have much going for me, we were building so much together.

feeling lost and need help,"I have been struggling in my marriage for years.  I think I know the next steps that I need to take, but I am scared to take them.  I don't know what to do next.  I am sorry, this is going to be really long.  I haven't really opened up about my situation to anyone, at least not the whole story.

My husband (46) and I (40) met in college when I was 22.  We dated and only a few months later I ended up pregnant with our first child.  If my current self could have talked to myself back then about waiting longer. (hindsight, right?).  When I was pregnant with our second I was invited to a birthday party for a good friend of mine (who happened to be a dude, and no, I was never interested in him as more than a friend, I firmly believe that opposite sexes can be platonic friends with each other), and my partner (we weren't married yet) forbid me from going to the birthday party to see a lot of my college friends.  When I insisted I was going to go anyway, because it is a free country and I will see my friends if I want to, he blocked the doorway so I couldn't leave.  When I tried to push past him, he hit me.  I hit him back and then he hit me again.  I should have walked away then.  But I didn't.  To this day, he insists that I am the one who raised my hand first.  It makes me feel crazy like I don't remember what actually happened that day.  

Over the years, my sexual libido has declined.  Things went from (pre-first baby) having sex at least once a day to (after first baby) a several times a week to (after second baby) twice a week.  None of this was every enough for him and he would complain and tell me that I was ignoring his needs and not doing enough.  We would set ""schedules"" that he agreed to, but I couldn't honestly hold to because it was just too much for me, so I was constantly not upholding my end of the bargain.  When I would try to point out that the frequency was too much, then I was told that I wasn't being considerate enough of his needs.  Fast forward - he graduated and we moved cross country.  I went through a big hormonal change and my libido completely disappeared, but I still tried to maintain once a week or once every other week in order to satisfy him.  At one point, he just decided to stop kissing me.  Up until that point, we would kiss romantically every day, before he left for work or when he would get home (or both).  He decided that since that daily kissing was not leading to daily sex that it was unnecessary and we weren't going to do that anymore.  If he couldn't get what he wanted, then I was not going to get what I wanted.  Our sexual/intimate/romantic relationship died from there on out.  Because we had young kids at home, it was very difficult for me to hold a job during the normal work week due to the high costs of childcare.  So I eventually started my own business and ran it completely online (NOT AN MLM).  

A year later, I quit my part-time retail job to focus on my business as it was proving to be quite successful.  Two years later I gave birth to my third child.  During all this time, I was consistently told that I didn't do enough for my husband romantically or sexually, I didn't keep our house clean enough, and the list went on.  When my work grew to be too overwhelming to accomplish what I needed to do ""during the workday"" I began to continue working on it during the evening and early night hours.  Mind you, I had young children and an infant home with me during the day, so I did NOT have a ton of ""free time"" as I was taking care of their needs.  My husband began to berate me for all the time that I put into my business that wasn't ""really a business"".  

One time.  We had friends coming to visit and after I had spent 24 hours cleaning our house from top to bottom, all I had left to do was clean up and organize my work desk.  He was in a mood and he threw everything off my work desk onto the floor - including my desktop computer.  I was in tears.  He trashed the living room and told me everything was my fault because I cared more about my business than about him, our family, or making things presentable for our guests.   I threw myself into my business even more to show him that I was doing something good for all of us.  I even took on help and was able to make the income I needed to justify paying for childcare out of my business paycheck to myself.  It was never good enough.

  
We moved again and shortly after the pandemic happened.  I went through a couple of years with a lot of health problems.  During this time, my husband had a complaint about one of our children and I stood up to him.  It resulted in my husband smashing all of my house plants on the floor of our kitchen and dining room.  Our kids witnessed the whole thing.  He felt bad and replaced the pots and some of the plants and had a long talk with the kids about how you can't behave the way they just saw.  He has not damaged anything since that day, but instead, when he is angry, he will follow me from room to room when I try to make space from him to avoid a blow up fight that could turn physical.  He will wake me up out of a dead sleep to tell me all the things I am not doing good enough.  

A couple of years ago, I took my kids back home to visit with family.  It was a nice long visit and I came back to my home refreshed and rejuvenated and ready to work on the cracks in my marriage.  We had very nice sex and things seemed to be going good.  Then one day shortly after, he explodes in anger because I used the credit card to put gas and food on it during the travel back home (I drove 2400 miles away).  I was then accused of using sex as a weapon.

I have honestly just reached a point where I am stressed out when he is home.  I am always on edge because I never know if it will be a good day or a bad day.  We haven't had sex in almost a year, in 2 years we have only had sex two times.  I cannot get to that point sexually with him.  I feel vulnerable and exposed.  With the lack of trust, I just can't keep doing it.  It used to be one week a month I was told how I didn't do enough, I wasn't intimate enough, I wasn't present enough, I didn't make enough money, etc, etc.

I slowed my business way down in order to have more time to spend with my family.  I have struggled picking up part-time jobs because not a single one is flexible with my kids' school schedules.  They all want you to work until 4pm or start at 4pm, which would leave my youngest kids home alone for 1-2 hours.  I just can't do it, and can't find childcare for such a short time on randomly scheduled days.  

My husband and I talked about the financial part and we agreed it would be good for me to go back to school and finish my degree.  So I did.  I will finally graduate this May.  The last two years have been the literal worst two years of my married life so far.  The berating for not being present enough, being told constantly that I am selfish for not spending more time with my kids or him.  The list goes on.  

Well, over the holidays, he was upset about how much money I spent between Halloween/Thanksgiving/Christmas, so he took away all the bankcards, credit card and debit card.  He accused me of running the credit card up (this balance was added to mutually).  When I tried to ask for a print out of all the transactions, he refused to print it out.  Told me that I didn't need to see it and neither did he.  So there was no way for me to confirm if/by how much I may have overspent.  I am not super financially savvy, but I am not a big-spender either.  I do my best to spend within my means and pay debt down.  He left me completely without access to money so I have been unable to pay my son's dental bill one day or my own medical copays for doctor visits. Or even put gas in the vehicles.

Thanks to contributions from my family, I went to visit my sister over the holidays and had a wonderful time.  When I came home, I had decided that I wanted to go for grad school and get a masters degree.  One of my professor's in my class this semester invited me to do an independent study project, it would be really helpful for me to show what I am capable of.  When I talked to my husband about these ideas and about my future goals - he was shocked.  Shocked in anger that is.  I was told that I was wasting his time, my kids time, and my parents time by pursuing those things.  That I am way too old to be starting any of that now and I need to just get a job and start making money and getting ready to retire.  That whomever I have been talking to about these ideas is giving me bad information and I shouldn't take anything they say seriously.  That I would be a fool to go down this path because it will take too long and I will ruin my children's lives while they are still home.  I have spent the last 18 years of my life supporting him, his education (early on), and all of his career goals/decisions, and this is what happens when I try to stretch my own wings to fly?

I want to divorce.  But my daughter is going to start her last year of high school this fall, and I just can't bring myself to go through a divorce and potentially ruin what she has been calling her ""golden year"" for the last few months.  She has all these big ideas and dreams of what she wants to do and accomplish her senior year.  If I divorce my husband now, I would move closer to family, which would pull her out of her school and away from her friends.  Or I would leave her here and not get to share her senior year with her.  Neither is acceptable to me.  Am I making the right choice here?  Or am I just over reacting?  Are all husbands this way?  Is he actually being abusive in some way or am I just exaggerating it in my own head?  What do I do from here?","feeling lost and need help I have been struggling in my marriage for years.

My Abusive Ex-Husband Has a Parole Hearing,"My ex-husband, who was sentenced to prison for domestic violence against me, has a parole hearing coming up. They’ve asked me to write a victim impact statement, and I’m feeling… conflicted.

Part of me really hopes he’s changed. He had a severe drug problem, and while that doesn’t excuse what he did, it was a huge factor in his violence. When he was using, he was paranoid, angry, and unpredictable. He strangled me multiple times. He broke my nose, my foot, and tried to break my arm. The last time he was arrested, he had stolen my car, and when I found it, it had meth, needles, and spoons inside. I’ve done a lot of work to move forward, and I truly hope that prison has given him the space to get clean and become a better person.

But the other part of me—the part that lived through it—worries that he hasn’t changed. Even after he was incarcerated, he called me 20 times a day, even when I wasn’t answering. That obsessive, can’t-let-go behavior is what scares me the most. If he gets out and relapses, I’m terrified he’ll fixate on me again. And the thing is, I know how his mind worked back then. If he convinced himself that if he couldn’t have me, no one could… well, that’s a possibility I can’t ignore. I have a family now. A husband. A baby. And the idea of him coming back into my life in any capacity makes my skin crawl.

I guess I’m struggling with what to say. I don’t want to be vindictive. I don’t want to assume he hasn’t changed. But I also have to be honest about the very real danger he posed to me—and could pose again. I know the parole board isn’t looking for my personal feelings, just the facts. And the facts are that I barely made it out of that relationship alive.

Has anyone else been in this position? How did you handle it? I feel like I have a responsibility to protect myself, but I also don’t want to live in fear forever.","My Abusive Ex-Husband Has a Parole Hearing My ex-husband, who was sentenced to prison for domestic violence against me, has a parole hearing coming up.

I went back to him and immediately it escalated to physical violence,"**It all started with him putting me down a lot, insulting me, and messing with my head.** He’d make weird ""jokes"" like saying he’d drown me in the sea if I pissed him off, which freaked me out. 

**Then things started getting physical.** During an argument, he spat at me, and later on, he coerced me into sex when I didn’t want to, pulling me back when I tried to leave. I broke up with him.

He reached out after a month, we got back together. After that, things just escalated even faster, within 2 days.

**The cycle between the good and bad moments got shorter.** One day, he was being nice, and literally two days later, he grabbed my jaw and shoved me to the ground during another ridicolous argument. 

During this argument, he made a threatening move by shifting his leg towards my neck, like he was going to pin my head down with it. I managed to pull away.

I ended up locking myself in my room after that, and he wouldn’t leave for an hour, even though I kept texting him to go. He even took my phone at one point and dared me to call the police.

I broke up with him for good. It hurts a lot.

I sign my lease tomorrow,"A year ago I decided to leave a toxic, emotionally abusive relationship of 7 years with my 7 year old daughter. 

I left one bad relationship because I was desperate to escape and blinded by the soon-to-be worse situation. 

A coworker convinced me to leave, I was love bombed and fell for it in my vulnerable state. The initial breakup was horrible and I had everything I owned stolen from me by my ex partially due to the new guy pressuring me to ""choose"" because I would return home where my ex still lived, though we had broken up, neither of us had means to completely separate immediately. 

Because I essentially had nothing, I became dependant on the new guy for means of a functional home, this all happened a couple weeks before the pandemic hit our country and province went into full blown lock down. The provinces closed up borders, which separated me even more from my support system, my family lived a mere two minute drive away... Just outside the border

There were red flags from the start, but I was so isolated due to my job being on the opposite side of the border, the country in panic, the province closed everything down, having very little possessions, I grinned and bared whatever hoping that it'll get better.

Turns out that he's a major alcoholic. Withdrawal syndrome if he hasn't drank in 14 hours, shakes, nausea, panic attacks, etc. 
About 4 months in, I tried to explain how out of control his drinking was, and that set off a bomb, he flipped the couch I was sitting on, so I hit the wall it was pushed up against, a blanket underneath me, he yanked out, so I again hit the floor, while curled up he threw large clay flower pots at me. My daughter waking up and seeing this. 

I try to tuck her back in, doing my best to keep her out of his sight because I wasn't sure what he was like, this was the first I experienced. 

She wouldn't let me leave her alone, she was scared, but I knew I had to because I was the target and she wasn't safe near me. 

However I held her as she trumble beneath me, I had her lie down with her face into the bed, worried if he heard her crying, it would draw attention to her. 

It lasted hours, several things broken. 

Since then, there was at least 4 other violent incidents. Each time, I disassociated quicker, not giving him the reaction he wanted, he pushed further. I started to record the audio, I took pictures of the bruises or damage. 

The worst incident though, he just broke his toe from kicking the door, thinking I left it cracked when I walked away from him trying to fight.

A problem I always had was the backdoor had a two way deadbolt lock, so only he could unlock it. My daughter's bedroom closest to that door, if there was a fire that prevented her from reaching the front door, she would be trapped. 
He knew that was an anxiety for me, so after breaking his toe, standing in the hallway between my daughter's room and the front door where I was, he lights a rubber table runner on fire, throws it to the ground, basically threatening my kid's life.

She woke up at the same time, so he immediately snuffed out the fire, and stopped. 

I walked outside knowing he wouldn't continue to fight where neighbors would definitely see. 
He locks me out and says now, he's really going to burn the place down. I calmly say ""I'm calling 911."" 
Obviously, opens the door, goes to bed all innocently like I imagined it all. 

Since being violent didn't work, he began routinely calling the cops on me, trying to give them the impression that if I were to go to the cops with my evidence, he appears like the calm one, as if trying to beat me to it. He probably called the cops on me 8 times in the last 6 months. 

The last few times, they told me essentially they know his mental state has gone downhill and that I never did anything. 

All this long post to say, after months of trying to leave, I sign my lease for a place tomorrow.

Trapped with no money to leave fast. Strangled two days ago.,"Hear me out I know it’s long. I’m in a bad relationship, it’s been toxic & he has put hands on me (choked me out 3+ years ago (5years together)) i felt like he knew if he crossed it ever again, it would be the end. Well he’s been hostile with me for months. Dirty looks emotionally draining me & our daughter (3y) gets it too since he does it in front of her. I’ve stayed cause I’m scared what would happen if I leave, plus I do love him & beg for change. he gets violent when I ask him to leave, or if I talk about how to fix ya, he breaks things, yells & gets in my face. But Nothing that made me frightened for my life, until, two days ago he snapped. He first hit me & my daughter with a silk long pillow hard, knocks my head onto hers hard. We were cuddled about to sleep my daughter & I. Then he gets her (picks her up) , she wanted me, I get her back after begging & told him to go or I was calling the cops. He moved or tossed her off of me onto my legs, it was fast- then choked me with one hand & plugged my nose & mouth with the other. He stopped but I seen black, almost fainted maybe? I don’t remember it all happened so fast. We are here with him until he goes to work Tuesday, we’re acting cool like nothing happened & so is he. But I only have $122 & I don’t have breaks or Ac in car & might need a rotor before I can go. That will break me or might not be enough. But I think if I have a friend help who won’t charge much- we can make $122 work to Fix it. I need gas to get to either North Carolina to his family who knows everything & will protect me while helping him (he won’t know I’m out of our state) or I can go to Florida to my sister & her gram. I just need to pay to get there. Food for Ride, gas & a hotel for a night maybe two depending on where I choose to go. I can’t knock it out in a day being the only driver. I don’t know how I can get money, $, to leave by Tuesday when that’s my only day I can leave in secrecy. Any help to make fast cash will be appreciated & repaid when I’m on my feet, please no scams. I don’t want to post all my proof here that includes last names of my family. I’ll scratch last names out of photos. But this is all my life. I wish I was lying. I love him, he is only here for our daughter he does nothing for besides traumatize her. She’s scared of loud noises & it’s cause of him. 
Ps getting pfa morning before I leave, I pray i can Tuesday... pray for us please. He takes my phone sometimes when he senses something. So here’s to making it to Tuesday with a phone & money to leave before he snaps again & doesn’t stop.

Massachusetts domestic violence rights,"I've been in a domestic violence relationship off on 20 years been itleast 10 years now living in his house.

I've had the hardest life and want to give up at 52 because l've never felt more like a looser. I| raised myself and my 33yr old son so why now did I let someone put me in the worst situation I've always had options but why do I have to give him what he wants I have for 20 years and tonight said I love you so much and would try anything please go to couples therapy his exact words"" \*uck you"" he treats me like I'm the problem he says he loves me because he buys everything. I don't want anything except to be loved half the way I give love but at 52 gave up that I just dont want to feel worse about myself than I already do. I'm tiered of beating myself up. Feeling he holds all the cards because I'm broke and have NEVER HAD FAMILY OR EVEN A TRUE FRIEND. DO I HAVE TO LEAVE AND GO TO A SHELTER OR CAN HE GO TILL I GET MY FINANCES OR A PLACE TO GO? I'd rather sleep in a car if I had one than go to a shelter at 52

he treats me the way I would never treat any person or even animal. He justifies everything always my fault he says he’s miserable and it’s all my fault and refuses to give a valid reason his reason is I don’t shut up or I raise my voice. I wish he was like that so why do I feel bad or guilt? He’s so vindictive him kicking me out every other day calling me \*unt. Laughing that I have no one and no where to go. I’ve always been messed up but I know 100% I’m the most caring understanding person but it screws me every time. I’m called a \*unt enough but CANT be one no matter what. I feel guilt when he feels 0 guilt or remorse it’s about him. he has to jerk off because he can’t show me ANY RESPECT it’s always poor him not oh Kathy you’ve had the worst life let me just support you mentally and be there NO. Keeps making me feel worse than I ever thought I could. WHY HAVE I GAVE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE MY WHOLE LIFE BUT AT 52 HAVE NEVER EVER FELT IT. IVE  HAD THE WORD LOVE THROWN AROUND SO MUCH AND ALWAYS GIVE IT SO WHY OR IS IT REALLY OBTAINABLE? I want nothing and never had except unconditional love why why why don’t I deserve it? What is wrong with me why 20 years mental abuse now that I truly have nothing and want to leave I can’t why does he get to kick me out and laugh and I still care for him even though he’s the only person in the world that’s made me feel hate. I hate he’s made me such a miserable angry person. Can’t we all just love one another. Why is res so easy to give and impossible for me to obtain?

I said just buy me a $3000 car I’ll leave now. He laughed in my face saying yea right I think I deserve it. I just know NO ONE DESERVES TO BE REPEATEDLY TREATED LIKE THIS AND MADE FEEL LIKE IM THE WORSE DISGUSTING PERSON IN THE WORLD. IVE NEVER LIED CHEATED OR ABUSED ANYONE SO HOW DO I DESERVE THIS CAN I JUST FEEL LOVE NOT JUST A MAN LOVE FROM A FRIEND. MAYBE I AM UNLOVABLE 😢","Massachusetts domestic violence rights I've been in a domestic violence relationship off on 20 years been itleast 10 years now living in his house. I stopped paying him a few years ago but haven't been able to save to leave. He owns house brand new vehicle but demands on itleast a weekly basis to put it nice ""leave"" I'm the reason for his misery at 52 years old I can't keep being his punching bag and questioning my sanity. I've had the hardest life and want to give up at 52 because l've never felt more like a looser. I| raised myself and my 33yr old son so why now did I let someone put me in the worst situation I've always had options but why do I have to give him what he wants I have for 20 years and tonight said I love you so much and would try anything please go to couples therapy his exact words"" \*uck you"" he treats me like I'm the problem he says he loves me because he buys everything. I don't want anything except to be loved half the way I give love but at 52 gave up that I just dont want to feel worse about myself than I already do. I'm tiered of beating myself up. Feeling he holds all the cards because I'm broke and have NEVER HAD FAMILY OR EVEN A TRUE FRIEND. DO I HAVE TO LEAVE AND GO TO A SHELTER OR CAN HE GO TILL I GET MY FINANCES OR A PLACE TO GO? I'd rather sleep in a car if I had one than go to a shelter at 52

he treats me the way I would never treat any person or even animal. He justifies everything always my fault he says he’s miserable and it’s all my fault and refuses to give a valid reason his reason is I don’t shut up or I raise my voice. I wish he was like that so why do I feel bad or guilt? He’s so vindictive him kicking me out every other day calling me \*unt. Laughing that I have no one and no where to go. I’ve always been messed up but I know 100% I’m the most caring understanding person but it screws me every time. I’m called a \*unt enough but CANT be one no matter what. I feel guilt when he feels 0 guilt or remorse it’s about him. he has to jerk off because he can’t show me ANY RESPECT it’s always poor him not oh Kathy you’ve had the worst life let me just support you mentally and be there NO. Keeps making me feel worse than I ever thought I could. WHY HAVE I GAVE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE MY WHOLE LIFE BUT AT 52 HAVE NEVER EVER FELT IT. IVE  HAD THE WORD LOVE THROWN AROUND SO MUCH AND ALWAYS GIVE IT SO WHY OR IS IT REALLY OBTAINABLE? I want nothing and never had except unconditional love why why why don’t I deserve it? What is wrong with me why 20 years mental abuse now that I truly have nothing and want to leave I can’t why does he get to kick me out and laugh and I still care for him even though he’s the only person in the world that’s made me feel hate. I hate he’s made me such a miserable angry person. Can’t we all just love one another. Why is res so easy to give and impossible for me to obtain?

My husband almost killed me,"I don’t have a lot of people to talk to so I thought I could just get these thoughts out of my head. I married my husband after 4 years of being together. He’s a good man, he would treat me like a princess 98% of the time and that 2% he would be angry during an argument and break things, sometimes even hitting me or handling me roughly. I grew up in a house like that (my mom) so I thought it was normal. A year into our marriage he hit me for the first time, he later found God and he changed, he was so patient and kind, even when he was upset. A year later we had a baby, and during this time our arguments escalated, and he’d break more things, pull my hair, and demand respect from me. I changed as a woman when I married him,  I became the perfect housewife, I made our house a home, kept it so tidy, learned to cook from scratch, and so much more. 2 weeks ago he got angry and went to hurt himself, while trying to stop him he strangled me and told me he was going to kill me. And I think I’m still in shock. He was arrested. And I feel this mixture of guilt, betrayal, anger, and heartache. I don’t understand this pain, and I don’t want to feel it anymore. I’m sorry, I’m ranting I don’t really care if anyone reads this or responds, I just need to know that I am saying it out loud. He almost killed me, but I survived. I fought to survive. And I lived. I wonder what goes on in his head, I wonder if he feels guilty, or if he is angry and blames me. (Please don’t come for me this is really fresh and I have an appointment with a therapist who specializes in DV and PTSD)

"DV survivor, now married w/ one child","I hope someone has some advice. 

NOTE: I go to therapy weekly (in the past long term biweekly was a thing for 9+ months), I’ve been seeing my therapist for 6 years. Rarely missing an appointment. I also do A.R.T therapy with my therapist. Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) — an eye-movement therapy designed to decrease the emotional reactivity and distressing symptoms experienced following stressful or traumatic events.

Anyways, I left my DV situation (physical, mental, and emotional) in April of 2018- (which was for about 2.5 years) In January of 2019 I met my now husband. Married in mid 2020. Now we have one child together. 

In therapy, I work on processing through my trauma and trying to get back the person i once was before my trauma from the guy I was with. I know I will never be the same, but I can try to get her back the best I can. 

I have always struggled with letting my guard down with my husband. I only want my pets/therapist when I get into a depressive episode, flashback, panic attack or any type of intense feelings/thoughts/memories. Through therapy we discovered that this is because the intensity of my trauma and through my ART therapy I will let him back in. Even though in my head I know my husband is such a safe person and loving man. The trauma still lives within and I can’t let him in to help because it makes me feel vulnerable again. I try so hard to not feel vulnerable with him because of how vulnerable I was in my DV situation. 

I want my husband to see me vulnerable and to help me when I am. My therapist says it’s going to take more time. But I am just posting here in hopes someone has been through something similar and has some advice. Thank you for taking the time to read.

I’m just so tired. I know he’s not as abusive as many but this is slowly killing me. AIO or AITA?," AITA for thinking my (39F) husband (42M) is being selfish and childish?

A little backstory:
I was up all night (til 7am) like I am often because we have puppies and senior dogs that need frequent potty breaks and attention. I also have schoolwork to do and chores and maybe even a little me time that I can’t get during the day because my husband is always there and has high demands of my time. 
He works 530am to 4pm and wants dinner at 4 everyday. Then he usually falls asleep by like 6pm and wakes up around 12-3 am. I’m expected to make sure he has food and be up to let him hang out with the dogs and etc. 
We live in a house with my mom and sis, and he stays exclusively in his office or our room. He has a micro and fridge and etc. in his office and I keep him stocked up on food. (Soup. Sandwiches. Cereal. Oatmeal. Burritos. Yogurt. Water. Coffee. Drinks. Etc.)
Because he needs to sleep and the dogs are not prone to follow his schedule of sleep, I’m up u til he wakes up in the am and then usually have to make him food and etc. then I get to sleep. 
Last night I got to sleep at 7am. He was sleeping on my pillow and blanket and sprawled across our king size bed and I couldn’t even sit down. I tried to wake him enough for him to move but he didn’t. 

I explained all of this to him when I woke up at TEN AM. For my religious meeting. Afterward I made him some food and etc but I was SO tired. I have health issues and the stress is killing me. When I woke up 2pm he was pissed at me (it’s his day off and he was playing video games. )
 
So I cried and slept alone for about an hour then I went to Panera to study and get out the house (which he had told me I should do before he got mad at me)

Steps to being alone from a domestic violence relationship ,"I’ve asked him to leave my house. He wants to wait until his next payment from school. I so want to call the school (college) and say please push it through fast because I will finally be free and out of this DV situation. It helps to get everyone’s insights and advice on this. I have no money, no job, I am in school full time (continuing education) and have four kids with him. My other two are older and with their dad. I can’t see how or what my next steps are after he leaves. I’m waiting on money from My school too and maybe will be here next week. I receive food benefits because he refuses to spend his money on actual food from the store. He will gladly buy one large pizza for all of us and that is not enough. In order to keep him happy I had to do a series of things that are inappropriate and just wrong. We go without trash bags and toilet paper for weeks and he doesn’t think to get it. Yet I have to find ways to use Walmart bags for our trash making me look stupid in front of neighbors. We have wipes so that takes care of the tp part. If I make food and leave him a plate he won’t eat it he will make something for himself. 

What I want to know is what do I do? I have a home 2/3 bedroom and one bath. I have always just rent it out for income until get back on my feet. Instead I just want to sell it. Problem I am not only one on the deed (my family) they don’t want to sell. I live in Texas and it is hard to find an affordable house to rent or apt. My house has some small repairs needed. That too is expensive. I don’t know what to do. 

On side note: my health has been questioned as now I cannot see properly blurry vision and went to Dr and we got things in order but might be something neurological in worst case scenario. 
Please help with some steps. Keep in mind that I don’t have a whole lot of money and I need to get kids clothes shoes and backpacks for school.

is this considered abuse? (im a teenager),"hi, im a teenager and i created a burner just for this so that he can't find it or something.  there have been a couple instances where my dad ( twice my size) has hurt me; but i know he loves me yet has never said sorry. he yells a LOT and will threaten to hurt me and my younger brother sometimes but never carries them out and will also threaten to break stuff like our phones or other electronics (he's been doing so since i was really little).

there was an instance where he shoved 7 year old me into a wall when my mom wasn't home because i wouldn't brush my teeth. more recently, last winter, he dragged me off my bed by my hair, then kicked me when i fell onto the floor because i wanted to finish my homework before showering. i did cry and told him to stop because it truly did hurt, especially because when i was kicked my head hit the leg of a chair in my room.
 
im not sure if this is considered serious abuse or something that puts me in danger. i've told my mom yet she won't do anything, so i've come to reddit for this question 🤷‍♀️
there have been also MANY instances where he'll insult me/bring me down if i do small things he doesn't agree with, and will belittle me and call me names. stuff like insulting my weight, what i look like, saying i have no friends because of xxx, stuff like that. and i admit that it makes me afraid to do anything that makes me stand out in front of him. i doubt he'll hurt me again but im afraid to tell anyone incase he gets mad

i doubt he means to hurt me and im pretty sure his parents treated him the same way when he was a child. i know he truly does love me, but i also know that he shouldn't threaten to smack me when i make a snide comment","is this considered abuse?

I need help.  I don't know what to do. ,"Hi everyone, I am trying to Reddit out of desperation. I apologize but I am going to give some context before I get to the issue.  I have been separated from my abuser for two years now. We have split custody of our daughter. I have spent this time in therapy working through all the brain washing I endured during my marriage and come to accept the abuse that occurred. My therapist specializes in cases like these. She also has worked closely with children in these cases. At one point I brought up concerns that my ex is SA our daughter. My therapist walked me through everything, from what questions to ask her and how to go about calling cops and cps. But they closed the case. I was painted as the crazy ex wife who is going nuclear and framing a good man. I sought out legal help and the lawyer said if I continue to press this matter I will lose my daughter. I have spent the past year sitting with the guilt of having my hands tied and not being able to help my daughter without the risk of losing her. I have been too afraid to talk to anyone about it in therapy because I know she will have to file a report and again risk losing my baby. I have been shown no one will believe me. My own family didn't believe me when I came to tell them about how he abused me. Okay now onto the issue at hand. Tonight before bed my daughter picked out one of the many books I bought that teach about SA awareness and safety in a kid appropriate way. This is the first time she picked this book out since a year ago when we went through the whole investigation. As I read her the book I am checking in with her, asking questions to make sure she understands what is going on in the story like I always do. This book in particular even gives prompt questions to ask. The answer she gave are very concerning to say the absolute least. I don't know what to do. The last time I went through all the right channels they just brushed it off because of my mental health, cannabis and alcohol use history. I am scared the same thing will happen or worse I will lose her alltogegher. Please, I'm begging. What can I do?","I need help.  I don't know what to do.

How to help friend in an abusive marriage,"I have a friend that is in an abusive marriage. She is a stay at home mom to their two young children so has no income of her own. She is estranged from almost all of her family, and all of her relatives/friends live out of state. What pisses me off the most is that CPS has been involved with their family, but have not done anything because the kids are not being physically abused. They just made the husband (and my friend) go to therapy which has not helped. The husband has hit my friend/kicked her in the ribs, and is apparently still threatening to beat her regularly. CPS actually called me because she gave them my phone number as someone they could interview since she has no other close relationships here. I straight up told them that the husband is dangerous and my friend has no way to get out without financial support. They still have not helped her find any resources.

I have encouraged her to leave even if it meant going to a shelter. I have encouraged her to get a job to start squirreling away some money to leave, but she says she can’t afford childcare and any government assistance in that department takes too long to get. Plus the husband would just take any money she made if he knew she had a job. She claims that any of the local domestic violence resources have not been helpful. I understand that she feels very stuck in her situation but to be honest I think she hasn’t put much effort into making anything better for herself either.

I wish that I could offer her and her kids a place to stay temporarily but it’s just not a possibility. I know most people will probably say that all I can do is be there to listen/support her, but I’m hoping that someone might have some other suggestions. I’m going to see her today. I don’t see her often because she lives about an hour drive away and I have my own small child. The husband will not be home. I plan to give her some pepper spray and $500 cash, explaining that I want her to hold onto it and only spend it on gas to get away from him when the day comes where she inevitably has to run for her life. Is there anything else I can do to help my friend? We are in Michigan. ","How to help friend in an abusive marriage I have a friend that is in an abusive marriage.

If my mom is abusing is that domestic violence?,"I hate how I am constantly having to beg and plead people to take her abuse seriously. Nobody believes me when I say I have been forced to stay inside of a room with basically only a phone iPad and computer for 10 years. And before that my life was very similar. 

She shows all the traits of an abusive controlling jealous and angry partner including not letting me work or have relationships with people.

Everything I do is met with punishment. 

No one understands. And it making me sour to people. 

Police blatantly ignore this. And so does the NDVH or the Hotline. I sent help texts out a month and a half ago and they sent an APS lady to be nice to my face and then angry and abusive over messages. This aggravated my abuser when I gave them my phone and told them please don’t come here you’ll put me in danger. Police disregarded that for their fucking investigation. They have no regard to what she’ll do to me. I can’t take it anymore. 

This is the only way I can contact people and they blocked it. 
So she’ll emotionally abuse me until I die. 

They want to force me onto government benefits which I do not want because then I will never be able to work outside of the country in my field. I’d rather take my life than not to be able to work.

For over a year I have been dating this girl who is a survivors of three years worth of physical and emotional abuse. She has two kids with two separate men aged 2 and 5. The 2 year old is the son of her abuser who has not had contact with him in over a year. She ended the relationship with her abuser January 2023 and still lived with him because of their kid. Throughout the relationship he stalked her and controlled who she spoke to and treated her like an object. April of 2023 he assaulted her in the home and a NCO was put in place. In June of 2023 we went on our first date and that night when she got home, he broke into her home and assaulted her again. Since then all trials dates have been delayed and custody hearing have been delayed which has put stress on her. Everytime a trial date was near she would become emotionally distant but would recover once it’s passed. In March if this year the alleged final trial date was set and so again she became distant but this trial was move again to June which he plead guilty in open court to 8 felonies and sentencing was put back till August. Since the March date she has been distant with me and says it’s due to the stress of not knowing what will happen with the sentencing and custody stuff.

Enough context, she is now saying that we need to break up so she can heal. She said she has been healing from the abuse but thinks that her feeling this way for the past few months is due to the abuse and we need to seperate for her to heal. She really does not want to break up but steels like this is a necessary step. I pointed out to her that I don’t think us breaking up will fix anything and that she needs therapy as her issues are internal
And not with me and only appeared when court came into play. I told her to at least try therapy before we break up which she agreed to. I know that she is stressed and hurting and needs to heal and I know she is acting like this because of all the upcoming court dates. How can I help her heal? I assured her I will always be there for her no matter how long it takes. Even called of our wedding so she can have as much time as she needs to heal.

We spend all of our time together and I mean that, even when she is feeling this way she wants to be around me. I just want to help her. Also have other posts about her story on my account if you want further context.","How to assist my girlfriend who is a survivor? Hello,

Judge refused a temporary Order of Protection,"I am so heartbroken and scared.

Today I went to family court to file an OOP petition that I prepared with the local DV shelter. I just signed it, dropped it off, and a judge would look at it at some point either today or tomorrow and make a determination. My petition included details of physical/sexual/financial/psychological abuse by my soon-to-be-ex husband that has escalated over the past few years and months. He showed up at my place unannounced and acting manic just over a week ago and I had to call the police, which finally scared me enough to pull the trigger on an OOP.

Both my therapist (who also works as a DV support in court), the DV shelter, as well as the clerk that helped me file the petition were all in agreement that it was likely I would AT LEAST get a temporary order.

Just found out this evening that the judge refused to issue a temporary order of protection, and issued a court date 2 WEEKS AWAY. Either already tonight or tomorrow, my spouse will receive his court summons which includes an entire copy of my petition, where I call out his abusive behavior. This will make him beyond angry, and will give him ample opportunity to hide his firearms and other weapons before court in case an order is granted afterwards. My best guess is that the judge thinks I'm being vindictive because my husband is the plaintiff in our divorce, and the OOP was filed after I was served papers.

So for the next two weeks and likely long after, I get to live in absolute terror that I just poked the bear. That the man that has already been abusive to me, has nothing deterring him to abuse me further. And my hopes of an OOP are completely crushed; if a judge didn't deem it necessary to grant a temporary one based off my petition, as brutal as it was, why would he decide to make one permanent?

I am disgusted by this judge and my county. They would rather protect an abuser's temporary rights than protect a victim and potentially save a life.

My divorce lawyer has already agreed to represent me for our court date. Any advice or hugs welcome.","Judge refused a temporary Order of Protection I am so heartbroken and scared.
