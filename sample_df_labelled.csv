I'm not happy but I'm scared of leaving,"Hello,

I have been in a relationship for five years with a man, but we have known each other for longer. It wasn’t the healthiest relationship at the beginning (cheating and lies on his part). But I always let it slide due to my emotional dependency. Today, I am sure he is no longer cheating on me.

However, he has a serious problem with alcohol, and he often becomes violent—mostly verbally, but once physically. He often threatens to hit me (but doesn’t do it), punches walls, and screams. One time, he tried to strangle me to scare me because I ""wouldn’t shut up""... But when he doesn’t drink, he’s not like that.

The problem is that now that I’ve opened my eyes to my emotional dependency, I can no longer ignore it. On top of that, I’m struggling financially and can’t find a job. I can’t leave him because I’m afraid of ending up on the street. Also, my family loves him. But most of all, I still love him, and I don’t know what to do...

We have plans to get married and have children. But I’m afraid I will never know what happiness is. I have never felt truly happy... I don’t think happiness is meant for me.

I don’t know what to do. I feel lost. Do you have any advice? I have no one to talk to...

My mom called my abuser a 'poor baby boy',"Almost two weeks ago, I fled my home after my bofriend of 7 years threatened to kill me. I took my dogs and left behind pretty much everything else I owned. I spent more than a week in hiding, afraid to go outside or even open the curtains. 

I have talked to my mom several times since I left, and almost every time, she's made me feel even worse. Yesterday she called me to check-in, and ended up calling my abuser a 'poor baby boy'. The man that had spent 7 years screaming that I was a worthless, stupid cunt. The man that spent 7 years insisting that I needed to meet his every emotional need, and I wasn't allowed to share my feelings. The man that detroyed my belongings, threw things at me, and then told me it was my fault because I hurt his feelings. The man that literally THREATENED TO KILL ME. 

He gets my house, my furniture, my cats, and most of the stuff in my home. I am currently staying in a bedroom so small that it doesn't fit anything besides the bed. I I'm losing most of what I owned, including my home and car. His family can probably afford a lawyer to fuck me out of all of the equity in our home. I have to start over completely, and somehow she still makes me feel bad, and makes him out to be the victim. 

While going through old messages, collecting documentation for an OFP, I found countless times she had convinced me to stay. I would message her saying 'I feel unsafe, but I'm afraid to leave' and her response was consistently 'what did you do wrong, you should apologize to him.' I might have left 6 months in, instead of 7 years later, if my mother hadn't been encouraging me to stay. 

I became estranged from my  father when I was 16, because he sexually assaulted me. Now, after sharing my feelings with my mom, she stopped talking to me. I feel like I might as well be an orphan. My abuser has his mom by his side to fix everything for him, and I am alone trying to pick up the pieces. 

I have amazing support from my friends, but goddamn, I just want my mommy, and she refuses to be there for me.

Severe Domestic Violence and Possible Outcomes?,"Im hoping to get answers and opinions.

I have a friend who had moved into a low budget neighborhood and has only been trouble since.

She met a man in the same apartment complex and started hanging out and became romantic until she started seeing red flags after a couple months. The previous residents of her apartment were part of Domestic violence as well and the lock would not lock on her door. At some point, he had taken her keys and made a copy without her knowledge. So for about a month+ he comes in and stays without her consent and has gotten more violent as time passes. As far as Im aware, there is rape, death threats of family and anyone who is willing to get in the way, sexual assault, blades to her throat, and keeps her up at consistently as night so she is sleep deprived and has weapons with him all the time.

Ive offered help and got her lock fixed through a handyman because the landlords wont fix it for her. but even then he still has a copy of the key. She's got a long list of abuse done to her and has a recording of him talking about the death threats, his obsession and agreeing to some physical violence.

She's finally reached out to the cops after Ive suggested getting a Protective Order but she's worried that hes the kind of man to kill her and himself if an order is put in place. And even if he is convicted of his felonies, She's worried about Him being able to pay Bail and then its back to the normal stuff.

She can only afford this housing and has a kid shes trying to put into a decent school so moving is off the table.

What Are the consequences of violating a Protective order? She says he'll only be held for 24hrs but that doesn't seem right.
Is she right to be scared and not go through with the Protective Order?
what other options are there? 
Security systems? Resources?
I can only help so much but its all up to her

  
Thank You!

"Destructive partner, won’t leave, please help","This is a very long story, just a forewarning... but a 100% real life scscenario I'm in.

I'm the the male in a m/f relationship, we're the same age, close to 30s. We both have drinking issues, but she is a violent and angry drinker. I am not, I go to school, go to work. I've never been arrested, never really lost my shit before. ""High functioning"" alcoholic as it's described. Not saying it's good, I just keep to myself and don't really make noise. We got together long after I knew her from adolescence (6-7 years since we both graduated when we got together) so I was a little more willing to look past the minor things because we had a little bit of a bond. But the minor things became major things, quickly and unexpectedly.

After multiple domestic disturbances in which she was removed from our (my) place, I called in 1 her family and a neighbor called in the other two. Fighting over nothing, yelling screaming, threatening self harm threats any time I try to break it off (turns out she has a history of this) I had just bought the house, she has had no job, and paid 0 bills for 6 years (and she is not on the deed). I was originally Ok with the cooking/cleaning being her responsibility while I cover 90+% of expenses, and she was too. Well the 3rd time she mad a scene, she assaulted a cop and resisted arrest (she's like a 120 pound girl) and he knew her from before and they actually took her. 

I refused to pick her up obviously, giving her the keys was letting her right back into my life. Almost immediately she had to move in with her family in a bordering state, she received a domestic assault charge getting in a fight with her direct family, I had 0 to do with, she was taken to court by the state. I know this from digging because the conditions of getting her things back to her family was very odd, like they could not individually contact her any time they came to pick her things up and a simple question came up like ""where is it? Do you know what she means by this?"" She has a pending court case for that still now, and this was 1 1/2 ago, anyone who knows knows, post Covid judges in rural areas are pushing dates back and back and back unless you're violent felon level.

She was sober for a year. I let her back in like a fucking idiot (but wait there's more) a little more than a year ago. She cleaned up. And we had an awesome relationship for over 400 days. She got into a fight with her family one random night relapsed instantly. Puking, spilling shit everywhere. Started fights again. Neighbors and her family called once each again. She'd been taken away same fashion and brought to county finally after she assaulted a cop right in front of me AGAIN.

This is where it gets to the point where I'm right now absolutely furious and like... I'm about to become the bad guy with how angry I am after being 100% cooperative and level headed the whole time. She's assaulted a cop twice, resisted arrest twice, she's on probation or whatever for domestic assault, and violated every condition in the book. Surely something's going to stick. One day later, while I'm at university, county gives her a personal drive back to the same residence (my home) the incident occurred. And the maintenance guy in my complex let her in without my permission. I call the cops and I'm a little salty. They throw it back but I kind of stand up for myself. ""Well you've let her back in"" yeah well I fuckin didn't do it this time and that was over a year ago, she was hand delivered back to my door and given access without permission. To which he tells me I have to evict her, even if she pays no bills, and has a criminal record for domestic assault, and they've seen her like 6 times under the same circumstances.

So I look at him and I say, ""so after everything that's happened, that's it? That's all I can do?"" ""Yes, do you know how many times we've been here."" I agree with him, ""yeah too much, but how many times has it been because of my behavior?"" I ask him ""how come every time she comes back to me from you guys and now county she's loaded with bruises and now a fresh black eye, but whenever you come here to respond she's untouched."" 

He was there the night before so I ask him,""you were here last night, see that black eye (pretty solid one), it wasn't here last night when she left here was it?"" He kind of backtracks and says yeah no she didn't have any marks last night. I'm just trying to push back at the notion that we're just trash and I beat her in secret and she's lashing out. I've never laid hands on her.

So I'm stuck with her after all this in this very moment. My mother just died this past week. One night later she starts getting hammered and taking pills. Saying that it is because ""she is so sad for me and it's hard for her to handle it."" My mom. Then she starts fights again. I'm doing pre med classes for 7+ hours and figuring out my mothers arrangements the Past two nights, and she's left a burning stove top on and a panini press on for no reason that almost set the cabinets on fire at 1 am. Shes puking, can't form a sentence, most selfish person I've ever seen when she's drunk. And she is NEVER a manageable drunk. So the second ""half"" of the story after the long and good sobriety stint has all taken place in the last two weeks and the burning shit, almost starting fires, puking everywhere, falling all over the place, accidentally breaking shit from stumbling and starting fights over me saying a single word about her not acting like a toddler (in a nice way).   

Am I actually like powerless to do anything in this situation without evicting her? Her names not on a single bill, she hasn't paid a dollar. She has a criminal record, pending sentencing for domestic assault against her family (watch it get dropped) and a consistent record of resisting arrest, putting her hands on officers, and basically making massive public scenes.

I'm getting the vibe the police either do not like me, don't want to deal with it or they're basically just waiting for one of us to snap and go so far over the line one of us will actually get convicted. I'd never say us in the past, but at this point I feel cornered, and if they don't do something soon, something bad is going to happen and it's either going to be her putting me in danger in my own home (again) or me taking matters into my own hands to stop her from doing it.

Sorry for any misspellings or repetitions. I'm like shaking typing this out. Has anyone had a situation where someone will NOT let you break up with them, stay in your home, and when you finally get them out, they get off Scot-free (again) and delivered back to your door. and when you contact the same people from the very same night before they basically tell you too bad?

I didn't realize emotional/psych abuse counts,"So sorry for the length. 

I was trying to stay away from narcissists because I married one before he punched me on the honeymoon, and then I filed for divorce at the end of that month. So I found this guy and he did not seem to love bomb me. In fact, he didn't seem over the top about anything. One of the things people notice first about him is how CALM he is. I don't say this casually — I'm a researcher and have a therapist and don't just make wild claims — but he's a sociopath.

I realize now, after violent outbursts of anger that come from nowhere, intimidation, gaslighting, twisting my words, invalidating my sexual assaults and calling me promiscuous and even going so far as to defend certain things those guys did to me, telling me I can't wear various clothes out without him (crop top and jeans??), telling me I can't go to certain places, threatening to leave me at least once a month since we've been together, being extremely rough with me (he's a physical therapist) when I've been in in pain and he's been ""helping"" me, calling me ""ungrateful"" and ""cold"" and even insisting I don't know my own birthday, to the point where I've been so confused and questioned my age (38). I used to be a performing musician. He threatened to leave me when I found a pianist, told me I can't perform anymore. If he's in the mood, he'll try to make me prove everything I say in casual conversation with an article or give up as he tells me I don't know anything and just make wild, unfounded claims (again, I'm a researcher). He jokes with other people, in front of me, ""Poor (my name), she has to put up with my terrible moods."" He will make wild accusations about how terrible I am to him, just to apologize later and say he realizes they weren't true, so I generally forgive him and find something that I've done wrong, too, because he doesn't like to apologize if he's the only one apologizing. I went back to Greece with him (he's Greek, and I'm American), and he's straight up just left me out of hours-long conversations like I didn't exist, told me I shouldn't have come, and then stranded me for hours while he was supposed to be running one quick errand — told me his entire family loved me so much and then, when I was sad about something later that day, became so angry at me and yelled at me to ""get the fuck out of my apartment."" He's tried to break up with me once a month (at least) since we've been together, and when he does, he does so coldly and then STARES at me, like STARES, to see how much he's hurting me, and if I don't react, he twists the knife even more and just keeps saying things he thinks will devastate me until I crack, and then he says we can stay together.

He's made so many countless promises he never intended to keep, specifically about working on his anger, and then has tried to break up with me when I've asked about them. He's told lies about me to his friends and my family, that I am anal retentive about how I keep the house (I'm not). 

Last night, he went from being very happy after he came home from work to yelling at me for sending an email to my hair stylist because I couldn't book an appointment through her website when he wanted to watch TV \*\*with\*\* me. I had been doing that when he got home from work 5 minutes prior. Then he threw his food at his plate, told me he tired of my ""bullshit"" and when I said I had no idea what he meant, told me I do know and how am I so cold? And then went downstairs. Came up 5 min later, where I'd locked myself in my office with my dog, and apologized again and asked to talk. I don't want to talk. 

I've told him so many times how afraid I am of him in his anger. Eventually, I went to sleep on the edge of the bed. When he woke up, he put his hands on me, and I said ""I don't want to"" right now, but he said ""I know I know, but I just want to give you a hug,"" and I said I don't want to, and he wrapped his arms around me, anyway, and squeezed. 

I feel sick. I feel scared. ChatGPT is giving me play-by-plays of what his next steps will likely be, and it's weird how it's been spot on, and how I should react in survival mode. I think it's saving my life right now. I was lying awake last night, in bed, scared that he'd try to kill me in my sleep because I knew he wasn't sleeping, but there's nowhere else to sleep and my dog won't relax if he and I sleep apart.

I tried to comfort myself by saying that we actually got this house rental because so many of his coworkers live in the neighbor and know the owner of the house. I wish they knew what kind of person he was and what goes on in this house.

I feel scared and broken and so so so alone. I have some savings, but I didn't have a job for the past 4 months and JUST was hired by a new place and started some businesses, partnerships, because I'm terrified a new place I try to rent will want to see my history of income, and I'll have nothing for the past 3 months. I don't know if I can hold on 3 more months before getting out of this lease. 

I don't know why I'm so afraid of the breakup. When we're not face to face, it's all I want. But when he's threatening and intimidating me and staring at me, I feel sick and broken and TERRIFIED of what will happen next. I don't trust him. 

I know this probably doesn't sound like much, but it is to me. The fact I didn't realize this was a huge cycle or that his anger and threats and intimidation and coercion are, by and large, calculated...it's even more terrifying than just some guy who can't control his temper. I really hope this does not turn physical, but again, I don't think he could risk that with his reputation.

I didn't know it was considered DV, though I did know it's abusive. I'm working so hard to be positive, to focus on work, to navigate a very, very scary man and not screw myself over more in the meantime.","I didn't realize emotional/psych abuse counts So sorry for the length.

I don't say this casually — I'm a researcher and have a therapist and don't just make wild claims — but he's a sociopath.

I realize now, after violent outbursts of anger that come from nowhere, intimidation, gaslighting, twisting my words, invalidating my sexual assaults and calling me promiscuous and even going so far as to defend certain things those guys did to me, telling me I can't wear various clothes out without him (crop top and jeans??), telling me I can't go to certain places, threatening to leave me at least once a month since we've been together, being extremely rough with me (he's a physical therapist) when I've been in in pain and he's been ""helping"" me, calling me ""ungrateful"" and ""cold"" and even insisting I don't know my own birthday, to the point where I've been so confused and questioned my age (38). I used to be a performing musician. He threatened to leave me when I found a pianist, told me I can't perform anymore. If he's in the mood, he'll try to make me prove everything I say in casual conversation with an article or give up as he tells me I don't know anything and just make wild, unfounded claims (again, I'm a researcher). He jokes with other people, in front of me, ""Poor (my name), she has to put up with my terrible moods."" He will make wild accusations about how terrible I am to him, just to apologize later and say he realizes they weren't true, so I generally forgive him and find something that I've done wrong, too, because he doesn't like to apologize if he's the only one apologizing. I went back to Greece with him (he's Greek, and I'm American), and he's straight up just left me out of hours-long conversations like I didn't exist, told me I shouldn't have come, and then stranded me for hours while he was supposed to be running one quick errand — told me his entire family loved me so much and then, when I was sad about something later that day, became so angry at me and yelled at me to ""get the fuck out of my apartment."" He's tried to break up with me once a month (at least) since we've been together, and when he does, he does so coldly and then STARES at me, like STARES, to see how much he's hurting me, and if I don't react, he twists the knife even more and just keeps saying things he thinks will devastate me until I crack, and then he says we can stay together.

He's made so many countless promises he never intended to keep, specifically about working on his anger, and then has tried to break up with me when I've asked about them. He's told lies about me to his friends and my family, that I am anal retentive about how I keep the house (I'm not). 

Last night, he went from being very happy after he came home from work to yelling at me for sending an email to my hair stylist because I couldn't book an appointment through her website when he wanted to watch TV \*\*with\*\* me. I had been doing that when he got home from work 5 minutes prior. Then he threw his food at his plate, told me he tired of my ""bullshit"" and when I said I had no idea what he meant, told me I do know and how am I so cold? And then went downstairs. Came up 5 min later, where I'd locked myself in my office with my dog, and apologized again and asked to talk. I don't want to talk. 

I've told him so many times how afraid I am of him in his anger. Eventually, I went to sleep on the edge of the bed. When he woke up, he put his hands on me, and I said ""I don't want to"" right now, but he said ""I know I know, but I just want to give you a hug,"" and I said I don't want to, and he wrapped his arms around me, anyway, and squeezed. 

I feel sick. I feel scared. ChatGPT is giving me play-by-plays of what his next steps will likely be, and it's weird how it's been spot on, and how I should react in survival mode. I think it's saving my life right now. I was lying awake last night, in bed, scared that he'd try to kill me in my sleep because I knew he wasn't sleeping, but there's nowhere else to sleep and my dog won't relax if he and I sleep apart.

I tried to comfort myself by saying that we actually got this house rental because so many of his coworkers live in the neighbor and know the owner of the house. I wish they knew what kind of person he was and what goes on in this house.

I feel scared and broken and so so so alone. I have some savings, but I didn't have a job for the past 4 months and JUST was hired by a new place and started some businesses, partnerships, because I'm terrified a new place I try to rent will want to see my history of income, and I'll have nothing for the past 3 months. I don't know if I can hold on 3 more months before getting out of this lease. 

I don't know why I'm so afraid of the breakup. When we're not face to face, it's all I want. But when he's threatening and intimidating me and staring at me, I feel sick and broken and TERRIFIED of what will happen next. I don't trust him. 

I know this probably doesn't sound like much, but it is to me. The fact I didn't realize this was a huge cycle or that his anger and threats and intimidation and coercion are, by and large, calculated...it's even more terrifying than just some guy who can't control his temper. I really hope this does not turn physical, but again, I don't think he could risk that with his reputation.

I didn't know it was considered DV, though I did know it's abusive. I'm working so hard to be positive, to focus on work, to navigate a very, very scary man and not screw myself over more in the meantime.",1,"[('try to kill me', 0.740170419216156)]",0

Hi I posted this yesterday but I got locked out of my account so had to come on on this one as I didn’t even see it I got any replies. 

So 8 months ago I had to ring the police he got arrested and we haven’t spoken since. Cops pursuing charges of controlling & coercive behaviour & assault. (Assault was not major, slight injury to my eye, affecting my sight, not permanently & wasn’t a visible injury) & locked me in wouldn’t let me leave, this lasted around half hour maybe less, until I got on to police emergency. He’s been violent before probably about 2 year ago, multiple times back then, pushing shoving spitting a bite, slaps ect, aggression such as smashing things etc. back then I’d be scared in the moment but more scared that he was ending it with me, because that’s what he’d be telling me, that he was done with me ect. Prior to recent assault it was all verbal & emotional, he said they were regular rows & I was the cause, I believed  this but my friends / family said it was abuse, I didn’t know what to think apart from feeling depressed hopeless useless & just sad & embarrassed that I’d turned him against me. He’d often try to be affectionate but I normally refused because either I’d worry I’d do something wrong & he’d get upset with me or he’d get angry if I wanted to get a drink or move for example (sometimes small things like that would really annoy him) he also said I didn’t spend enough time with him but I used to get worried about seeing him cause the arguments & how he would speak to me would get to me. I think over those things now & feel like I didn’t put enough effort in. Because I was always down and probably didn’t try but I’d find it hard to forget how he’d spoke to me or something & then me being quiet would cause more problems.  I felt I’d made the right decision 2 weeks after the assault, I kept remembering how scared I’d been & thought I need to stay away, now though I wake up crying about him, I have nightmares where I realise I’ve lost him, I feel I’ve thrown my future away. The love was real and makes me feel like I wish I’d stayed even though it was hard because it was my soulmate. I’ve dropped charges with the police and reached out to him but he has ignored me. I have tried for the last months to block him out but I couldn’t keep lying to myself about how I feel, I wish he’d contact me. I am so so sad all of the time and don’t see it ever stopping. How will I ever know if it was abusive or if I was just a bad gf & drove him to those things.

My boyfriend got arrested for domestic violence last night.,"We had an argument and he grabbed me and physically attacked me, I took photos of the injuries and had to go to the police after he refused to allow me to get my property out and move, I went only to get an officer to come with me to get my belongings out, which they said they would do if I went down to get an officer, when there they had me make a declaration and then they called him down and arrested him. 

I honestly wasn't expecting that nor wanted him to get charged, I simply wanted an order to allow me to get my property and leave, he has had a prior order on him from an ex whom he grabbed by the throat while angry but that order wqs removed by his ex. 

Honestly he is a good guy and this incident was an isolated event with me, he has never otherwise physically hurt me or assaulted me before, i don't want to see him go to jail and i'm scheduled in the morning to go in at 9am back at the police station they said. I made it clear to the officer that i simply wanted to get my belongings and wasn't looking to get a restraining order or press charges on him.

Is there anything i can do to remove the charges?  Even though he grabbed me like that and did get physical i feel this has gone way beyond what it needed and a simple order to allow me to take my things and move out. He isn't an otherwise bad person or someone who would abuse me, I think he just git very upset and was trying to hold me back in his frustration.

Even in the prior incident with his ex his ex cancelled his restraining order as he was the one who made the situation worse and agravated him.

What should i do? I don't want to see him go to jail and regardless of the relationship ending it hurts to see him possibly face jail and have to go through such a process when he is otherwise a good person.","My boyfriend got arrested for domestic violence last night.

Please help me understand this. It’s driving me insane!,"Somebody please help me understand because this is driving me crazy. My ex and I were together six years, but I recently left when the relationship became abusive. We have two kids together (ages 1 and 3) and he has a child from a previous relationship. Since all of our issues hit the fan and legal proceedings got involved, he's completely abandoned our children. He hasn't tried to send anything at all (nor his family). Forthwrmore, one of our children's birthdays was two weeks ago and his other child's birthday (from his previous relationship) is today. Heard nothing at all from him on our baby's birthday and his family said they'd get her gifts this week (which to me is messed up that they'd wait to get it) and I've yet to hear anything since then. 

Today, my ex has been playing songs like ""Color him Father"" and a whole bunch of other stuff to paint himself as a great dad....on this other child's birthday. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, I'm so upset and more so because I just don't get it. How can someone really try to paint themselves as great knowing they're completely, literally, not doing anything at all or tryi it to be in his two youngest babies lives while pouring into another. 

For context: I found out he was abusive to his ex as well, which is a big reason why they broke up and her family cannot stand him. Their situations never had police involved. I don't know if things have changed now, but it also why she would never tell him where she lived and they'd have to exchange their child at her mothers house. I thought it was because he cheated on her..but I guess that was just a small part of the story.

What early warning signs have you experienced?,"Has anyone else gotten out of an abusive relationship early on? What kind of subtle warning signs have you all experienced when you were with your abuser? It feels really weird to look back at what happened when I was in my last relationship.

One time he squeezed it and I couldn’t breath f rom it for a few seconds. I think that’s one of the instances that’s made me realize that it most likely was abusive. It’s just really confusing to me because he acted so sweet all the time. He never got angry at me. He never said anything mean to me. It’s also been difficult because when I was in the relationship, I didn’t remember any of it. I only remembered all the bad stuff 3 months after breaking up with him. I just need to know if anyone else has been through something like this? When you were in your abusive relationship, did they seem perfect? Did they ever seem aggressive or angry early into your relationship? How did they get what they wanted from you, were they manipulative?",0,[],0
