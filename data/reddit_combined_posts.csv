1jajams,Abused wants to tell the abuser that she‚Äôs leaving,MyMonkeyCircus,19,84,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jajams/abused_wants_to_tell_the_abuser_that_shes_leaving/,"UPDATE. SHE LEFT and is in a hotel until she can connect with local resources. She is a mess, but we‚Äôll take it one step at a time.

She left a day earlier because his weekend shift got cancelled and she realized he will likely ‚Äúcelebrate‚Äù that extra free day with a drink.

Your comments and stories helped a lot. After discussing them over the phone, she realized that she cannot afford to spend one more weekend with him, because it will very likely become her last weekend.

She did not tell him anything and didn‚Äôt leave the letter. She, unfortunately, decided to take his call, and he went from ‚Äúlove of my life, where are you, I am worried sick‚Äù to a ‚Äúyou dirty bitch, you used me‚Äù real quick. She blocked him after the call. I do not think he can track her - he isn‚Äôt exactly technical, their phones have different operating systems, and she disabled l location services. 

Thank you all very much.

Disclaimer: I am writing about a situation of my relative because her reddit is being actively monitored by her abuser. I will be able to call her to share comments. 

I do not know all the details and their history of the abuse, I only know that ‚Äúit was not that bad before‚Äù and that it has rapidly escalated about a month ago - that‚Äôs when she reached out to me for help. He hit and strangled her several times, there are photos of bruises on her neck and recordings of conversation that lead to one of the attacks.

She is ready to leave this weekend while he is at work. She has most basics packed, some cash stashed, and a temporary housing arranged in a different city. She, however, feels uneasy about leaving unannounced. She wants to somehow let him know that she left. She is convinced that it isn‚Äôt a big deal because the abuser is only physically violent when he is drunk. She says she only expects him to be verbally aggressive.

I think it is a bad idea because what if her farewell causes things to escalate even more? He is a very strong man and she is a physically sick weak woman. There is absolutely no way she can fight back if he attacks her again. I believe she is not dead only because he let her live.

I need some tips/advice please.",2025-03-13 18:40:30,2025-03-17 03:01:03,abuse

1j6fl1n,I know my relationship is abusive & I can‚Äôt leave,Illustrious_Elk_7292,20,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j6fl1n/i_know_my_relationship_is_abusive_i_cant_leave/,"
(Warning long post sorry)

I am 22, my boyfriend is 28, I am 34 weeks pregnant with his child and we have been together for only a year. I‚Äôve never had feelings so strongly for someone so quick, to me he was the biggest sweetheart I‚Äôve ever met but I could tell from the get go there were a few red flags.

Our relationship sort of consisted of going out, drinking and doing drugs before I got pregnant, he‚Äôs also got another child he can‚Äôt see for unknown reasons. He tried pressuring me to get an abortion but I felt so much love for the baby and it just changed something in me instantly so I didn‚Äôt go ahead, it didn‚Äôt matter to me whether he was there or not because I knew I could handle it on my own.

In the last few months, our relationship has completely deteriorated. Whenever he drinks, he all of a sudden hates me and wants to hurt me.

The first time it happened (probs around 16 weeks into my pregnancy), we were at a pub with my parents, we went home as normal and then something switched in him. He started saying really hurtful things sending me into a panic attack and getting aggressive for not letting him drive drunk, he ended up driving very erratically and I was scared for my life and vomited on myself which he called me disgusting for, and grabbed my arm so hard and twisted it, then threatened to break my arm because I wanted to jump out of the car. When we got home he threatened to break my laptop and pushed me over. 

I have had 4 other situations similar to this, which he denies ever happened.

The fact that he doesn‚Äôt admit it, has made me insane to the point I can‚Äôt leave him alone because I just want some kind of closure. I feel absolutely crazy and selfish for risking the babies health because I can‚Äôt manage my emotions and leave the relationship. I love her so much and I get so angry with myself when I let him do this again, I don‚Äôt know why I trust that he won‚Äôt. I hate myself.

I love him when he‚Äôs sober, I can‚Äôt bare the fact he is like this now and I hate him so much but I still hold on to that version of him that once made me so happy but I know he‚Äôs gone.

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. How do you move on without getting the closure you want so bad and accepting that person you once loved is gone? My family physically abused me and did this to me growing up also which is really triggering üòï",2025-03-08 11:53:25,2025-03-17 03:01:10,abuse
1iahvds,Did your abuser pay for dinner on the first date?,bengalbear24,18,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iahvds/did_your_abuser_pay_for_dinner_on_the_first_date/,"I‚Äôm trying to study all the red flags so I can know what to avoid next time and ideally cut it off early, after the first date. I‚Äôm trying to understand if there‚Äôs any correlation between abuse and whether they pay for the first date. Both of my emotionally abusive ex‚Äôs agreed to split the bill on the first date when I offered when the check came, with no pushback or insistence that they pay (despite asking me out). At the time I didn‚Äôt see it as a red flag because I was into feminism and equality, and I thought that meant that I should pay for my own meal. I never expected a man to pay for me on a date, but now I‚Äôm wondering if that was an early sign of disrespect.

I know there are arguments on both sides of this, and that many abusers probably have offered or insisted to pay. A lot of them can appear charming and chivalrous early on, intensely pursue, or love-bomb you. I‚Äôm not sure how I should feel about this and whether I should expect a man to pay for the first date, if I should offer to split the check or just let him treat me and thank him, and if I should see him asking or allowing me to pay as a red flag. Perhaps whether they pay for the first date isn‚Äôt even correlated with abuse, but I‚Äôm desperately trying to find patterns early on to avoid it next time.

1h6qw8r,Why do people defend abusers?,burneracct808,27,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1h6qw8r/why_do_people_defend_abusers/,"I understand this in a textbook and a psychology perspective sense, but I can never personally understand it? I‚Äôm thankfully out of my DV relationship. We‚Äôve had a kid together, so unfortunately this means we‚Äôre in the legal process right now. This process has shown me how much people will lie in the court of law and just lie in general to defend my abuser. It‚Äôs insane.

Most of them are victims themselves of other DV experiences, but this perpetuates the cycle. Most of them are family members of his, family members with kids. Why would you want to risk lying in court for an abuser? To risk your own family? What are they teaching their kids?

Others are people who are in an ongoing DV relationship and have to defend him because their abuser is friends with my abuser. I understand because they are not safe as they are still with their abuser, but if the roles were ever reversed I‚Äôd do what it takes to defend the victims for legal matters or any matters too and if I was still with my abuser I‚Äôd still be defending them, despite any repercussions that I‚Äôd receive. Some situations may be more extreme, of course, and simply cannot. But why defend my abuser? It‚Äôs okay if they don‚Äôt aid me or do anything that will harm them or their kids, I don‚Äôt need or want that to happen, but why defend him?? As if they don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs done to me and in the same situation themselves. Why act as if he‚Äôs the victim??

1ganvb9,Do you think abusers can change with therapy?,Stripawaymylove,34,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ganvb9/do_you_think_abusers_can_change_with_therapy/,"I escaped an abusive relationship that had spousal rape with emotional abuse and manipulation. It took me farrrrr longer to leave than I would have preferred but it ultimately came down to he was abusing our cats and he ultimately killed one of the kittens. I saw the light that day, that if he could do that to a kitten who knows what he could do to me. Also, I don‚Äôt think anyone who kills a kitten is redeemable. This was back in 2014/2015 when we were both 22/24. 

Everytime I see a post on Reddit where a woman is complaint of their male partner I IMMEDIATELY assume it‚Äôs him until I read on and it‚Äôs not. This sparks my curiosity to see what he‚Äôs up to and look him up. 

Well, I recently saw that he was engaged to a woman with a child and a pet. I immediately got scared for her life and ended up sending her a message letting her know about what happened and to be careful with this man. 

Thankfully she didn‚Äôt respond in anger but honestly as a ‚ÄúI know about all of this, he‚Äôs gotten therapy, and has been nothing but perfect to me.‚Äù 

I know I should just let them be but I also wonder if he‚Äôs really changed and gotten better? Do you think that‚Äôs possible? I think he‚Äôs become a better abuser as time has gone on and he‚Äôs hiding it for longer. I wanna see the best in others but I have my doubts and I‚Äôm still scared for her. I‚Äôm not gonna respond because nothing more I can do. I just hope that message will be there to validate her if he does change back to his abusive ways.

1i27h34,When did you realize you were being abused?,anonykitcat,20,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1i27h34/when_did_you_realize_you_were_being_abused/,"My realization happened slowly and gradually. He started behaving abusively about 4 months in, but I blamed myself and took just as much responsibility for the incident. Then he did again and again, every few weeks or so, until I started slowly realizing that it was a pattern. By the 1-year mark, I had fully realized (and told him) that he was emotionally and verbally abusing me. However, despite this realization, it had not sunk in that I was in an abusive relationship -- just that he was behaving abusively to me sometimes (when we were fighting). I didn't realize yet about the cycle of abuse, or the fact that abuse doesn't need to happen all the time or even most of the time for it to count as real abuse. I also didn't really think that verbal/emotional abuse were ""real"" abuse, and that since he hadn't hit me, it wasn't that bad.

About 3-4 years in, I became aware that it was a real problem and started to maybe consider I was in an abusive relationship. But still, a lot of denial, a lot of downplaying it, blaming myself for it, accepting his apologies, hoping it would get better. And still, I didn't think it was real abuse since he hadn't hit me.

Only now, after almost 5 years, do I fully realize that this is an abusive relationship and that I am stuck in a trauma-bond with him. It's taken me several books, calls to domestic violence centers, websites, therapists, a friend, a couple of family members, and hundreds of people on reddit to tell me that his behaviors are textbook abuse. Even after that, I have been in and out of a state of denial for the past year, thinking ""well his behaviors are abusive¬†*sometimes*, but it's not actually an abusive relationship"", or ""he has never hit me/hurt me, so it's not really¬†*real*¬†or seriously¬†*bad*¬†abuse"".

Part of the reason I haven't believed it is because he would constantly mock me/invalidate me/gaslight me about it. I tried to tell him so many times that he was being abusive to me, and he laughed at it saying I was acting like a victim which was pathetic, that I wanted to be a victim, that I was behaving dramatically as if I was covered head to toe in bruises or like he had beaten the shit out of me. So many people have tried to get this through my head, but I still believed him over everyone else. I feel ashamed for taking so long to realize this, for being in denial, and for being stuck in it for years.

So -- how long did it take you to realize it was abuse, and at what point did the denial stop?",2025-01-15 20:52:25,2025-03-17 03:01:20,abuse

Should I warn her? Or just leave it be to avoid drama? I worry for her safety, he was emotionally and verbally abusive quickly but has a charismatic personality that will pull you in. Very good at love bombing and making you feel special at first, then starts the gaslighting, anger issues, and controlling. 

He also has a baby daughter with an ex wife that he sees weekly, and I worry for their safety too. He is unstable. Should I try to contact anyone about what happened or just move on?

We are renting a house and our lease ends in October 2025. It is only my name on the lease as he has bad rental history and credit.

My boyfriend has been escalating in his physical abuse, ranging from strangulation to now punching in head, arm, legs, back, and ribs. I know I am in danger of serious harm. He has even made threats to kill me. I know it isn't right, and I am ready to leave.

I know it won't be easy, and I do not want the police involved, even though I feel like that is inevitable, I do not want the police involved because:

1. I do not want to press any criminal charges
2. He is on probation, and I do not want him to get locked him (most likely if I get a protection order).
3. He said if I call the police he will kill me

I have already told my family and friends my decision on leaving (not the abuse of course, otherwise I know my mother would literally kill him). They offered to help me with his half of the rent, moving expenses, etc to come home. However, a part of me feels this is too much to ask as it'll be a lot of money.

Are there any alternatives to a protection order? Right now, I don't have a plan. I just want him out, but I'm afraid he will break another window, or follow through with his threats if I change the locks.

Here's some more context:

\- I work about 40 minutes from my house with a hybrid schedule, Mostly remote. However, I just started about 2 months ago so I do not want to abuse that privilege too much too soon.

\- I live about 4 hours away from my ""home."" So if I go ""home,"" I'm not sure how this job will work out, and I really really like and want to keep this job.

\- We just moved into this house in October. The landlord said before we signed the lease that if we break it and move out, we must pay 85% of the total rent for the remaining months (roughly $9,350). Even though I know my landlord is very reasonable and an understanding guy, I don't know if I'm able to tell him what is going on within his home. Yes, it'll get me out of the lease relatively easily, it feels too much, I can't explain it. On the other hand, my boyfriend has already broke a window that has yet to be repaired.

I am scared to get a protection order because I am afraid it'll make him worse. As of right now, I don't know what to do first, or how to go about anything. Any advice is greatly appreciated. TYIA",2024-12-12 05:48:38,2025-03-17 03:01:33,abuse
1i2bbtf,Warning my abusers new wife,Rich-Yogurtcloset964,16,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1i2bbtf/warning_my_abusers_new_wife/,"Edit/Update:
Thank you to everyone who responded and shared your stories. I see I am not alone in this situation and that it is never easy for anyone. For now, I am going to take what most of you suggested to do and stay out of it, at least until my case is over. As much as I would love to prevent future harm, I don't think I can by warning her. I know my abuser is a dangerous and volatile person, which is why I have pressed charges twice. He is also incredibly manipulative, which is why I stayed with him for five years despite major red flags. I don't think I would have heard the warning in the early honeymoon stages and I doubt this person would either if she married him so quickly. What an awful world these people create for us. I'll leave this post up for anyone else who might be in a similar situation. Good luck to all, wherever you are on your path out.   

I'm in a moral quandary.
Ex was brutal and dangerous. I am the victim in a current criminal case against him, the second one, this time for aggravated assault. There is a restraining order in place. The relationship ended when he tried to end my life. I was preparing to leave when it happened. He was increasingly violent from about 6 months in. This happened almost 7 years ago. 

I just found out he's newly married. I feel the most powerful urge to warn her, but I worry it might hurt the case or put me in danger. I have looked up defamation laws in my area, it seems like I would be fine as long as my wording is careful and I stick to facts. I can reach her at her job, where she will most likely be alone. There's a high chance he will leave my country to avoid sentencing and take her with him to a place that has a terrible record for women's rights. My husband and I concluded that i have a moral duty to inform, but I worry I might be reacting as a traumatic response. Can anyone please advise? Have you done this as the survivor?

This time, it sounded like it was escalating. There was stomping and frantic sliding of feet. I went upstairs quickly and quietly, and opened the living room door without knocking (we all live in the the same two story unit).

I saw them standing, pressed hard against each other. His right arm was over her shoulder and around her neck. He had her in a head lock. I could only see the top of her head. 

It only lasted for a split second until they noticed me, and I immediately led by stating that there was way too much noise going on up here, and I pretended I didn't notice. I kept making it about the noise and my concern for him- I played the fool, and I think he bought it.

Oddly enough, I've studied abusive relationships in University. I think if I had confronted him then and there, not only would it change nothing, but it might even make it worse for her. 

I think I have a narrow window of advantage here, but I'm not sure what to do (despite studying the subject). Or at least, I'm not sure if my idea is the right one.

I need advice and help on this. Any input is deeply welcome and appreciated.

My idea, is to pretend I don't know, while my partner and her girl friends get closer to her without letting on. From what I've seen, social isolation is the enemy, and if I let on that I know they'll move out instantly and then I really can't help her.

--Update--
My partner and I talked a lot about everything, and we have a short-term plan. There's a few steps we're going to take:

0. When I have a private moment, I'll call the local DV hotline to get their opinion

1. Start documenting everything in a journal: times, descriptions, etc

2. Order a voice recorder off amazon and put it in the air vent between the floors. Hopefully we won't ever need it

3. During a time when he's not home, talk with her and say ""I'm going out to get some groceries, do you need anything? Because if you ever need anything, anything at all, all you have to do is let us know.""

4. Pretend like I saw nothing, that I simply was in the wrong, and that I'm embarrassed about how I got in the middle of their argument. Be freindly with him still

5. Start selling things I don't need and looking for a new apartment. This could take many months given where I live, but at least I can get ready and mobile so I can take cover my own back given the unstable living position

6. My partner's circle of girl friends will include her in their plans, build trust, and let her open up on her own time

7. I'll look for job postings for caf√©s or other places she could work and share them with her casually

8. I'll be prepared to call the police if I detect signs of violence. I'm much larger than the guy, so I think if I was just in the same room things would descalte while waiting for the police and I wouldn't need to get physical to protect her (not a problem if it is needed)

9. Do nothing else. I will not confront him unless I need to prevent physical violence. This is by far the hardest part.",2025-02-23 15:34:46,2025-03-17 03:01:36,abuse

He has always had signs of a temper and breaking things but I ignored it reminding myself how I used to throw and breaks things when I was younger. He was always accusing me of cheating, always wanted to know what I was doing, isolated me from my friends, telling me they were bad influences for me and kept me from my family more than I wanted to. In October after I went back to work postpartum, he quit his job to stay home with the twins. This is when things got bad. He would fight with me about every little thing, hated having the twins and reminded me how I ruined his life, he began putting his hands on me. He started off with throwing things at me like a box of used cat litter and hamper baskets to grabbing me behind the back of my neck and shoving me into the bed threatening to kill me. He escalated to grabbing me by my hair, throat and squeezing hard, picking me up and slamming me on the floor or bed, kicking me while I was on the floor, and punching me in the body. He started putting objects to my throat, scissors, screw drivers to my stomach, box cutter to throat and knife to my throat. He threatens to kill me when I tell him to leave and that there is nothing left. He says if we split then there's only one way out for me. He will kill me. He says he has nothing left to lose and if he goes down I am going down with him. He has threatened to slit my throat many times, he has given me concussions, bruises and a lot of heartbreak. I have loved this man from the beginning and supported him. Because of me he has a big new diesel truck in my name, gadgets that he could never afford, a new 5th wheel camper, and when he gets angry he damages expensive TV's, the truck, my cars and doesn't pay for the damages. I have to. He hasn't paid for one can of formula for the twins, clothes, or diapers. When I ask now that he is working again to buy this he conveniently forgets. But i cant express any anger, or frustration, because I don't want to get hit or threatened with a knife. He tells me if I call the police or get a restraining order that he will come back for me. He said he's patient, that he will kill me and my loved ones one by one, that's not a threat, it's a promise. I have two boys from a previous relationship and my twins. I am worried, I fear every day this will be the day we fight and he'll hurt me again, when we fight and he's beating me or putting a knife to my throat or holding my mouth and nose so I can't breath I fear this is the day I am going to die. My brain can't comprehend what's really going on, like I am in a numb state of shock. I know what is happening, but then again I don't. Like it's a horrible nightmare. My husband isn't really abusing me is he? I have no one to turn to. No one to talk to anymore. I am conflicted, lost, heartbroken. When he is in a good mood he's great, which confuses me all the more. This can't be the same man who tells me he hates me, that I am disgusting, that he is going to kill me, is it?

If I flinch, look frightened for a moment, or ask him why he's doing it, he will tell me that I'm too sensitive, paranoid, am no fun, and complain about how he can't even joke/play around with me without me massively overreacting. Sometimes he slaps/bites me a little harder than I like (not hard enough to leave bruises, but hard enough for me to say ""ow!"") and if I ask him to go gentler, he will complain that I'm way too sensitive and he can't even play around with me.

I took my dogs and left behind pretty much everything else I owned. I spent more than a week in hiding, afraid to go outside or even open the curtains. 

I have talked to my mom several times since I left, and almost every time, she's made me feel even worse. Yesterday she called me to check-in, and ended up calling my abuser a 'poor baby boy'. The man that had spent 7 years screaming that I was a worthless, stupid cunt. The man that spent 7 years insisting that I needed to meet his every emotional need, and I wasn't allowed to share my feelings. The man that detroyed my belongings, threw things at me, and then told me it was my fault because I hurt his feelings. The man that literally THREATENED TO KILL ME. 

He gets my house, my furniture, my cats, and most of the stuff in my home. I am currently staying in a bedroom so small that it doesn't fit anything besides the bed. I I'm losing most of what I owned, including my home and car. His family can probably afford a lawyer to fuck me out of all of the equity in our home. I have to start over completely, and somehow she still makes me feel bad, and makes him out to be the victim. 

While going through old messages, collecting documentation for an OFP, I found countless times she had convinced me to stay. I would message her saying 'I feel unsafe, but I'm afraid to leave' and her response was consistently 'what did you do wrong, you should apologize to him.' I might have left 6 months in, instead of 7 years later, if my mother hadn't been encouraging me to stay. 

I became estranged from my  father when I was 16, because he sexually assaulted me. Now, after sharing my feelings with my mom, she stopped talking to me. I feel like I might as well be an orphan. My abuser has his mom by his side to fix everything for him, and I am alone trying to pick up the pieces. 

I have amazing support from my friends, but goddamn, I just want my mommy, and she refuses to be there for me. ",2025-02-01 19:19:39,2025-03-17 03:01:48,abuse

when we met i liked to smoke üçÉ when we would hook up. then when i ‚Äúmoved in‚Äù it was a lot more, not that i asked, more like he would pack something (bong or joint) and then pass it to me. which i was okay with i guess? i thought he was being nice.

anyways since, if i try to say no about smoking, he gets mad or makes me feel guilty for not smoking or like im mad at him or something. 


so i feel if he gives me something i have to smoke it.


is this all my fault or is it abuse? would it even be considered abuse?",2025-02-27 14:05:04,2025-03-17 03:01:53,abuse
1i2jju1,Still abuse if they have a medical condition?,anonykitcat,3,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1i2jju1/still_abuse_if_they_have_a_medical_condition/,"This is the thing I'm really confused about, and is probably what's kept me staying for so long in an abusive relationship, because I keep making excuses for him. He has multiple mental health conditions, and possible a neurological disorder as well. So I've been excusing/forgiving all the terrible ways he's treated me, thinking that he is not mentally/neurologiclaly well, but I still love him regardless (when he's nice, he's very sweet, but he has extreme rage and anger issues that can be cruel and terrifying).

So -- if they have a serious mental health condition, is it still abuse?  
What about a physical/neurological condition?

If they act violently if they have a personality disorder, autism, chronic pain/illness, schizophrenia, dementia, Huntington's disease, etc...is it still considered ""abuse"", or is it just violent/unsafe behavior?

At what point should you stay with the person no matter what (even if they sometimes scare or endanger you) out of love and loyalty, vs prioritizing yourself/your own safety by leaving them?",2025-01-16 07:20:20,2025-03-17 03:01:54,abuse
1iezxh5,Does this count as abuse?,samurai_snape,13,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iezxh5/does_this_count_as_abuse/,"I'm 26M, and a couple of weeks ago, my girlfriend was in a really sad/low mood which she claimed was because she was PMSing. So I called her over to take care of her and we rented out a movie (the substance) and had dinner and everything was fine until the time we were about to go to sleep. Then she started a fight out of nowhere (she has a history of doing this every month). And she got so angry to a point where she got up from the bed, threw her phone on the ground and charged at me as I was standing and hit me with her fists. I turned in evasive action and she actually ended up hitting my arm. Mind you she didn't pull any punches and she really put some power into it. I was shocked by what had just happened and I think she immediately understood that she had fucked up. So she started apologizing, but I denied every approach. It was late in the night and I felt unsafe around her so I dropped her back to her place and told her that I need a break and she needs to work on her anger issues and take therapy. I just couldn't get my head around the fact that we had been together for 2.5 years and she decided to go to an extent that I never thought she would. 
I then proceeded to drown myself in alcohol for the rest of the weekend and for a couple extra days that I took off of work, because I didn't know what to make of it. I told her I needed time to even be able to talk to her. This week, she dropped off a letter at my place apologising for what she had done so I decided to meet her. She was apologetic, owning up to the harm she had caused and promised that she is willing to do everything to fix it. I maintained that it's going to take a long time to repair the trust and respect that I've lost for her and suggested couple's therapy. She agreed to it. Next day however, she completely flipped the script, calling her actions as an act of ""emotional outburst"" and not physical abuse. She said that I don't get to be the victim and villainise her and that I'm emotionally manipulating her in an attempt to feel more powerful in the relationship and dragging this just for the sake of it.
Folks, after hearing that, I don't know what to do. Is she right? I'm genuinely hurt and I genuinely need time. I don't know guys, I really don't know. Please, if you could give me your objective opinion on this, maybe it will help me plan my next course of action and I guess make sense of things ",2025-02-01 06:01:41,2025-03-17 03:01:56,abuse

I was lying in his bed ignoring him as he was yelling essentially to himself, saying he was going to go lay in another room, then coming back again. Then, he came over to the bed and violently shoved me to get my attention I obviously was shocked! Never before has he put his hands on me. I yelped a little bit out of fear and sat up and he stormed out of the room again. Only like 5 minutes later, he comes in and shoves me again!!

At this point I got livid, and yelled something like ‚Äúwhy did you just throw my purse at me!‚Äù he said he didn‚Äôt, he ‚Äúslapped it‚Äù (whatever that means?).

I went to rehab 3 times this summer but with all the bad memories I resort back to drinking. I barely like to eat anymore, it feels like a chore when food was one of the main things I used to enjoy.

When it comes to dating, I have to be drunk and one night stands only. When I'm sober in the morning I want to get away from that person because I don't want to get to know them or want a relationship with them. I ditched my apartment leaving only with my dog and my bible and let everything else go. I don't like seeing babies because it triggers me. I freak out when the motion lights come on that shine through my window. I don't watch tv, I watch security cameras. I'm short tempered with my family, and sober if a man approaches me I get anxiety.

He would isolate me making me feel like he was the only one giving me love, he never let me go anywhere without him, when he left for something he would lock the doors from the inside. He was a very nice person at heart, very caring, when we had disagreements he would love bomb me until I forgot and forgave, he was very varied though almost like hot and cold all the time. he convinced me that he did it out of love, to keep me safe or something. In my mind the one lie he told me. He cared about me so much he pointed out every single flaw with me, that really helped me be more self conscious about myself. Though sorry ex boyfriend that I was the problem, I full accept that. I still get horrible C-PTSD attacks because of him like nightmares, flashbacks, and hallucinations 

I‚Äôm currently in the hospital and I‚Äôve been here for four or five days because I took my attempt at getting out of all this pain, but my lovely boyfriend took me to the hospital for a acetaminophen overdose after I passed out near him.

1iitirz,My husband is abusive,ChrissyB_,12,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iitirz/my_husband_is_abusive/,"I will try to make this short. My husband and I have been married just over 3 years. In the past year, he has hit me probably 6 times. Before then it was pinning down or to a wall. I was pregnant at that time. He has a history of ripping doors off of hinges , frames, kicking down doors when I've locked it. 
These incidents don't include the times he has thrown objects, pulled a knife from a kitchen shieth and lunged like he was going to throw it at me from across the room
Last night, We got into a random fight. We have been "" better than ever"" the past month. I came home, exhausted from work. I ( for once) wasn't animated bubbly thanking him 5 times plus for cooking dinner because I worked. He was holding against me how I did the dishes after dinner ( took 5 minutes) because he wanted me to sit down and talk more about his work. He is a car salesman. I said I'm listening from here, I don't want to wake up with a sink of coagulation dishes. He became hostile.  Anyways, I was upset and sad because I came home tired, back literally KILLING me that day for some reason. I tried to reconcile by laying next to him on the couch. He barely budged and made it uncomfortable and was cold and hostile still. I was upset becsue I didn't do a thing wrong besides finally not done and kiss his feet for doing the bare minimum. 
I was upset, left the couch and said you really cannot cuddle me, and you're upset at me for what? He got nasty verbally with me and I said I'm going to bed. I asked if he was coming to bed tonight b3casue he JUST started sleeping in the room again. He had been sleeping in another room for the past year and a half since I had our daughter so he can have uninterrupted sleep. Since our breakthroughs in our unequal marriage ( domestic taks, flat out laziness and refusal to do a single thing) he had made progress. Well he finally came to bed woth me the prior two nights. The first night,  he laid in bed, and literally as he laid down next to me said"" you're welcome"".... because he came to the bedroom and was going to "" help"" with our 18 month old. Instantly I told him I'm not thanking him for coming to bed and doing what he should have been doing this whole time. Second night, copy paste. 
The third night comes and is what I was talking about before. 
Well I was upset becaue he promised to start coming to bed and I asked him if he is still planning on coming to bed. He said no I'm not. Becsuee he was mad that I did idk even what. I was pissed. Any time he is upset because I'm hurt or anything , he dropped any responsibilities and becomes a single man. Won't eat the dinner I made, will go get food for himself only and not me or the kids. Goes to his room when he gets home and ignores everyone all weekend.  Goes off without even telling me he has left even though he was the last one watching the girls. He is behind manipulative, controlling, and hateful. I am overly kind and I know that is a fault here. 

Anyways. I stood my ground after three years of his relapsing and going back on his word. I said fine, I'm going to your room ( the room he sleeps in) and you can care for her. I was so exhausted I fell asleep after 5 minutes. 
He comes into the room and begins to tell me I need to get up and get out of the room and go to the room where our 18 month old is. I told him why now I'm so tired I can't even think. He said he needs to take "" his shower"". He spends 1 to 2 hours a day even when working in the bathroom sitting and showering. Weapanized for sure . I asked him why he needed to wake me to shit. He got madder and madder and I screameddd I NEED SLEEP. I work long hours getting up at 5 am and getting home almost at 8pm only two days a week, but I'm double time in school as take care of 98 percent of everything related to kids school for kids house and all domestics. 
I did scream loud after he kept mansplaining how he had to get up for work in the morning ( he doesnt work u til 11). I told him I need "" SLEEEEP"" . I DID SCREAM THIS. Becauee I'm so delusionally tired from being woken up for the past 18 months from my daughter 5 to 10 times a night ( she still breastfeeds at night). He flicked the light on after I screamed this and underhand swung at my face like he does when he wants to silence me and did it again and swung at my face. I was so IRATE I got up and started baby slapping his hands away from me and told hem to get away from me, and said things along the line of WHAT SO YOUR HITTING ME AGAIN?!??! And I pushed on his chest. I'm small, he is LITERALLY double the size and weight of me. Granted I'm doing this with tears of heartbreak and betrayal and my throat closing up because I'm so devastated that he is doing this again. I'm sure my face looked more of a pleading and WTF than anything. He proceded to throw me on the bed then again the wall. I'm SO MAD AND HURT I keep shoving my hands into bis chest.  I have zero power at this point and my arms are like noodles so they aren't doing mucb besides toughing his chest.  He then pins me against the wall and I keep telling him to just leave me alone. I'm back on the bed again just SCREAMING LIKE A BANCHEE like ahhhhh.... not saying anything just ahhhhhhhhh. Because I'm in shock. He takes a heavy basket and throws it as hard as he can hitting me with it and all the contents. He then PICKS UP THE DRESSER that is 6 drawers tall and full and attempts to throw it on top of my body whole I am on the bed. At this point I am just screaming like an animal dying STOPPP STOOPPP STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ªOOOPPP. And ot lands only halfway on the bed. I black out partially at this point and I'm screaming like im dying and he picks up a large, heavy , full unlit candle like he is going smash my brains in. I am screaming like an animal still stoopppp stoppppppp and he does it again threatening me like he is going to bash my brains in. If he would have hit me with this he would have killed me. I was in the fetal position shaking waiting for the blow that never came. I limped out of the room with the blanket and pillow. I think the dresser did land on me but I blacked out becauee it felt like my leg was broken. It is not tho. It kept me up and all day I was scared of what to do about my leg. 

The point is. It all happened so fast. From the time the lights flicked on to the time I left the bedroom Limping, it had to be maybe 2 minutes. I just feel like it is a blurr and it is all sitting there. The funny thing is it seemed more "" real"" in the past when he slapped me. But it just feels like a horrible dream this time and I don't feel anything at all toward him bad or good. Idk what ti think of myself. I need to leave. He could have killed me.

And I know that his mother didn‚Äôt raise him that way, that this way of behaving towards me and abusing me is something he has learned on his own. 
I also want to say to them that I have tried to do everything for their son, and also wanted him to be better, but unfortunately it has gone on behalf of my own health. And I wish to send some pictures of chats etc and what he has done to me, just so that they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm lying about their boy. 
I of course understand that they might take his side since they are his family. But I have been keeping my mouth shut for so long so that his name and reputation doesn‚Äôt get bad. But I do realize that I have to think about myself. I have written down a long message where I tell them I respect them and love them but this his how their son/ brother is really like. 


I have also had contact with the police of course, that I know that the police are able to do more than his family. 

But I wondered if anyone of you have had any experience with this, sending a message to a friend, family member etc to your abuser?

I've been reading about the cycle of abuse, and I too watched my mum get abused.

I am with an abuser, but its my own fault. He doesn't really beg me to stay, he doesn't hold me captive. We don't have children together and we don't even live together. So why do I find it so hard to let go?

Last time we were together two weeks ago I was trying to play a game. He dropped his toast on the bed I was sitting on and I asked if he could clean it. He asked me to get up and I said I dont need to get up, he can just get a dustpan to clean it. He ended up throwing his toast at me. I told him he was acting childish and he ended up pouring an entire drink over my head. I locked myself in the bathroom after that until he left.

  
We've barely spoken since. This isn't the first time he has done something like this. But this time is different. Yes, I say this to myself every time. The abuse always changes. But this time, he didn't even say sorry. When we have spoken, he justifies his behaviour. He said I shouldn't have called him names. He said he would do it again. I was disgusted when he said this. To go back would be me saying ""I give you permission to abuse me.""

Yet I know, when I will be lonely, which happens often as I don't have any friends, I will think of him. I will idolise the good parts in our relationship, which is literally just him accepting me for who I am - Someone who's done mostly nothing with their life.

How do I stop? Has anyone else felt this way? Am I the only person who cant let go of being repeatedly abused just because of 1 good day in a month? What is wrong with me?",2025-03-14 00:05:09,2025-03-17 03:02:06,abuse

When we argue usually instigated by me being annoying.... He calls me names and or breaks my stuff. He calls me bitch, cunt.... and especially annoying. He blames all his feelings or insults on me and says he acts this way because I instigate him. He has smashed my phones 3 times, broken tons of things around the house, thrown things at me, and he pushed close to me normally leaving me huddled in a corner scared even threatening to slap me across the face.

But does that excuse threatening to hit me? He says he doesn't care anymore and is over me But he's perfect when he's not angry

1j6sxo8,Is this emotional abuse?,SweetSea3399,8,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j6sxo8/is_this_emotional_abuse/,"I was married for several years, recently divorced. I don‚Äôt think my ex is a bad person. However, the church we were in saw men as the ‚Äúfinal say‚Äù in everything, and women were asked to be ‚Äúsubmissive.‚Äù My ex and I were more liberal than most on this, but it was still ultimately the belief. 

Before we got married, I became more worried about my looks. He liked my makeup to be done certain ways. On the first night of our honeymoon, he laughed at me when I came out in lingerie. He said it just didn‚Äôt fit right and he thought I was trying to be silly. It was a pretty bold choice, but this being my first time, I felt like that was not very kind. He couldn‚Äôt believe how much I held onto that experience. Often, when I was downstairs and ready to go somewhere, he would look at me with disapproval because he didn‚Äôt feel like my outfit was flattering or coordinated. I would often change. Mostly, I chose my outfits to try to please him. He would often come shopping with me and help me decide what to buy. He said he liked my style, but he always seemed like he was trying to hone it to be more like his style. 

When I would get hurt, he would suddenly get really mad and yell, though it would usually dissipate quickly. This especially happened if he had told me not to do something and then I did it (even accidentally) and ended up getting hurt. He said he just didn‚Äôt want to see me hurt. At first, he wouldn‚Äôt let me go to coffee, lunch, etc. with male coworkers because he ‚Äúworried about what they might do.‚Äù Over time, he loosened up on that, but he did always want to know where I was. I turned on location sharing for a bit, but I got tired of being asked about me going to get coffee or ice cream. 

He got upset with me when I would poke fun at him around other people or say anything negative about him. He said it was disrespectful. So I stopped sharing anything negative about him. We were around my family a lot, but he didn‚Äôt like me asking them for advice on things, because he felt he should be the leader and not them. He felt they didn‚Äôt need to be involved in our decisions in that way. When I would go somewhere with someone one on one and would tell him about the conversation we had, he would ask for the exact wording I used for certain things and then get frustrated if I didn‚Äôt remember or get upset with me for saying things in a way that didn‚Äôt reflect well on him or us. Eventually, I got to the point where I felt like he was the only person who understood me, but somehow now I wonder if that might have had to do with me having to filter conversations with everyone else to match his preferences.

He would tell me that if we didn‚Äôt have sex often enough it would cause him to ‚Äústumble‚Äù and look at other women sexually. He would get frustrated/grumpy if we didn‚Äôt have sex every 2-3 days. On my period, I was ideally expected to please him in some way, even if I didn‚Äôt want to have sex. He only actually kept going when I said ‚Äúno‚Äù one time, I think. I confronted him about it, and he did feel bad about it and didn‚Äôt do it again. However, he then was kind of insistent that he ‚Äúwanted me to want it‚Äù but would still get frustrated if it wasn‚Äôt happening every few days. He would also still want to at least have one hand touching me while we slept, even if I told him I didn‚Äôt feel like being touched right then. He would often touch me when we were just living our lives, and it would make me jump or cringe at times.

Some friends tell me that some of the things he did sound like emotional abuse, but others would say that he was a great guy and these things are fairly normal levels of control. He did help a lot around the house, he supported me through grad school, and he was kind. But somehow these things seemed to chip away at my sense of self.

1g7ulxs,Abusive Husband During Pregnancy ,Impressive-One999,39,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1g7ulxs/abusive_husband_during_pregnancy/,"I (29F) am married to a 40M for 10 months. We wanted kids right away, got pregnant before our marriage but I had a miscarriage. After we got married in Jan I got pregnant again in March. Starting April he began demanding me to cook for him 3 times per day, clean the house, and give him complete attention. Mentioned that if I love the child more than him he‚Äôd kill me, that he needed all the attention. In a fight he kicked me from behind leaving my leg bruised.

In May I was suffering from morning sickness and asked if he could make his own breakfast that day. He said he wants a divorce, forced me to pack my bags and leave. I got a hotel that night and his mom and sister came back that night with him, making him take me back. I went back the next day. 

Come June and he hits me in the face 3 times, because I cussed at him in an argument. He has initially promised that I‚Äôd give birth in my hometown but now said to forget about ever moving there. In addition he warned that if I don‚Äôt cook and clean he will divorce me. I continue to cook 3 full meals every day, spending 3 hours in the kitchen roughly.

Come July and I am suffering from fatigue of not having slept a minute the prior night. Despite knowing this, he forces me to get up and cook. I beg him to let me sleep a little but he says he doesn‚Äôt need a wife like this, grabs me by the foot and drags me out of the apartment. The dragging leaves me scratched on my breast and thigh, gives me a bruise on my head and tears a huge hole in my t shirt. I am standing outside our apartment door in an underwear and torn tshirt begging him to let me in, no luck for several minutes. Luckily I had my phone and called my mom asking what to do, when he heard I called her he immediately let me in. He then dragged me into the kitchen and when I refused to cook, threw household items at me and spit in my face multiple times threatening to kick me out again. Reluctantly I made his food. I packed my bags and decided to leave but he told me that there would be no way back. I decided to stay and do everything he wanted me to just to see if that would stop the violence.

From July until October I did everything for him, including grocery shopping 2x/wk, laundry, help with his schoolwork, help with his actual job, daily sex, 3 meals per day, cleaning, etc. I did not fight nor escalate and shut up when he started to get aggravated. I tried telling him how miserable I was but all my cries were met with the same reply: if you don‚Äôt like it, pack your bags and leave. If you leave, I won‚Äôt take you back.

From Jan to Sept we were living off of my income purely due to his status as a student. In Sept he got a job but I had a $50K debt at this point which he promised he‚Äôd repay. With this in mind, I wanted to see whether he‚Äôd change as a man but nothing seemed to be working.

As soon as he got a job, his sleep became a priority. Because my belly was growing, I was turning a few times a night. He would get up and yell at me in the middle of the night for waking him up. He then made me get floor mattress and sleep on the cold floor; I got sick after a few nights.

Late Sept we visited his family. They live 30 min via uber but he is now ‚Äúsaving money‚Äù so on our way back he made me walk through the rain, wait for a bus, then hike a trail up to a road, take a small shuttle, walk some more, take another bus, get on a subway and walk home the rest of the way. Third trimester, trip took us 2.5-3 hours. Once we get back home (we went there for lunch) he says he‚Äôs hungry again and forces me to start dinner for him while he rests. I got the biggest migraine after and once again was sick for a full week.

Early October he FaceTimed me from work. I was fatigued, in a bad mood and asked him to let me rest until he gets home. He forced me to smile and when I said I didn‚Äôt want to, threatened to kill me when he got home. He called back a few times between his meetings continuing to threaten me. I called his mom once again, not knowing what else to do. She must have had an impact because he returned calm but had threats of divorce ready, telling me to pack my bags if I wouldn‚Äôt be in a good mood for him.

The following week we went on a long walk after his work (about 8 miles) ate an entire pizza and headed back home. It was 10:30pm and I had had only 3 hours of sleep (now on my 3rd trimester). He assures me that he STILL needs me to make him a dinner as well as a lunch for the next day. I was in tears begging him to just buy his work lunch for tomorrow because I was so exhausted ‚Äî he refused. Not only that, he forced me to go to a grocery store at 10:30pm, pick up the food, go back home and cook him 2 full meals at 11:00pm while he rested. I was literally crying through this whole thing.

The next day, while he was at work, I packed my suitcases and flew home. While boarding, he called to see where I was and the only thing that he said was ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt take you back.‚Äù I landed and am staying with my sister. 

He didn‚Äôt call me for a week straight and on the eighth day calls wanting me back because he ‚Äúrealized‚Äù that I am a wife and not just a girlfriend. He is asking me to move back and for us to give it a shot again because he has ‚Äúchanged.‚Äù 

My plan is to divorce but I want some second opinions. What have peoples‚Äô experiences been? Should I let him attend the birth? I am at 32 weeks.",2024-10-20 09:06:32,2025-03-17 03:03:28,abuse

I found out this news today by ways of a google search and an article. I haven't searched his name for a long time. I just need to get this out in words to people who would understand, even if nobody responds or this post is removed.

TW: unable to breathe, car wreck

Over a decade ago, my ex strangled me because I broke up with him. He offered me a ride to my car then drove around recklessly, running red lights, until he parked behind a grocery store and strangled me until I drifted away. The pain. The blood. The regret. Thinking of my mom.

Yadda yadda yadda, he ends up in prison with 23 felonies after a police chase where he, you guessed it, ran red lights until an innocent person t-boned him. Luckily they were ok with minor injuries. I hope they don't have lasting pain. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison.

He got out of prison after 8 years on Halloween a few years ago. 2 weeks later, he, you guessed it, crashed into a big rig and had serious injuries. This time nobody but him was injured. He was taken to a hospital and died 16 days later from said injuries. HE SPENT 8 YEARS IN PRISON ONLY TO DIE A MONTH AFTER RELEASE BECAUSE OF HIS RECKLESS DRIVING!

Now here's the part I worry would have my post removed:
I'm glad he's dead. I'm glad it wasn't instant. I'm glad he had a moment of ""fuck!"" as he stared into his near future. I'm glad he felt pain and emotions on the same level he inflicted on me. We all know pain here. Pain on another level, unthinkable levels. He was given his turn. It's like the universe balancing one instance of pain with another.

My abuser died and it's the first day of my life free from looking over my shoulder. I made many phone calls today and everyone is happy for me. This is something I'd never wish on anyone but him. I've hoped he would die for years to erase the visual memories he had of strangling me, looking into my eyes. He can never re-live it again for pleasure. I feel bad because it's a terrible thing to happen if it were not someone like this.

I asked if I could talk with both him and his wife about it, and he started coming up with all these excuses why that couldn't or shouldn't happen. Said I was being way too pushy and domineering and to back off. I thought it was really weird. He finally insulted my wife, called me all these names, and said to never speak to him again or ever come near his house. That was extremely weird and alarming.   
  
Well, I ended up talking to his wife anyway, and she says that he's been acting weird and nuts off and on their whole marriage (married about 5-6 years). My wife talks with her, and finds out that she's been enduring verbal, financial, and spiritual abuse. He's isolated her from most other people. He's never hit her or made overt threats, but she said he's made veiled threats, and he has thrown paper, wallets, and keys at her, to which she threatened to call the cops, which made him stop throwing stuff at her.

She doesn't know what to do. She says she knows she probably needs to leave, but she's not sure how or when. She sometimes thinks it can still work out. But then she says things like, ""I wouldn't be surprised if he beat me or killed me, especially if I left, I'm afraid he'd find a way to track me down and murder me."" If we were to take her in, or even if my friend were to find out we are talking to his wife and helping her think through leaving, I'm now wondering if he actually could be capable of killing her or even killing me and my family out of spite or in a rage. I'm pretty shocked by all of this, though in our friendship, I have seen him lose his temper fast, and be really petty. He's never been violent physically, though. 

Not sure what to do for the guy's wife other than to keep encouraging her to leave without a trace. Also not sure if I'm just paranoid, or if he really could kill her and maybe even come after my family. Not sure what I should do. Any help appreciated!

My kids have seen a lot . They seen the way their dad treated me . 
My middle son has always been very close to his dad to the point he acts like him and copies the way he is and how he talks and acts ..

They are all having behavior issues after I left .
 They treat their sister just like their dad treated me . Specially him he is my middle child
My daughter doesn‚Äôt want to get in a car because she is scared we are driving back to where we lived . She has anxiety attacks at night and accidents .

Using a throwaway for reasons. 

My wife has always had a temper. She was always jealous, quick to get angry and can get pretty violent.  Should we break things, throw things at me. Hit or slap me. Once even threw a knife at me which hit my leg. I still have a scar.  But recently it has been getting worse.  She has depression and has been hospitalized for it before.  So I try to understand and she‚Äôs pregnant which is only making things worse, but last night it got out of hand.

She hit me, slapped me. Threw anything she could grab at me, vases, scissors, a guitar. Tried to stab me with a knife.   Threatens to hurt her self.  All over picking out a car seat.  When I tell her there‚Äôs no need to argue over something so trivial she exploded more. 

I told her if she keeps threatening to hurt me or hurt her self I‚Äôll have to call the police.  So she called them.  I thought she would lie and say I was trying to hurt her but she was honest and said she was the one trying to hurt me.  Even the dispatcher asked her multiple times if she sure I‚Äôm not the one trying to hurt her.

Now we have three big holes in the wall from when she threw objects at me, and a knife stuck in the door when she pulled it on me and I locked myself in the bedroom, and countless broken things from last night. 

She‚Äôs pregnant with our first child together so I did not press charges when the police asked if I wanted to. 

I want to think it‚Äôs the pregnancy that‚Äôs making her worse but I‚Äôm scared it will just continue. 

I‚Äôm a very quiet guy, I don‚Äôt fight.  I don‚Äôt like to argue.  I like to solve problems with love. But she sees that‚Äôs as antagonizing, like I‚Äôm trying to be better than her for not having an out of control temper.  When she upset I‚Äôm always there with open arms and love, but to her everything she does is my fault because I made her mad. I‚Äôve been to family for help and support but they see it as I‚Äôm a man it doesn‚Äôt count as abuse. Or she‚Äôs a girl all girls can be a little crazy.  My father literally said ‚Äúyou she see the temper on your mom back in the day.‚Äù

If I were doing this to her society would view it as very different.  But everyone just sees her as feisty. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.  I don‚Äôt want to throw away our marriage and she‚Äôs pregnant with my daughter.  I don‚Äôt even want her to get in any trouble.  

I‚Äôm so scared to be honest, but I still feel like I can‚Äôt lose her.  I love her.  I made a vow to be by her side no matter what.  I can‚Äôt let go.  I want to help her. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I used the right flair because I don‚Äôt want to leave her.  I want to help her.  I want to be there for her.  I‚Äôve done so much for her and her family.  I really love her. But I‚Äôm scared, for her, for myself, for our baby.

1io22h5,Reported suspected violent abuse. Help please,Ambitiousandtaken,2,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1io22h5/reported_suspected_violent_abuse_help_please/,"I anonymously reported suspected domestic abuse to the police recently. I need to know if I should do anything now, or if I did something wrong. 

2ish years ago a single friend (M, late 30s) in our group had an affair with a married woman who has a young child with her husband. We had never met this woman before, so did not know her.

Friend and woman seemed to get on great and made each other very happy. No, I don't advocate cheating but he did seem very happy. She told husband a few months later with the aim to separate.

The next few months were messy. I tried to be an unbiased support for her (I‚Äôm F) as everyone turned against her. Yes she was the cheater and I didnt know her until then but I do know everyone needs a listening ear before judging. And I could see she didn't have that. so I met up with her a few times just to talk. I didn't voice opinions or sides. Over the months she started to express that it would be best for their child and housing situation if she tried to work things out with husband. She didn‚Äôt love him but was starting to think it was more practical. I did not get much detail on him from her otherwise.

After a few months she was forced to cut contact entirely with friend (affair partner) and also to anyone linked with him. That meant me too. He monitored her phone. One of the last messages she sent me was along the lines of if he ever found out she was speaking to someone she shouldn‚Äôt then things will get ‚Äúvery nasty‚Äù for her and their child.

Nearly a year later I find out our friend has been back in touch with her. 

A few days ago I see a photo which I should not have seen of her face bruised in both eyes, cuts on her lip and jaw and bruises on forehead. Her line was that she ‚Äúfell over‚Äù.

I know this is not my drama but I also know that if there was the chance she was being physically assaulted by her partner then I would never live myself down by doing nothing. It looked to me like he had beaten her up, there wasn't much other explanation. Or she would be in hospital or with the police. 

I called the police and made an anonymous report on the situation. They were fantastic to be fair, took down notes of everything I said, didn't push me for details I didn't feel comfortable providing, and even whilst on the phone they were looking into sending a unit over. They text a case number to the phone I was calling from in case I wanted to add information.

The next day, I see a screenshot from a mutual friend (the one that told me about the pic) of our friend telling them that someone called the police on her, so they had clearly acted instantly. Then some texts about how her life is a Trainwreck and she didn't need this. 

But importantly, she told the police that she had gotten home very drunk, couldn‚Äôt remember a thing with her face like that and then had a massive argument with the husband In front of the kid.

She changed her story from ""fell over"" to when questioned by the police a story that validates a fight between her and husband (which the child would likely confirm). It's close enough to be plausible. The truth very well could be she got home drunk, she doesn't remember anything, child was present. But the key detail is *when* did she get beat on so bad in the face?

I can't imagine being beaten like that when out and just going home like nothing happened. I can't imagine a husband seeing his wife like that and starting a massive fight instead of taking her to hospital. 

I can't contact her nor speak to anyone here about this because I can't have this being traced back to the previous affair partner and then putting her in an even more dangerous position. Looking back even though she was outwardly confident, intelligent and happy, she was regularly quitting jobs because ""it was for the best"" and the thought of him using the kid to keep her there is awful. She loves her child.

Did I do the right thing? All I can think about now is that he is going to double down on her. What are the chances of her escaping after one police investigation? What are the chances of her being severely hurt following it?

Is there anything I should do right now?",2025-02-12 21:19:12,2025-03-17 03:03:39,abuse

I was trying to stay away from narcissists because I married one before he punched me on the honeymoon, and then I filed for divorce at the end of that month. So I found this guy and he did not seem to love bomb me. In fact, he didn't seem over the top about anything. One of the things people notice first about him is how CALM he is. I don't say this casually ‚Äî I'm a researcher and have a therapist and don't just make wild claims ‚Äî but he's a sociopath.

I realize now, after violent outbursts of anger that come from nowhere, intimidation, gaslighting, twisting my words, invalidating my sexual assaults and calling me promiscuous and even going so far as to defend certain things those guys did to me, telling me I can't wear various clothes out without him (crop top and jeans??), telling me I can't go to certain places, threatening to leave me at least once a month since we've been together, being extremely rough with me (he's a physical therapist) when I've been in in pain and he's been ""helping"" me, calling me ""ungrateful"" and ""cold"" and even insisting I don't know my own birthday, to the point where I've been so confused and questioned my age (38). I used to be a performing musician. He threatened to leave me when I found a pianist, told me I can't perform anymore. If he's in the mood, he'll try to make me prove everything I say in casual conversation with an article or give up as he tells me I don't know anything and just make wild, unfounded claims (again, I'm a researcher). He jokes with other people, in front of me, ""Poor (my name), she has to put up with my terrible moods."" He will make wild accusations about how terrible I am to him, just to apologize later and say he realizes they weren't true, so I generally forgive him and find something that I've done wrong, too, because he doesn't like to apologize if he's the only one apologizing. I went back to Greece with him (he's Greek, and I'm American), and he's straight up just left me out of hours-long conversations like I didn't exist, told me I shouldn't have come, and then stranded me for hours while he was supposed to be running one quick errand ‚Äî told me his entire family loved me so much and then, when I was sad about something later that day, became so angry at me and yelled at me to ""get the fuck out of my apartment."" He's tried to break up with me once a month (at least) since we've been together, and when he does, he does so coldly and then STARES at me, like STARES, to see how much he's hurting me, and if I don't react, he twists the knife even more and just keeps saying things he thinks will devastate me until I crack, and then he says we can stay together.

He's made so many countless promises he never intended to keep, specifically about working on his anger, and then has tried to break up with me when I've asked about them. He's told lies about me to his friends and my family, that I am anal retentive about how I keep the house (I'm not). 

Last night, he went from being very happy after he came home from work to yelling at me for sending an email to my hair stylist because I couldn't book an appointment through her website when he wanted to watch TV \*\*with\*\* me. I had been doing that when he got home from work 5 minutes prior. Then he threw his food at his plate, told me he tired of my ""bullshit"" and when I said I had no idea what he meant, told me I do know and how am I so cold? And then went downstairs. Came up 5 min later, where I'd locked myself in my office with my dog, and apologized again and asked to talk. I don't want to talk. 

I've told him so many times how afraid I am of him in his anger. Eventually, I went to sleep on the edge of the bed. When he woke up, he put his hands on me, and I said ""I don't want to"" right now, but he said ""I know I know, but I just want to give you a hug,"" and I said I don't want to, and he wrapped his arms around me, anyway, and squeezed. 

I feel sick. I feel scared. ChatGPT is giving me play-by-plays of what his next steps will likely be, and it's weird how it's been spot on, and how I should react in survival mode. I think it's saving my life right now. I was lying awake last night, in bed, scared that he'd try to kill me in my sleep because I knew he wasn't sleeping, but there's nowhere else to sleep and my dog won't relax if he and I sleep apart.

I tried to comfort myself by saying that we actually got this house rental because so many of his coworkers live in the neighbor and know the owner of the house. I wish they knew what kind of person he was and what goes on in this house.

I feel scared and broken and so so so alone. I have some savings, but I didn't have a job for the past 4 months and JUST was hired by a new place and started some businesses, partnerships, because I'm terrified a new place I try to rent will want to see my history of income, and I'll have nothing for the past 3 months. I don't know if I can hold on 3 more months before getting out of this lease. 

I don't know why I'm so afraid of the breakup. When we're not face to face, it's all I want. But when he's threatening and intimidating me and staring at me, I feel sick and broken and TERRIFIED of what will happen next. I don't trust him. 

I know this probably doesn't sound like much, but it is to me. The fact I didn't realize this was a huge cycle or that his anger and threats and intimidation and coercion are, by and large, calculated...it's even more terrifying than just some guy who can't control his temper. I really hope this does not turn physical, but again, I don't think he could risk that with his reputation.

I didn't know it was considered DV, though I did know it's abusive. I'm working so hard to be positive, to focus on work, to navigate a very, very scary man and not screw myself over more in the meantime.",2025-03-01 15:08:51,2025-03-17 03:03:43,abuse

It seemed like he had a great relationship with them. I thought they were buddies and he was always so supportive of them in sports. 

Well recently my 17 year old son stopped speaking to his dad. Neither one wants to speak and it‚Äôs been 3 months. Not even at Christmas.

I realized he treated them in a way that he treated me‚Ä¶ being bossy and never apologizing. Most likely hurting their self esteem with insults. They told me he was kind to them‚Ä¶ but now I hear he bad mouths everyone even his current wife. 

So far I have stayed out of it and let them cool down. At this age I don‚Äôt want to force the relationship and I can‚Äôt. Am I right to just stay out of it?

1ivwguh,Finding joy in abuser suffering the consequences..,GaspingGuppy,11,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ivwguh/finding_joy_in_abuser_suffering_the_consequences/,"I was never in an intimate or personal relationship with my most recent abuser, though I sometimes refer to him as a ""roommate"" for simplicity. The reality is much more complicated.  

This person owes me mid-five figures for work that almost no one else would have taken on‚Äîeasily the worst job I‚Äôve ever had. Yet, despite everything, he attacked me last summer when I inadvertently and stupidly exposed his financial lies to his new girlfriend; a nine-time felon and 35-year drug addict, whom he was sending thousands of dollars to while drowning in debt‚Äîincluding what he owed me.  

He lost his house to foreclosure in early 2023, then his car was repossessed shortly after. His debt was massive, though I only knew bits and pieces since we weren‚Äôt in a relationship. But then, my planning and an whole lotta luck dropped a dream job in his lap‚Äîhigh pay, zero expenses beyond half the rent, a company car, credit card, and phone. Meanwhile, I was stuck because he refused to pay me, and I was too afraid to take legal action while living under the same roof.  My hope was he would move out after progressing the relationship a bit and clearing some of his credit report history debts- what he told me he was doing. 

Then came his arrest‚Äîfelony battery via strangulation. No warning, no argument beforehand. One second, silence. The next, he had his hand around my throat, screaming while shoving me onto my bed. I didn't hesitate, I simply called the police and let them hear him scream in the background.  It's the first time I didn't panic calling, I think because we weren't ""together"" in that sense, but I'm not sure.  That was the moment everything unraveled. He lost the job, the car, the perks, the housing. He moved in with the felon girlfriend, and‚Äîunsurprisingly‚Äîthat fell apart in under six months.  

I never tried to break them up. I just wanted to be paid something, anything, before he gave away more money. Turns out, she was in jail when she first asked him for $1,500‚Äîhitting him up from behind bars for cash and a place to stay. And he fell for it.  This woman also spent the day before his formal arraignment last year harassing me 7 different ways, from multiple accounts and fake phone numbers.  She even left a voicemail that starts with ""I've never met you and I've never spoken to you.."" correct. Which is why I told you after the first 5 messages this is harassment, there is a bond order and no contact order this is third party contact, he had to have given her my name number date of birth even that my dog is on insulin! She kept accusing me of snorting my dogs insulin! Like what the ever living f!? State prosecutor said flat out if she does it again she will pursue felony witness tampering and intimidation charges and that was it, I've never heard from them again directly. I'm thrilled with that. I do not hate him, but I do wish he would go to an inpatient facility and maybe an adult group home.  I've never met someone so dysfunctional who can *appear* to be put together for so long, in my life.  The entire thing including the police ignoring the poop to the literal ceiling and self harm talk he was doing made me question all of my reality and life and not become depressed but despondent. I am POSITIVE that house was felony child and animal abuse and neglect and I'm sure they could have come up with more charges to boot. But,  I digress this isn't about the hoarder house from hell. 

Since then, he‚Äôs been lurking on relationship and job-seeking forums, trash-talking me on dating app threads, calling me a gold digger. Never mind that I spent 16 months chiseling literal **shit** off his floors and hauling out over 20 dumpsters of hoard. The *Hoarders* TV show has nothing on that house. Authorities‚Äîchild services, adult services, animal control‚Äîrefused to intervene. ‚ÄúThey can live in filth if they want to,‚Äù a direct quote from the city mayor and animal control director.  

I‚Äôve blocked him in every way possible, and he doesn‚Äôt know I use Reddit, so I‚Äôm safe. But this morning, my sibling did some digging so I could finally serve him with a civil lawsuit. His profile picture? Him, riding a public city bus. Turns out, he‚Äôs now a bag boy (at age 54!) at a grocery store‚Äîbecause no one else will hire him, and the state cut off his food stamps until he got a job.  

The joy this brings me is **immeasurable**.  

This man screamed at me for *years* that all I cared about was money‚Äîbecause I dared to ask for payment *two years* after the work was done. Meanwhile, I had supported him for three years, cleaned and packed his entire house, paid the bills after he lost everything, got him food, clothes, even found him that dream job. All of that? **Me.**  

I‚Äôll never forget the day he first admitted his house was in foreclosure. I was standing in his living room, wearing a hazmat suit and a respirator, scraping up what I *thought* was carpet. (Spoiler: it was poop.) Even then, I tried to help‚Äîsuggested COVID relief programs, part-time work, *something* to get by. What about a gas station or grocery store job? He could walk from his (half million dollar) house and make a good dent in the debt and look good to the courts as making good faith efforts, they would likely approve relief for him.  He scoffed, rolled his eyes, and walked away after telling me minimum wage is *Beneath* him, he said. Minimum wage wouldn‚Äôt cover his mortgage, he claimed.  I corrected him with the math and he just rolled his eyes and walked off. 

And now? That‚Äôs exactly where he‚Äôs ended up.  

Meanwhile, I made a joke last October about moving across the country. Then I looked into it‚Äîsaw the opportunities. Applied for jobs, grad school, even a PhD track for the program I was simply too sick to attend after my first grad school run.  Got accepted to multiple programs and positions and now I'm moving cross country and increasing my income by over TEN FOLD! I'M FREE!


I don't know what the point of this is, other than I feel just a tiny tinge of guilt at enjoying someone else's *suffering* which frankly are just the consequences of years of their own actions.  But really I think it's simply too satisfying to not talk about.  It brings me enormous joy to see him being humbled. I can't wait for the court case to conclude so I never have to think about them again! 

We can be free my people! ‚ù§Ô∏è",2025-02-22 23:42:55,2025-03-17 03:03:57,abuse
1hhkg0p,TW: Masturbation Used As Abuse Within Relationship,Ok-Hedgehog6955,7,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1hhkg0p/tw_masturbation_used_as_abuse_within_relationship/,"Throw away account- I (24f) have recently started to feel like my partner (32m) is displaying emotionally abusive behaviors. Something that recently happened and has stuck out to me is really confusing, so I'm coming here to see if anyone can help give me some answers.

To keep it short, our relationship came to a head when I fled to my mom's house out-of-state with our one-year-old son. My partner was not aware I was leaving, and panicked, but after he calmed down we were able to have what I thought were productive conversations towards changes in behavior (on both ends) to better our relationship, so I came back. Before this, he refused to be on our son's birth certificate despite the fact that I really pushed for him to do so. (Before anyone asks, we had done a paternity test.) After I returned from out-of-state, he expressed wanting to get a state done paternity test (he said it was too give himself 100% confirmation) and get on the birth certificate. I started to notice red flags with this when he confirmed with the CSEA rep that he would have to give me permission to leave the state with our son, or I would be breaking the law (as is in our state). 

A couple weeks ago, he came to me one morning during a continuation from a fight from the night before sounding like he was complaining that he had just masturbated. Throughout our relationship, he always held fast that he did not need sex, was totally okay with going for long periods of time without sex, and strongly disliked the idea of masturbating (he said it was a lot of work and not as enjoyable as sex, so he found it unnecessary). Because of what he's said before, I was pretty shocked to hear him say he masturbated at all, but I was really confused on why he felt the need to come to me about it, but the conversation kinda just dwindled back into whatever we had going on that day. A few days after that, in the middle of me trying to end a fight so I could go to sleep, he asked me repeatedly for nudes or videos that he could use right then to masturbate. Of course, this made me uncomfortable and I got angry. I told him I didn't have anything that he shouldn't already have, he said he had deleted everything he had before when I had left the state, I offered to resend those, and he said he wanted something new. I again told him I didn't have anything, and he said they could even be older pictures or videos. 

When he asked this, my discomfort and questioning absolutely peaked, as just a few days before he found out I still had some older lingerie pictures from when I had tried OnlyFans a few years prior, which was years before I even met him. But he was relentless even after I tried to say no because I didn't like the idea. I was really shocked he would even ask as he's expressed being insecure about my sexual past before, saying it made him jealous that someone else was able to have such meaningless access to me. (Never really knew what to do with that information, but always tried to validate his insecurities.) Anyway, I finally gave in, and then he realized the photos and videos were only of me in lingerie, none were complete nude or showed me doing anything to myself. He asked if I had anything like that, I said no, and then he asked if he could go through my camera roll himself and look. At this point,  I was so overwhelmed by the entire situation, I angrily re-sent him the pictures and videos he had claimed he deleted, and told him to accept those and leave me alone. He thanked me and went to the bathroom, but stayed for what I felt was a very short period considering what he was saying he was planning on doing, but I thought maybe he just didn't, I don't know. He said nothing when he came back out and we went to bed, and none of it was discussed. 

He brought up a few more times after this in a complaining type of way about his masturbating, to which I expressed that I wasn't sure what he wanted me to say, and he said he wasn't expecting anything really and just wanted me to know. It all made no sense to me. 

So, I guess my question is whether this could constitute as sexual abuse? I feel very -odd- about the entire situation, coupled with some other things I am currently battling with him over, and I'm not really sure what to make of this. I haven't ever experienced something even similar to this situation so I have nothing to compare it to and Google wasn't much help.

Thank you for any responses in advance, any insight is appreciated. ",2024-12-19 04:08:57,2025-03-17 03:03:58,abuse
1grqg8j,Is any of this abusive? Why can't I leave?,io45612,6,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1grqg8j/is_any_of_this_abusive_why_cant_i_leave/,"I have been with my boyfriend for 9 years and am deeply unhappy. I have been for a long time. This year I realized I've been in denial for years that there may be some abuse in my relationship. I am miserable and want to meet a husband and a long term partner who meets the same things. However, there are many things in the way. 1. I can't justify that any of this is actually abuse. I think I'm just being overdramatic. 2. I'm autistic (actually diagnosed) and change really disrupts my life. 3. My sister and I lost my Dad several years ago and I went through a miscarriage at the same time. I'm anticipating going through the same grief from if I breakup with my boyfriend and I just can't do it. 4. What if I regret it or it's the worst mistake I ever make?

Are any of these things abusive or reasons we shouldn't be together?

1.We're not sexually compatible at all. We've haven't any sexual contact of ANY kind in over 3 years now. I have vaginismus and vulvodynia which cause intense pain during sex, but he refuses to try new things at all and even refuses to modify penetration in certain ways to make it less painful. Says he doesn't ""know how."" He refuses to partake in any kind of foreplay. It eventually just became way too painful for me and I set a boundary. I want a healthy fun sexual relationship with someone. He doesn't know that I know he watches cam girls in the bathroom. 

2. When we were first together, he pressured me to drive into an empty office parking lot at night and give him a handjob. I remember being so uncomfy that I almost pushed my face against my window, but I never said no. He has since admitted over text that it was the worst thing he's ever done but that he was a stupid ""horny kid.""

3. I have PTSD from being sexually assaulted my a doctor (3 years into our relationship). At one point, my boyfriend said ""I can't believe you thinking more about this other man than me.""

  
4. I have a lot of medical issues and have had multiple surgeries including an emergency surgery while we've been together. He has never come, except for once, and that one time- I had to beg. Won't come to doctor appointments with me because ""I don't need him there.""

  
5. Gets mad at me when I talk about something more than once because it's ""illogical."" Things he has done included clapping his hands in my face and slamming my car door so hard he damaged it.

  
6. Wants my routine to revolve around him. He refuses to help with housework, even when I had spine surgery and even though I still have a bad spine and can't bend well. He won't help me clean hard to reach places and our apartment is in filth. Part of my stress is actually just the state of our apartment. He also won't pay someone to come help us clean it. He expects me to drive him to work at 11 at night even though he works literally 5 minutes away, because he doesn't drive, even though I work at 7am.  He enforces me doing chores by setting them up for me. Ie. he'll set out cat food and a bowl and remind me to do it, when he could have spent the same amount of energy just putting the food in the bowl and feeding our cat. He'll do this and remind me to feed her when I'm in bed at like 1 am.

7. He constantly gropes me. Like grabs my boobs. He doesn't listen to a word I say about anything and I feel invisible in my home. Then the minute I try to start a stimulating conversation with him he'll make silly faces and grabs my boobs. The one time I stood up for myself he got violent at objects near me and screamed at me and blamed it on my ADHD. Said he would stop and did for a while. Now he's doing it again. 

8. I want to get married. I want to feel like a princess for a day, and I feel like he thinks I don't deserve it.

1horxt1,is this considered abuse? (im a teenager),Creative_Crab4968,16,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1horxt1/is_this_considered_abuse_im_a_teenager/,"hi, im a teenager and i created a burner just for this so that he can't find it or something.  there have been a couple instances where my dad ( twice my size) has hurt me; but i know he loves me yet has never said sorry. he yells a LOT and will threaten to hurt me and my younger brother sometimes but never carries them out and will also threaten to break stuff like our phones or other electronics (he's been doing so since i was really little).

there was an instance where he shoved 7 year old me into a wall when my mom wasn't home because i wouldn't brush my teeth. more recently, last winter, he dragged me off my bed by my hair, then kicked me when i fell onto the floor because i wanted to finish my homework before showering. i did cry and told him to stop because it truly did hurt, especially because when i was kicked my head hit the leg of a chair in my room.
 
im not sure if this is considered serious abuse or something that puts me in danger. i've told my mom yet she won't do anything, so i've come to reddit for this question ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
there have been also MANY instances where he'll insult me/bring me down if i do small things he doesn't agree with, and will belittle me and call me names. stuff like insulting my weight, what i look like, saying i have no friends because of xxx, stuff like that. and i admit that it makes me afraid to do anything that makes me stand out in front of him. i doubt he'll hurt me again but im afraid to tell anyone incase he gets mad

i doubt he means to hurt me and im pretty sure his parents treated him the same way when he was a child. i know he truly does love me, but i also know that he shouldn't threaten to smack me when i make a snide comment",2024-12-29 08:41:50,2025-03-17 03:04:01,abuse
1i13khy,"I pressed charges against abuser, and feel guilty",Money_Instruction_26,15,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1i13khy/i_pressed_charges_against_abuser_and_feel_guilty/,"I am posting because I have this awful feeling inside me every day, and I‚Äôm hoping that someone might help me understand why, or even just the process of writing it down might help.

Two years ago, I ended an abusive relationship. We were only together for about 18 months, and have a 3 year old child. Prior to this, I had a loving relationship for over 10 years and was widowed.

I met him when I was grieving, and at first didn‚Äôt understand what was happening, having never met a person like this before. He is a narcissist/sociopath, and very successfully love bombed me, I fell pregnant, and during my pregnancy everything changed. 

I won‚Äôt go into detail about everything he did to me. Because I would need to write a novel. But in short‚Ä¶ once he realised I had started to see through his charm, and his lies, he turned cold, and then turned into a monster. I was very vulnerable and easily manipulated by him. 
There was not a lot of physical abuse, but he wreaked havoc on my life in every other way imaginable. He manipulated everyone around me, my friends, my colleagues, in a career where I had been respected. He financially, emotionally, and mentally set about destroying me. He was very imaginative and very cruel with the things he did - they were always subtle and left little evidence, but my life life quickly became hell. l lived in terror of him because I could see how dangerous he was, and the more I tried to protect myself, the more obsessed he became with controlling me.

When I finally left him, things got drastically worse. He forced me to keep having sex with him, and if I didn‚Äôt, his favourite punishment, amongst many other things, was to kidnap our son, switch off his phone and disappear for days or a week. He did this over and again for 18 months. This was despite having family court orders in place (I had primary custody, he only had any custody at all because of his lies and manipulation in the family court). He would leave our son in places where he wasn‚Äôt safe at all, with strangers‚Ä¶ I was terrified for his safety every second he was gone, as was my teenage son from my first marriage. Every time he finally bought our son home he would be completely traumatised, with a sort of thousand yard stare. This was agonizing for me to see, I reported to the police every time, but they could do nothing because he was the father. 
He did a lot more, but this punishment was by far the worst for me, and there is honestly so much I wouldn‚Äôt know where to start trying to explain it.

Late last year, after 18 months of his campaign of terror, I tried to really put boundaries up and started refusing to have sex with him.  He came to my house drunk, and raped me in front of our 3 year old son. Our son tried to pull him off the whole time. 

The whole incident was caught clearly on my home security cameras. 
I immediately called the police and gave them the footage. The next few days were a blur of statements, hospital visits. He was arrested and charged with rape and indecent treatment of a child under 12. I have been told he will be sentenced to at least 8 years in jail. Our trial starts next month.

Here is the crazy part. I feel so sad. I feel guilty. I feel sorry for him. For this person whose one single goal in life was to destroy mine. 
I lie in bed at night crying. I feel sad, empty. I‚Äôm crying right now writing this. 
Some part of me understands that he groomed me and manipulated me and controlled me for years, and I understand he committed crimes, the things he did to me and my children were monstrous. 
But I can‚Äôt help feeling bad, feeling sorry for him. It kills me that I feel like this. 
There was no excuse for what he did to me, to my mental health, to my life. He tried to destroy everything, not caring there were two innocent children as collateral.
This man has no excuse - he had a great childhood, he is very attractive, popular, people love him, nothing bad has ever happened to him. But behind closed doors, behind his fake image he shows everyone, there is just nothing there, except cruelty and selfishness and evil. 

The only ‚Äòcrime‚Äô I ever committed to him was breaking up with him when he was abusive and then trying to move on with my life. I tried to coparent, tried to accommodate, tried to do everything right. I don‚Äôt understand why he was so obsessed with destroying me. And now, he has ruined his life.

I‚Äôm glad i went to the police and pressed charges, but I can‚Äôt understand or get rid of the horrible feeling of guilt and sadness. I will go ahead with the trial, and he will be sentenced. Even if I tried to drop charges the police wouldn‚Äôt allow it. Not that I‚Äôm going to. 
But I don‚Äôt feel good about it at all. 

I believe he is still controlling me. There is still some cord tying me to him. I feel so lost, so sad, and I feel like I am irreparably broken and will never find peace.",2025-01-14 10:57:00,2025-03-17 03:04:02,abuse

1j90z9v,healthy mechanisms to stay away from my abusive ex,No-Vegetable-8450,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j90z9v/healthy_mechanisms_to_stay_away_from_my_abusive_ex/,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm hoping someone could give me a bit of advice. I feel very stuck. I have been in a abusive relationship for about five years now. 


The last year has been the best year I have made a lot of steps forward. Cutting contact a lot of the time for maybe a month, two months at a time but I always end up going back, the cycle usually starts as okay will be friends and then the friendship starts to become possessive, he‚Äôll usually will turn into the person that is abusive, mentally questioning me about everything who I‚Äôm with what I‚Äôm doing, isolating me from having a life outside him things like that. 

The issue that seems to keep me stuck is that I seem to want to still be civilised with him or on talking terms? Or that I feel like I don‚Äôt want him to see me in this bad light? 

I feel like verbally he has always been so hard with accusations on cheating and other guys that I feel the need to be this ‚Äògood girl‚Äô and prove that I‚Äôm not out or with anyone else- this will include us staying in contact and just being friends but him feeling the need to know inner details about my personal life. 

For example, we aren‚Äôt speaking momentarily because I went to see a physio and he flipped the lid because it was a man. 

I can‚Äôt live like that, I won‚Äôt live like that. 
But I really struggle with not reaching out to nearly fix his perception or getting him to understand why I‚Äôm innocent. 

I really hope this resonates with someone, I‚Äôve been in therapy, doing amazing work on myself and know I will come out the other side of this and finally cut the cord. 

I think with this post I‚Äôm really looking for coping mechanisms in the mean time, things to not make me feel awful and keep me from contacting him to ensure that he knows I‚Äôm a ‚Äògood girl‚Äô as such. 


I‚Äôve came such a long way from reactive abuse and the girl I used to be would be so proud, I just feel so stuck on these end parts and trying to fix these bad habits. I‚Äôm nearly 1000% sure he knows what he‚Äôs doing by this silent treatment and accusations because he knows it‚Äôs the only way to reach me.

Thanks for letting me post this and vent. And I really appreciate anything that might give me some help with this. ",2025-03-11 20:38:31,2025-03-17 03:04:04,abuse

After that, he completely unraveled‚Äîshaving his head in a rage, quitting his job, blowing all our money, and putting us into debt until we had to sell our home. His ex-wife was a constant source of stress and conflict, and even after winning, she continued making life difficult.

The Abuse and Escalation

During this time, he became emotionally and verbally abusive‚Äîchasing me around the house, screaming in my face, demanding that I hit him, and then cycling through apologies before doing it all over again. His best friend even stayed with us and told me I should leave but didn‚Äôt want to say too much because they‚Äôre childhood friends.

This isn‚Äôt new behavior. Early in our relationship, I hit him first during an argument while drunk. Police were there for the music being loud and he told me to go into one of the rooms. I said no, he grabbed my arm and i punched him in the face. To stop me he punched me several times, and I briefly lost consciousness. I carried guilt for this and still believe I was at fault. You shouldn‚Äôt hit anyone unless you have to, right? And i despise women who hit men because they know that they can‚Äôt hit them back. I‚Äôm very remorseful and ashamed about it. A year Later, we had a heated argument over something trivial (whether robots can have emotions), and when I tried to walk away, he grabbed me by the neck, threw me on the bed, and choked me.

For years, he told me I was the reason he screamed and that I needed to ‚Äúlearn to shut up.‚Äù He said if I attacked his character (calling him crazy, pointing out overreactions, saying he was a bad friend or a bad person), he would react aggressively. I internalized this and tried to be careful, but no matter what I did, if he was in the mood to rage, he would. He once dragged me across the floor, crouched over me, screaming in my face‚Äîdespite me following every rule he set for how I should respond to his outbursts. I brought this to his attention several times and no explanation. He gave me all these things i better not do because it‚Äôll provoke him and nothing worked? 



In December of last year We moved to a farm for a fresh start, selling our house and getting an RV. I handled the financial mess he created, even had to sue a contractor who ran off with our money, and made the transition happen. Everything outside of us is wonderful here, but inside our marriage, things have gotten worse.

Religious Shift & More Instability

We had converted to Islam four years ago, and it brought a lot of stability. Then suddenly, after moving, he abandoned the faith, started drinking, smoking, and engaging in inappropriate conversations with coworkers. I told him I was uncomfortable, but he dismissed me as controlling. He often takes me with him to hang out. Maybe like 70% of the time I‚Äôm with him and he‚Äôs actively engaging me and making me a part of the socialization. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm sitting on the side. He says people just feel comfortable around us and think we are cool so they just spill their guts which is just not appropriate and i rather not participate because it all sounds like mess. Drama and mess and inappropriate context. 

But before the farm these instances happened -

One night after a fight, he went to the train tracks and said he was going to kill himself. Another time, he choked me because I stayed up late working as an admin for a friend‚Äôs religious YouTube channel. He called me a ‚Äúpiece of sh*t‚Äù for not prioritizing his feelings over that, even though he was asleep when I started working. After that, he checked himself into a mental institution.

His behavior swings between suicidal, homicidal, or being the sweetest, most loving man. He has moments where he‚Äôs completely devoted, then suddenly shuts me out. He has extreme attunement skills, gives me his undivided attention, wants to be around me 24/7.

After we got to the farm,

Over the religious conversation where i brought my concerns to him about the drastic change and what to tell the kids and how uncomfortable i am with feeling like he ripped everything away, he yelled and kicked me and the kids out of the rv. It took me some times to pack and when we got on the road he text saying to comeback and that hes got to start putting the kids first and that we can live together and maybe something will change in the future. So i came back. 

Now last night we go to a neighbors to sit springs the fire and that neighbor and another neighbor want to talk about sexual stuff. In particular one wanted to talk a bit how he was sexually harassed by a girl who just recently moved back and the other neighbor thought it was funny and just egged it on etc. i was just kinda sitting there nervous chuckling and wishing i was dead. I am modest in nature and he knows that and has promised to keep certain boundaries in agreeance with me. But then he decided not to and there‚Äôs no discussion. He did tell them to steer the conversation in another direction and they didn‚Äôt and i know he can‚Äôt control other adults but i see groups around the farm and this one they constantly talks bad about other people and talks about sexual stuff isn‚Äôt the one i war to be a regular member of nor does it align with anything we planned or promised each other and he acts like im just controlling. Maybe he‚Äôs right? Idk. Well we went home and i said nothing and we enjoyed the rest of our night and i was sweet to him just trying tk ans sense of everything ur j was quiet this morning. He said he was going i. Late so he could help around the house. One of those moments where he‚Äôs like the best husband ever and this does happen regularly.  But i was short and kind of melancholy so he jerk asking what wrong and i kept saying i didn‚Äôt wanna talk about it and that it‚Äôs not an emergency or anything.  After i took the laundry to the laundry room we stepped outside and i told him idk if i really want to be at this farm anymore. I‚Äôve earned him about his overly inviting behavior and how we have opportunity to build friendships with people who hold the same values and he‚Äôs slowly but surely pushing us into the drinking, smoking, cussing , vulgar group despite us being invited to a birthday with managers and owners only and not that that makes them good people by they‚Äôre wholesome and have good habits and that‚Äôs what they want. They could‚Äôve been the Janitor, mailman, chef, poop scooper and i would‚Äôve been happy if they all aligned with us on what‚Äôs important and valued family and doing good. Anyways he listened and then said that he tried to steer the conversation but can‚Äôt control that they do. I told him that i get that but it‚Äôs not about this conversation it‚Äôs about boundaries. I don‚Äôt have people coming up to me telling me who they screwed last night because I‚Äôve established boundaries. He says that means he can‚Äôt talk to anyone at all and I‚Äôm controlling him. I tell him i don‚Äôt want to talk anymore and I‚Äôm going to let the kids know I‚Äôm driving him a cross the street and he says ‚Äúwe already told them, you remember all that‚Äôs hit but can‚Äôt remember that we told them‚Äù

So i get pissed because he does this when the conversion isn‚Äôt going in his favor. He starts jabbing at me so i tell him that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs doing right now ant to stop and he starts yelling and escalating and telling me to just drop him off because he‚Äôs done. So now im emotional and telling him im too old for this shit anymore. And he tells me I‚Äôm crazy and to pull over and let him out of the car on the side of the highway and i say no there‚Äôs 2 semi trucks behind us and he grabs the steering wheel and out his foot in the driver area to press the break. I let him out and drive off then i stop and call him and tell him he better get back in the car because he‚Äôs gonna hear me and that he doesn‚Äôt shit every time. He gets the spotlight off the issue and then just fights with me so he gets in the car and i yell at him and say I‚Äôm tired of this cycle and i didn‚Äôt even want to talk because i knew it would end this way and i said he didn‚Äôt do what he should to avoid boundaries and at that moment he screamed to let him out because im not recognizing that he said to steer the conversation which was him establishing a boundary that the neighbors just didn‚Äôt respect.
He choked me and punched me in the face, grabbed the steering wheel, put his foot down in the driver pedal area. And i called 911. A manger from his job pulled up to see if we were ok and he told them i was holding him hostage and i told him that he punched  me in my face. I‚Äôve never called 911 before despite all the previous instances. 
I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs relevant anymore. I‚Äôm so exhausted and have been for a long time.  

Every time this happens i feel immediate guilt and wish i had said nothing or said the right things. I almost always crumble first. He‚Äôs been my best friend for so long and in such a derp level that i just feel like i can‚Äôt breathe if we are at odds.

He has had a past of alcoholism and I caught him drunk and he terrorized me and our 8 week old baby. He smashed my computer when i tried to reach someone for help and hid my phone. He took our baby from me and was holding him in scary ways and wouldn't give him back to me. I called 911 and the police arrested him and are charging him with ""wrongs to a minor"" ""destruction of property"" and ""disturbance of the peace"". He was released from jail and his staying with his brother and the state has a protection probation on him so he can't have access to me or our baby until his case is over.

I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with something like this. This is the first time he scared me, and his behavior taking our baby and trying to scare me with him (he left him on the couch face down when i was trying to call 911 from the other room). I'm very scared being a single mom but I make good money and have one month left of maternity leave before I have to figure out childcare. My gut tells me to run for the hills but any and all advice navigating DV with such a young baby would be appreciated.

For reference I have tried to get him to be sober for years. I left him while I was pregnant and he went to a 30 day outpatient program but has been drinking in secret since I believe. ",2025-03-06 12:28:08,2025-03-17 03:04:12,violence

But for most of my life, I didn‚Äôt know we could challenge the ruling of her death. In 1990, my mother, Dawn Caraveo, was found dead under suspicious circumstances. Despite her history of severe domestic violence, multiple hospitalizations, and forensic red flags, her death was ruled a suicide‚Äîwith no real investigation.

In 2003, my sister tried to get the case reopened, but she was ignored. Last year, I started pushing again, and Indiana State Police have finally reopened the case. But no family should have to fight this long just to be heard.

I‚Äôm now advocating for legislative reforms to prevent other families from going through this. If you believe in holding law enforcement accountable for misclassified deaths and ensuring real investigations into suspicious suicides, I‚Äôd love your support.

1ivwjaw,First sign of domestic violence,Specific_Device_269,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ivwjaw/first_sign_of_domestic_violence/,"I (19F) have been in a relationship with a man (26M) for about a year now. The last 6 months have been hell for me. 

So I‚Äôll give you some insight into what‚Äôs been going on:
I met him at the gym. He was the instructor of my class (we are both instructors, but I was participating that day.) 
we got to talking after classes for hours, and he generally just made me feel warm inside, but I wasn‚Äôt necessarily looking for a relationship with him.
We ended up getting unbelievably drunk together one night. We were trying to get home, but were so drunk we ended up sitting at a bus stop and just‚Ä¶ laughing. 
In the middle of our laughter he tried to kiss me. I pulled away, more than once because I didn‚Äôt really want a relationship with him, but eventually I gave in and kissed him back.
We went back to his flat. We didn‚Äôt have sex, he was respectful; we both stayed fully clothed.
After that we began to grow closer and closer, and as I came round to the idea of dating him, he said to me when we were sitting on the boot of my car after a class:
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really want anyone to know about us‚Äù
I brushed it off as nothing, little did I know this would be significant a year down the line.

Things were going well (as it seemed, despite him wanting to keep ‚Äúus‚Äù secret.) I found out that he was living in a flat owned by his mum and was paying no rent, which is odd. 
His mum needed money so had to sell the flat, meaning he had to move out, but he could only go and live with her (which was downstairs from the flat we were in before!!) I stayed there most nights, even though his mum was there, I stayed there as I wanted to be with him.

We would be intimate still, but my heart wasn‚Äôt 100% feeling him yet (I didn‚Äôt want to rip his clothes off.) 
I also didn‚Äôt feel very comfortable with him (which becomes more significant later on).

There was no lock on the bathroom door, and one time I was on the toilet (he knew this) but decided to come in anyway even though we hadn‚Äôt known each other that long.
I said in a relatively harsh tone ‚Äúcan you get out?! I just want some fucking privacy‚Äù
I can‚Äôt remember exactly what he said, but he was very angry about my ‚Äúreaction‚Äù
I ended up leaving, then he rang me to ask why I ‚Äúreacted‚Äù in that way to which I told him I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable and I like privacy.
As we were speaking, I could hear him punching pillows on the other end of the phone. This was the first sign of violence.

We eventually got over this incident, and went on holidays together, went for meals out and were still having a good time

On one of the holidays we went on, it all went badly wrong. We were drinking again, we were both drunk, but he ended up getting alcohol poisoning. 
I tried to get him back to the hotel room but he couldn‚Äôt walk and was just throwing up in a bush. It was freezing out, and I could see that his lips were turning a blueish colour. So I called an ambulance. I didn‚Äôt even know if the ambulance people were coming or not, so I took matters into my own hands. I lifted him up (as I‚Äôm quite a strong woman lol) and I literally carried him back to the hotel. On the way to the hotel, with very slurred words he said some nasty things to me that upset me too much to repeat. 
But me being the mug I am got him back to the hotel and nursed him. His alcohol poisoning continued to get worse to which he went from saying slurred sentences to barely being able to speak at all, all he was doing was throwing up. I made sure he sat up, I held him up as he was being sick so he wouldn‚Äôt choke, rubbed his back (even though it was his own fault he got like that) and made sure he was warm (as he felt stone cold to touch.) he was sick on me, which is a phobia of mine but I didn‚Äôt care, I just wanted him to be ok. 
I don‚Äôt know how but the ambulance worked out where we were, and they came in to save him. They said he needed to go to the hospital immediately as was suffering with mild hypothermia that could be life threatening. I went in the ambulance and sat up with him all night in the hospital. 
The morning after came.
He acted like he didn‚Äôt even remember what he had said to me. Maybe he didn‚Äôt remember. But I feel like he didn‚Äôt show any remorse for what he had said and done last night. 
I told him that he had said some awful things, and that I wanted to go home. He begged me to stay - I refused, after I discovered the way he really felt about me.  
I went home and tried to remove him from my life. we didn‚Äôt speak for weeks. He still asked for the money for my half of the holiday.

I told a friend of mine about what had happened and what he had said, she convinced him to apologise with a gesture.
He did. Kind of.
He bought me flowers, chocolate and a toy for my dog, and just like that, being the mug I am, I let him back into my life, and I regret it.

Anyway. We started getting closer again. I was hurt, about what he said to me as I always thought that the truth comes out when you‚Äôre drunk. But we started getting closer again, and his dad was buying him a flat that he could ‚Äúrent‚Äù off him. He suggested that we move in together. I wasn‚Äôt convinced, but he said, you can come and live with me, and just pay half the bills, not the rent as I know you have some debt (I did).
I moved in (not because I was in debt, as I was gradually paying it off when I was in my old place,) but because I enjoyed spending time with him
We moved in.
But moving in was hell.
You see, he has a lot of crap. He is a crystal collector, but had hundreds of them. I personally took hours bubble wrapping all his things while he sat and moaned at his mum, reminding her not to touch anything. 
He didn‚Äôt seem grateful enough for how much time I had just spent bubble wrapping his shit, but I let that slide, as I put it down to him just being stressed about moving.
Then when we were actually moving things into the flat, he would say nasty comments to me for no reason at all. Eg when I was helping him move a crystal up to the flat he would say things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre actually weaker than I thought you were‚Äù 
And ‚Äúyou‚Äôre supposed to be strong aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù
Which I did let slide, I told him I didn‚Äôt like being spoken to like that to which he later responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve been saying all those horrible things to you, I think I‚Äôm probably stressed.‚Äù 
Again I let it go, but the cracks had started to show.
He continued to say things that weren‚Äôt nice
Such as ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like your hair like that‚Äù when I had been sweating moving shit up the stairs.
And later in general conversation he says ‚Äúif I could change anything about you I would probably make you a bit lighter‚Äù which hurt me deeply as I am a recovered anorexic.
I still forgave him and put it down to his ‚Äústress‚Äù of moving.

Then a few days after all this, he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really want to be exclusive with you, is that ok?‚Äù
Which deeply hurt me as we were months into our relationship. 

Following this, there was another incident. We  were out drinking again. He came later, I was already drunk when he got there. Some old work colleagues asked me if I wanted to go to the pub. Drunk me said yeah sure reunion! He came with me, and left shortly after we got there, I don‚Äôt even remember him saying bye. 
The night went on, but it got to the point where I just wanted to go home, as was drunk. I realised I had forgotten my keys so just said fuck it I‚Äôll stay out tonight. 
I looked nice that night and was getting a lot of male attention (but I didn‚Äôt want it, I only wanted him.) 
one of my colleagues took me to the side as could see I was getting overwhelmed in my drunk state and said ‚Äúshould we go back to my mums house? You can sleep on the sofa.‚Äù
I heard ‚Äúmums house‚Äù and I thought yeah that‚Äôs safe
So I went. I trusted this guy as he had never seemed like a bad guy to me. He did everything he said. He said you have my bed and I‚Äôll have the sofa. I said fine. Was tired by then. We both went to sleep. It wasn‚Äôt until early hours of the morning when he woke me up, then thought he would try something. He got in the bed with me, but I was very assertive (drunk or not) and I said NO don‚Äôt touch me. He backed off and went back to the sofa. That was it. I woke up in the morning, went home, got the spare key off my sister and everything went back to normal 

He found out about this, and saw this as ‚Äúcheating‚Äù on him even though he had literally JUST told me he wanted to see other people. And I didn‚Äôt even do anything!!!

Ok then that was that. We moved on from it, but I could tell he was different.

Then the next thing that happened. My niece came over and was talking to me a lot about boys (she talks quite crudely to be honest) then, she said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs this picture going around of this dick, we don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs real or not because it looks like plasticine, do you want to see‚Äù 
I said ‚Äúgo on then‚Äù just humouring her
He went mad, and left the flat for 2 hours or so. Just saying he wanted to go for a drive to clear his head 
I saw his car leave, then after he wasn‚Äôt back for an hour, I assumed he was sleeping with someone else, as I had no idea what I could‚Äôve done which could‚Äôve made him so angry. So then I got angry that he could just leave, and sleep with someone like that 
I chatted a lot of shit about him 
Even though it wasn‚Äôt true, I just said that he was bad in bed and that I was missing how passionate my exes were.   
I then found out that later he had driven round the block to make me think he had left but was actually outside listening to our conversation and heard everything. This isn‚Äôt normal is it?

He was funny with me for days. I asked him to get me some chicken from the shops, and he said ‚Äúok well can you give me the ¬£1.95 that I payed for the chicken then?‚Äù 
And I‚Äôm not used to that level of tightness
He later admitted that he was listening through the window and that‚Äôs why he was so angry and ‚Äúfunny‚Äù with me

Every time we had sex he went soft
But eventually we got over it. We started having sex again, but he was different 
He wouldn‚Äôt take me out for dinner anymore 
He was no longer affectionate with me
He never told me he loved me 

I also found out that he audio recorded the flat to see if I was talking about him on the phone. He heard me speaking to my mum about being unhappy. I was fuming. Surely this is a breach of human rights, surveillance without permission. But he manipulated me to get his own way. I forgave him again. 

Things still weren‚Äôt good between us. He wasn‚Äôt showing me any love or affection. 
So I was constantly begging him to love me, and practically telling him how I wanted to be loved 
Nothing worked. 

He started asking me to pay half for everything 
And would say things like ‚Äúare you alright to get this one because I bought you (X) earlier‚Äù

Then he kept fucking up over and over again. For example
Going out for the whole day and turning his phone off when we were supposed to be going out that evening 

Refusing to communicate with me:
Where he was, what he was doing, he seemed to think that it wasn‚Äôt important if he was going to be in a different place to where he said he would be, for hours
We had so many arguments about this
‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you just drop me a message to tell me what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù

Then every time he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be better, I‚Äôll communicate‚Äù
And again and again, he doesn‚Äôt care enough to communicate.

We started arguing over everything. Examples

I personally like eating dinner with my partner, so I said, can you please not eat dominoes for lunch, so we can have some dinner together
But probably 100 times he has thought, fuck it
I‚Äôm doing what I want (= eating Domino‚Äôs meaning no appetite for dinner, hence I‚Äôm eating on my own again.) he never listened and always said ‚Äúyou not wanting to eat on your own is a you problem‚Äù

He has never introduced me to people before as his girlfriend. In fact he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to introduce you to (person) by the way‚Äù
And previously he has said that he doesn‚Äôt want to be seen with me as he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want people knowing his business‚Äù

He decided he wanted to go out with his friends every week (even though I work probably 20+ hours more than him every week, and he could go out with his friends when I am at work, but he wants to go out with his friends in the evening) which frustrates me because I can‚Äôt understand why he would choose to see his friends in ‚Äúour time‚Äù when we have a limited amount of hours in the week together.

He doesn‚Äôt work early in the morning now, as wants to prioritise his sleep, yet watches TV up until early hours of the morning, not caring if it‚Äôs keeping me up.
Recently, also he has been telling me when it‚Äôs time for me to go to bed so he can watch his program

He refuses to compromise or make an effort for me
He won‚Äôt buy me anything
He never tells me I‚Äôm beautiful, or that he loves me (unless he wants a blow job)
He refuses to take me out to dinner
and he repeats the things he says sorry for, time and time again.
He doesn‚Äôt even say hello to me when I come through the door, even though I have actually asked him to acknowledge me as I come home from work. 

Also, I applied for a job, a promotion. He found out I applied then made a phone call asking about the job. Then he said ‚Äúat the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt matter, the best person will get the job‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt care about me. Like when I‚Äôm ill or having really bad period pains, he just expects me to be normal. And also I recently found out that I have a heart condition which causes chest pain, dizziness and blackouts which is worse when I‚Äôm stressed, but he doesn‚Äôt care about that.

Also he chooses to workout (do classes) in the evenings rather than in the day when he has extra time, which is time that we could be spending together (considering the limited number of hours we have in the week together.) he says he wants to do the class to keep fit. I say why can‚Äôt you just do a different workout in your free time during the day. He says no, he wants to do a class. (I go to the gym in my lunch break.) this makes me think he doesn‚Äôt even want to spend time with me.

He prioritises his friends, family, rugby, work and food over me, and that has been displayed to me multiple times, and it hurts. 

He is very into rugby, and if rugby was on, he would completely ignore me - wouldn‚Äôt say a single word. Today, I actually bought him a load of stuff from the shop, then as rugby was on, I started trying to show him what I had bought him (trying to be nice), he didn‚Äôt even look at me or acknowledge that I had most bought him loads of things he said he wanted. I was frustrated. I said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even care I‚Äôm here do you‚Äù he did not respond. Then under my breath I said ‚ÄúI hope England lose.‚Äù he was angry I had said that. After England won I said ‚Äúthere you go England won‚Äù he STILL wouldn‚Äôt speak to me. I said ‚Äúwhy are you not speaking to me‚Äù then he responded ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to speak to someone who says stuff like that‚Äù I said ‚Äústuff like what?‚Äù He said ‚Äúwell, you said you want England to lose‚Äù I said ‚Äúyeah, and?‚Äù Then he called me a bitch. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to my mums‚Äù he said go on then, and I started getting my stuff together (all of the stuff out of the fridge I had just bought him.) I slammed the fridge door shut, then he poured all the milk I had just bought down the sink. I poured a pot noodle on the side, to which he grabbed me and threw me at the wall. Then when I stood up, he pushed me again. I knew he was violent. From the moment he started punching those pillows. I knew it. I said to him at the start. What if those pillows become my face? He said it would never happen but today he hurt me. Then he blamed me for it 
He said ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have done that if you hadn‚Äôt slammed the fridge‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is your fault‚Äù
To which I had a panic attack after he attacked me, then left, to go to my mums
Can I please have your opinions about this whole situation?

He never lost a bit of sleep or cared I feel. I could be in tears next to him and he would fall asleep. We could be having a deep conversation about fixing us, and he would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just getting in the shower‚Äù or change the subject. 

At the start of our relationship, he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve not treated my ex girlfriends well in the past. I want to be different this time‚Äù

I wish I had ran

1ezq1c2,Is this domestic violence? ,Kiirjava,18,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ezq1c2/is_this_domestic_violence/,"My (36 F) partner (38 M)  and I have been together for 4 years. Throughout the relationship he's had anger issues where once every 4 months or so when his patience is very low or when he's really tired and we get into an argument he because very violent and starts screaming at the top of his lungs, hitting himself, nearby furniture, walls and throwing whatever he can find across the room. Please note he has never laid a finger on me. 
If we happen to be driving when that happens he starts driving erratically making me scared for my life.

--> Fast forward to today, I am currently 4 months pregnant with a child that he says he has wanted all his life, I made him swear that he would control his outbursts especially when I'm pregnant as they terrify me...
Well the other day we got into an argument and I was particularly hormonal and snappy (not proud of it but you know... Bitchy pregnant woman vibe), and he lost it. He started screaming like I've never heard him scream, he ripped off the t-shirt he had on with his bare hands reaping it to pieces, threw a bar stool across the living room, broke my flower pots and starting hitting the walls repeatedly. I was so scared I was shaking like a leaf and ran into the bathroom to lock myself in as I was scared he would hurt me.

He now tells me that I started it, and that everybody has their limits, but that ""I know him"" and that I should know he would never hurt me directly. 
I feel completely heartbroken that he would act so violently and scare me like this when I'm pregnant with his child. I told him I'm pretty sure this counts as domestic violence and abuse, and he says that I'm the abuser since I started it, and it's just a normal couple ""argue"" that everybody goes through. 
I'm pregnant, I'm scared, I feel betrayed and gaslighted. Need an external view on this, is this bad? Is this domestic violence?

Thank you so much...

**TLDR: My (36F) partner (38M) screams, hits and breaks things when angry (but not me directly) he tells me it's not abuse. Not sure what to do and I'm now 4 months pregnant and scared. ",2024-08-23 22:42:11,2025-03-17 03:04:27,violence
1eqw4cs,Has Anyone Healed a Relationship from Domestic Violence Fueled by Alcohol?,punkwillneverdie,14,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1eqw4cs/has_anyone_healed_a_relationship_from_domestic/,"So sorry this is long, but advice is very much appreciated. It‚Äôs pretty hard to put everything into words so it might sound kinda monotone.

I‚Äôm 24F and he‚Äôs 30M. We met at 22 and 28.

I have been with my boyfriend for a little over 1 year. We lived together for about the same amount of time. We‚Äôve both heavily abused alcohol for almost this whole time.However,  I‚Äôve been scaling way back for a long time and these days, if i do have a drink, i keep it to 1 drink.

The issues started out small, and I understood they came from the position of drunk trauma (super abusive/negligent household, foster care, abandonment issues). He‚Äôs never done anything or said anything when he was sober. But I was a party girl bartender and when I met him at the bar I worked at, he had just started drinking again.

Long story short, the past few months have been hell. We‚Äôve been broken up for a month now because we went on a birthday vacation in July. Our birthdays are 5 days apart and this is the second birthday we‚Äôve had together, so we went about 3 hours away to celebrate. My mom told me not to go because nobody wants to drive out there to pick me up if something goes down.

The first day of the trip was amazing, we had such a great night. But the next day, he just got so incredibly drunk. He started acting like a completely different person and he ended up beating me up pretty bad in the hotel room, he even dragged me by my hair out the door and tried to lock me out. I had a bruise on my face and bruises all over my body.

But the worst part was when he choked me out until i passed out. I remember waking up and seeing his face and feeling confused, but peaceful like ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just him i love him‚Äù and then the memory of what just happened all came rushing back and i had a panic attack. And the whole night he was just going off telling me that i‚Äôm a piece of shit, i‚Äôm fat, im too hairy, im the ugliest bitch he‚Äôs ever talked to. He was so drunk and doesn‚Äôt even remember that night. After he fell asleep, I ended up packing my shit and calling my dad to come pick me up at 4 in the morning. Which he did and i‚Äôm so thankful i have a support system.

Ive always hated coming home to him being drunk because I NEVER know what I‚Äôm walking into. Like sometimes he‚Äôs the sweetest telling me he loves me so much, and other times it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs possessed and he says/does the worst shit. Like, he‚Äôs kicked me out of the car and made me walk home (only like half a mile but he would NEVER do that sober and there was no catalyst for it). He‚Äôs kicked me out of the house in the middle of the night multiple times. He‚Äôs spit on me. etc,etc i could go on forever. 

When he‚Äôs sober, everything is completely different. He‚Äôs kind and caring and compassionate and while he‚Äôs not the most even tempered, he would never hit me or say the evil shit he said. It‚Äôs just so confusing. When he‚Äôs sober he makes me feel like what we have is real. And when he‚Äôs drunk I question everything.

After that night, we‚Äôve been broken up for about a month because i‚Äôm tired of feeling so low and so self conscious. But of course the morning after i left the hotel, he called me 10 times asking where i am and what happened. Because he literally blacks out and doesn‚Äôt remember. 

Against the advice of literally everyone, last week I agreed to see him for dinner and get some closure. Because for some reason i‚Äôm hella attached to him and i feel like i love him.

He hasn‚Äôt had a drink since that night on vacation. He definitely feels horrible about what happened. I‚Äôm close with his family and they‚Äôre all supportive of me as well and they even tried to convince me to report him to the police when it happened. 

he said he chooses me and his happiness over alcohol and he never wants to put us in that situation again. To my traumatized head, it seems sincere. But there‚Äôs always this feeling wondering if he can be abusive while sober too, because it‚Äôs how his brain is wired or if he‚Äôs chasing some kind of dopamine or seratonin spike. Being sober to an addict can be SO BORING (i am living proof) and they look for excitement.

But my whole question is, has anyone healed a relationship where alcohol, mixed with past trauma, was the main trigger for it? Do those drunk words really equate to sober thoughts? Is his one month of sobriety enough to think he might really change? He seems super sincere but honestly, my whole family completely hates him after everything he‚Äôs done and I just don‚Äôt want to waste anymore time. I unfortunately do absolutely love him, but that could be my own trauma.


I‚Äôve been in abusive relationships my whole life so I guess I‚Äôm just looking for clarity.

The last one that finally called me told me I was ineligible because there was no direct physical abuse. They asked 1 vague screening question and I answered it wrong and they said we can‚Äôt help you. I protested that I was referred to them because my relationship was too abusive for another center. That center has said I need your wraparound services because of my disability. This center said, no we help women who are at serious risk of being murdered soon‚Äîif that‚Äôs not you, we can‚Äôt help you. I was so devastated I couldn‚Äôt say anything. 


I‚Äôm disabled and largely bedbound/housebound. My partner is too smart and has too much to loose to hit me. But as a caregiver and financial provider, they instead put me in situations of incredible risk and negligence.  I‚Äôve had to be hospitalized with serious injuries because of it. More often it‚Äôs things like they‚Äôll set me up to run completely out of medications that are dangerous for me to stop. I would argue that this is physical abuse even if they aren‚Äôt touching me, considering my vulnerable status. Just like APS can get involved when elders are being abused without being hit. 

The normal every day stuff is my partner uses money to control me and deny me access to medical care. They bully, belittle, harass, shame, and insult me. They don‚Äôt stop when I say stop in sex. They tell me about violent sexual fantasies of hurting me. And on and on. This is a very powerful, well known, vindictive person, and I am afraid to do anything to confront them directly. I have to get out quietly, without accusing them of anything.

It was really upsetting to tell someone all the ways I am at risk and have them tell me it‚Äôs not enough for me to deserve help.

Because of my disability and medical problems, I don‚Äôt have hotline level challenges for getting out. I don‚Äôt think I could even medically stay in a shelter. I‚Äôm not sure what to do",2025-02-05 20:20:48,2025-03-17 03:04:32,violence
1co0ute,Scared to get an abortion after domestic violence,Comfortable_Wear7986,22,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1co0ute/scared_to_get_an_abortion_after_domestic_violence/,"My partner and I were together for three years he was a recovering addict and recently out of prison but we had been friends when we were younger and just fell in love very quickly and moved in together.

It‚Äôs been hard but we have built a beautiful life together that I just am finding it so difficult to let go of. He has been emotionally a sick for awhile getting really angry and loud that I don‚Äôt clean enough or that I am forgetful of certain things. Sometimes he drives really crazy in the car and it scares me and when he gets mad he will give me the silent treatment or go on hunger strikes for days until I‚Äôm so worried I just try to comfort him. Usually we makeup by having sex.

Over the last month it has started to escalate. On March 30 I didn‚Äôt squeeze the soap out of the sponge and he pushed me and shoved me and slapped me, I left immediately and drove around after a few hours I went home to see if he was calmed down and he wrecked my entire room. He said he would have to start smacking me to get me to listen if that was the only way. I was scared I tried to tell my best friend but I lost my nerve by the time we met up and he had started lovebombing me and being wonderful again.

Two weeks ago it got worse, I accidentally left ground Turkey out over night and he got really mad. He took my phone and locked me in my room with him in it blocking the door. I thought I could talk him down because I really needed to go to work but I couldn‚Äôt. I tried to scream and he choked me and threw me on the bed. I kicked him in the balls and tried to go for the door but he pushed me to the ground and strangled me I‚Äôm not sure if I passed out I can‚Äôt remember anymore what happened but eventually i was up and free and I tried to leave the house. He wouldn‚Äôt let me and instead took my phone and my laptop and my keys and said he was going to go overdose.

When he left I ran to my office where my iPad was an called my sister. My friend got me and brought me to her house and we called the police. They arrested him and he spent the weekend in jail.
He got out the following Monday the case was dropped because the police said my bruises and popped blood vessels weren‚Äôt bad enough and I don‚Äôt have enough evidence.

When he got out he went to our neighbors house and they took him in and tried to help him by putting him on a train to NorCal. I was doing good for a week until Monday I realized the date and took a pregnancy test.

We had always talked about having kids and had been trying and I couldn‚Äôt believe it, I‚Äôm 33 and am worried I won‚Äôt have another chance to be a mom but I don‚Äôt want to bring kids into this toxic environment or be tied to him forever.

I flipped out and I called him I was in Shock and I was so scared. He answered and I immediately regretted it as he tried to manipulate and get me to drop restraining order.

I‚Äôve told my best friend and she told me if I have this baby she won‚Äôt be in my life anymore and I really don‚Äôt want to lose her.

I just told my sister and my parents and they all want me to get an abortion too.

My ex 12 years ago was abusive; physically, mentally & sexually. I took our baby @ 9 months old and fled. 
Over the course of 12 years he's reached out & I've given him chances to see his daughter (when she was 4yo, 6yo, & 9y/o).
Him reaching out never amounts to much, he'll have the opportunity to see or talk to her on the phone. Then the next day goes back to getting high & going on stints to state prison. 

Shes now 12 years old. And as the pattern predicts, he's resurfaced. Only now he knows exactly where we live & has filed for custody. 

How do I navigate this? I'm tired of pretending it's water under the bridge & won't tolerate it now that I've matured and become a 32-year old adult & mother. I'm not the 18yo young girl he'd use as a punching bag with no support system & nowhere to go. 

I'm afraid for my daughter. His rage is explosive. He knows no limits and goes into blackouts. She also, doesn't know him and isn't interested. 

He has charges against him for assaulting me more than once. He's been in jail for it. He physically abused me every month for over 2 years. 


I need support because I'm too lenient. I'm so forgiving it's frustrating. But I have a daughter to protect from the abuse I endured. 

I always fall for his ""I'm sorry, I love you"" line. But I can't fall for it this time. I have no intention of going back after 12 years. But how do I get a backbone in this courtroom custody battle to keep my daughter away from him too?",2025-02-10 23:21:08,2025-03-17 03:05:35,violence

Maybe it‚Äôs envy‚Äîseeing mothers with baby showers, surrounded by family and security. I had none of that. I was under threat of violence just for telling my family I was pregnant.

My son was born early due to the overwhelming stress, and we spent nearly two weeks in the NICU. Thankfully, the hospital had a room for mothers with NICU babies, so I didn‚Äôt have to leave his side. But I was completely alone for most of it, until the final few days. I barely slept during that time‚ÄîI was constantly pumping, eating, doing skin-to-skin contact, and learning how to breastfeed. I had almost no one in my corner.

Postpartum wasn‚Äôt any better. The abuse continued, and my son was used as a pawn to control me. My now ex- boyfriend would dress him in his snowsuit and threaten to leave with him in below-freezing temperatures. My son would start screaming, and the sound would trigger my milk to flow, making my breasts ache unbearably. It was relentless‚Äîso much pain, so much trauma.

My shelter is closing on June 30 because LAHSA pulled their grant due to fraud. Instead of rehousing us, they‚Äôre just telling us to ‚Äúget income‚Äù to qualify for a PATH subsidy. Originally, we were told the subsidy would cover the deposit and part of the rent for the first year, tapering off gradually. Now, they‚Äôre only covering the deposit.

I was laid off while at the shelter and went on General Relief (GR) as advised by my case manager. But now she‚Äôs giving me the runaround, and since my GR is ending soon, I no longer qualify for housing assistance through it.

I‚Äôve been in the shelter for almost a year, and I‚Äôm beyond my breaking point‚Äîmentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I don‚Äôt feel safe here. I even had to issue a cease-and-desist to the main site coordinator for verbally assaulting and harassing me. I‚Äôve never been homeless before; I‚Äôm here because I‚Äôm fleeing domestic violence.

Recently, I got an offer for a fully remote state job‚Äîmy dream job. I‚Äôve been applying for months, and this is the only offer I‚Äôve received. But I have nowhere to set up an office, store paperwork, or hang professional clothes for video calls. The department hasn‚Äôt confirmed whether I need a hardline internet connection either. My car is literally my only space.

Now, my case manager suddenly tells me LAHSA has a housing program for people with mental health diagnoses. I got documentation from my therapist confirming PTSD and depression, plus verification of my physical disability. She says this should make me eligible, but she doesn‚Äôt know when LAHSA will get back to me. I‚Äôve been here for a year‚Äîwhy is she just now telling me about this when she‚Äôs known I‚Äôm fleeing domestic violence?

PATH is income-based, so I don‚Äôt qualify until I start working. I filed a grievance with LAHSA about the shelter closing with no rehousing plan, and they were shocked. They said it‚Äôs against their policy to exit people without a plan. The person I spoke to said she‚Äôd look into it, but I haven‚Äôt heard anything since. Apparently, the shelter was supposed to find a new grant, not shut down entirely.

When I tried to push for answers, the site coordinator basically mocked me and told me I should be ‚Äúlooking for housing.‚Äù How am I supposed to do that when they withhold info about internal programs? I also went to the Department of Mental Health for help, and they told me they don‚Äôt do housing‚Äîyet people from my shelter have gotten apartments through them, with rent covered and Section 8 vouchers, even though they weren‚Äôt fleeing DV or disabled.

For some context I'm 24M and partner 25M. We've been together for little under 5yrs. He found a text on my spam instagram to a straight guy I went to hs with that said ""hey"" nothing more nothing less. Was it the smartest idea no, I know fully understand that. However my partner had been texting and talking with another gay man at his work in secretly which I found out about on multiple occasions, it took time and a lot of heartache but I truly was able to forgive and move on and never mention it. But this man olds a grudge and never moves past things, he til this day brings up fights from the first month of dating. To make a long story short, I wanted to take a moment to share something important about my life. I know some may view me as a ‚Äúcheater‚Äù and feel I don‚Äôt deserve kindness, but I hope you can hear my story. I am a survivor of domestic abuse, and my partner has physically harmed me on two occasions.

After the first incident, he sought help and entered therapy, and I chose to stay with him because I began to see positive changes. However, the last incident occurred during a night of heavy drinking when he expressed a desire to join his late father. In a moment of desperation, I reached for the beer in his hand, and he violently slapped me to the ground, causing me to hit my head.

In fear for both of our lives, I called 911 but hung up as he grabbed his gun and began to make threatening remarks. I then contacted the veterans crisis line, knowing that having the police involved could lead to tragic outcomes. Unfortunately, they could not assist since he had already left the apartment.

I share this not for sympathy but to express the complexity of domestic situations. It‚Äôs crucial to understand that there are often two sides to every story. Thank you for taking the time to listen.

I still love this man but I don't know if anything is still worth saving in this relationship. I found out the same day he decided to ""break things off"" which was Valentine's Day night he added the guy he works with back on instagram and started texting him.",2025-02-25 17:20:45,2025-03-17 03:05:43,violence

I‚Äôve been doing this even though I know it doesn‚Äôt work because he will fallow me and to me it feels like he pokes at me till I end up responding in an aggressive manner(I have videos of this) On Saturday I wanted to go visit my mom but he was acting weird so I ended up not going so it wouldn‚Äôt cause a fight.

My husband and I have been separated for almost 6 months already (I‚Äôm living at home with my parents because I have physical disabilities). I‚Äôm 21, he‚Äôs 22 and we got married at 18 (terrible idea, I know), and we‚Äôve been together for about 5 and 1/2 years now. 
I left because he showed the signs of ‚Äúanger issues‚Äù that had led up to him hitting me the first time over two years ago (the second winter of our marriage). The thing about those times was, he never hit me hard. When he slapped me/hit me, it was lightly over the head in the context of ‚Äúwhy did you do/think that?‚Äù When I was struggling with thoughts of SH/other mental health issues. The other issues were that he didn‚Äôt make sure there was food in our home when I was bedbound for several months (post-covid syndrome is so awful), and that he refused to share his banking information or debit cards down to not even letting me know if the bills were paid. 
He‚Äôs been in therapy now for a few months and is on a medication for his mental health and seems to really be recognizing his issues (including bringing up specific things that he had done to hurt me, and ways he plans to resolve them), and he‚Äôs mentioned a few local couples therapists he would like to try together once he‚Äôs adjusted a bit more. He‚Äôs also going to take a class so that he can get into a better field so that he can support us better (it‚Äôs already paid for, he‚Äôs taking the class in April). 
I guess I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôve blown this out of proportion? Was this DV/abuse? Is it possible that he really is coming around and that things will be different or do I need to plan for a divorce? A lot of times I wonder if these mistakes that he‚Äôs made are due to the ways he was raised and being so young‚Ä¶his dad was AWFUL to his mom and I think recognizing that recently has definitely changed something in him. 
(I‚Äôm also taking steps to have my own income. Post covid is in my chart along with other issues so I should be able to get on SSI and then I‚Äôm hoping to finish my associates degree [COVID ruined that for me, too lol], and if I can get some improvement in my health I might be able to work from home in the future)",2025-02-18 01:35:40,2025-03-17 03:05:45,violence

**The cycle between the good and bad moments got shorter.** One day, he was being nice, and literally two days later, he grabbed my jaw and shoved me to the ground during another ridicolous argument.

I ended up locking myself in my room after that, and he wouldn‚Äôt leave for an hour, even though I kept texting him to go. He even took my phone at one point and dared me to call the police.

I am so scared.
I left on Saturday and I am safe.
Sunday I reported him. The police said they will inform him over the course of the week about the report.
Part of me is scared, what he will do.
90% of the stuff in the apartment is mine, yes, it's replaceable, but I have a feeling he will make my life as difficult as he can from now on.
To leave the apartment we both have to sign the termination. My landlord knows everything.
And part of me feels so guilty. We were together 5 years, and I don't recognise the sweet guy I met over 10 years ago.
Why do I feel guilty? Maybe because I still see the good in him, but was there ever any good in him? He manipulated and lied to me the whole relationship, I paid everything for him, he still owes me ~6000‚Ç¨. He has 0‚Ç¨ to his name because I found out the bank claims almost everything as soon as he gets paid. He is known to the police, all this time I had no idea and found out now.
I feel so empty, it's like a nightmare I can't wake up from...
I feel guilty, others went through much worse and I keep thinking, maybe this was fixable (maybe through couples therapy) but he always refused to go with me.

I (woman in 20s) live outside India, struggling with career, not completely settled.
Mother at home facing domestic violence. She won't call the police or choose divorce as an option. 
I can't keep flying back again and again, although I did a couple of times.
I have faced domestic violence myself when I was at home. Father has extreme anger issues and is a complete narcissist, it is not the case of drinking and hitting.This has always been the situation at home since my childhood.
I am getting stressed, and exhausted and always nervous about it happening again. Can't see mother in pain. 
Since I am a woman, she is of the belief of the society norms of not staying with daughters. 
How do I protect my mother? She has denied everything I can think of as a solution - no divorce, no police (as she can't deal with court cases etc and won't be able to spend so much money) , and wouldn't live with me. She probably mostly hides daily fights but tells me sometimes when she is extremely upset or got hit by my father very badly. It's been so many years of even thinking about it spiritually that maybe karma might take care of the situation itself. Relatives are tired of getting involved and explaining again and again. Neighbors are used to hearing the screaming sounds from the house every now and then. Feeling pretty helpless.

I personally and ideally would want to pull her out of that house permanently with a proper divorce. I can manage finances myself. I am ready to give in a couple of weeks by taking leaves from office. But she says I will destroy my career if I get into this. Exhauoall options. Pretty tired mentally.

Both parents are educated. Father has excessive male ego and calls himself head of the family and everything should happen according to him.

To be BEATEN FOR THE SMALLEST MISTAKES, like not doing what they asked immediately because you were still finishing another task? Or to be the OUTLET OF THEIR ANGER AT SOMEONE ELSE, as if your existence makes you the easiest target?  

These past few days, it happened again. I have BRUISES ON MY ARMS now because YOU HIT ME WITH A CHAIR. Why? Because I didn‚Äôt do your command right away, I was still finishing the first thing you asked. And then I GET SCOLDED BY MOM, told it was MY FAULT FOR NOT OBEYING QUICKLY. BOTH OF YOU ARE THE SAME.  

Do you remember? Back then, you‚Äôd BEAT US ALMOST EVERY DAY, MAKE US KNEEL ON SALT, LASH US WITH ANYTHING YOU COULD GRAB. You‚Äôd SCREAM THE MOST HURTFUL WORDS, BREAK EVERYTHING IN SIGHT, AND THROW THE PIECES AT US. You almost BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF MY YOUNGER BROTHER ONCE, all because you misheard them responding to you. And yet, somehow, WE‚ÄôRE THE PROBLEM?  

You ask why we cry. You ask why I FLINCH WHEN YOU RAISE YOUR VOICE, when your hand moves too quickly, when you pick up random objects. I forgave you once, back when I still believed YOU‚ÄôD CHANGE, when I convinced myself the ABUSE WAS OVER. I tried to forget the FEAR OF BEING IN THIS HOUSE, the TREMBLING EVERY TIME YOU WALKED BY, the PANIC WHENEVER YOU SPOKE. But now, YOU TWIST THE NARRATIVE, MANIPULATE THE SITUATION, and ask me why I feel this way?  

WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO GO? If I stay in my room, YOU‚ÄôRE ANGRY. If I sit in the living room, YOU COMPLAIN. If I leave the house, YOU ACCUSE ME OF BEING DISRESPECTFUL. WHERE DO I BELONG?  

Why do some parents CARRY THIS CULTURE OF VIOLENCE LIKE IT‚ÄôS A BADGE OF AUTHORITY? Why do they think they can CONTROL THEIR CHILDREN WITH FEAR AND PAIN, THEN DEMAND LOVE AND OBEDIENCE IN RETURN? At what point will they REALIZE THE DAMAGE THEY‚ÄôVE DONE, or is it easier to pretend it doesn‚Äôt exist?  ",2024-12-04 01:26:18,2025-03-17 03:06:08,violence

On 12/23 I was granted a temp no contact restraining order for myself, child and fianc√© of 3 1/2 years against my child‚Äôs father. Court hearing is in three weeks. Just a few days before got the restraining order granted, I had gone to pick up my child from his dad‚Äôs house on my child‚Äôs birthday. Little one had been sick the whole week prior and had to stay home. My partner works fully remote and I work hybrid. My son‚Äôs father was livid that I left little home home with my partner while I went to work one day. He began to say I‚Äôm neglecting him.. little one is very taken care of my myself and partner no matter if we are working from home. He still comes first! So when I went to pick up little his dad came charging to my car without my son, he screamed at me calling me a Cnt bitch and saying I need to take care of our son. He got in my face and eventually pushed me as I was walking towards him. The police questioned me walking towards him. It wasn‚Äôt fast or in an aggressive way, I can‚Äôt explain the reasoning but I did get a little closer after his dad had came but up to me and then he pushed me. I recorded the whole thing, I‚Äôm calm in the video.. 

I don‚Äôt have much tangible evidence besides this video and old photos of marks on my body. I‚Äôve tried to use the old photos during custody modifications but the lawyers always say ‚Äúwhy are you bringing this up now‚Äù 

.. I‚Äôve been hopeless until this video. Please if you‚Äôve been through this can you tell me what I can expect at the hearing in 3 weeks? 

Dad gets two visits a week right now that is monitored per court order. I want this to continue for at least a year and make him take classes for a year‚Ä¶ I want my kiddo to have his dad but even my little one is scared of his dad. 

Dad has also threatened my partners live a number of times. One time we did get it documented on a police report.. one time dad told me he should have killed him when he had the chance. 

It‚Äôs on going verbal insults, hardly ever over text only on the phone or in person. 

I didn‚Äôt file anything against him before because I was young and not well. He was and remains abusive.. ",2024-12-26 05:01:10,2025-03-17 03:06:11,violence

1g1tw3l,Is this domestic violence/abuse?,angieisdead69,7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1g1tw3l/is_this_domestic_violenceabuse/,"Hi, me (16F) in june,got out of a relationship that lasted a year with my ex (19M). 
I need some perspective. Was this normal behavior and I was exaggerating or was I abused?
So, first of all I‚Äôm sorry if my english isn‚Äôt perfect, I‚Äôm not a native speaker, but I will try my best. 
As I was saying, in may of 2023 i got with my ex-boyfriend, who was 18 at the time and i was 14. It all started when we met with friends in common and we started to date pretty quickly, after a week of knowing each other. I don‚Äôt know if I was love bombed or if we just rushed things too much, but in a month or so i met his family, and i was spending nights at his house, he would buy me gifts, we would spend all out time together and he would shower me with attention and love.
After some time, 2 months or so, he started showing some signs of instability, but i shrugged it off because i thought he was just insecure or some stupid shit like that.
But it got worse, we would argue for days and days, and he started to humiliate me and insult me for hours doing these arguments. Then he started showing some signs of physical violence.
In the year that we‚Äôve been together, he has done some pretty nasty things. But i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm exaggerating.
He would slap me hard on my back and on my thighs, push me, drag me across the room or throw things at me.
He destroyed my phone, and torn two nails from my fingers ( I don‚Äôt think it was on purpose, but he didn‚Äôt apologize)
He also crossed many boundaries and would repeatedly ask me for sex even if i wasn‚Äôt in the mood, and if we didn‚Äôt do it he would get mad and grumpy.
Then after we broke up he kept contacting me, and when i told him that i was seeing another guy, he went crazy, threatening me and saying that he hopes that he uses me and treats me like shit.
So, what do you think? Is this normal behavior? Because i‚Äôve been experiencing some panic attacks when someone hits me or yells at me. Every opinion is appreciated! Thank you :)",2024-10-12 06:12:06,2025-03-17 03:06:16,violence

I honestly wasn't expecting that nor wanted him to get charged, I simply wanted an order to allow me to get my property and leave, he has had a prior order on him from an ex whom he grabbed by the throat while angry but that order wqs removed by his ex. 

Honestly he is a good guy and this incident was an isolated event with me, he has never otherwise physically hurt me or assaulted me before, i don't want to see him go to jail and i'm scheduled in the morning to go in at 9am back at the police station they said. I made it clear to the officer that i simply wanted to get my belongings and wasn't looking to get a restraining order or press charges on him.

Is there anything i can do to remove the charges?  Even though he grabbed me like that and did get physical i feel this has gone way beyond what it needed and a simple order to allow me to take my things and move out. He isn't an otherwise bad person or someone who would abuse me, I think he just git very upset and was trying to hold me back in his frustration.

Even in the prior incident with his ex his ex cancelled his restraining order as he was the one who made the situation worse and agravated him.

What should i do? I don't want to see him go to jail and regardless of the relationship ending it hurts to see him possibly face jail and have to go through such a process when he is otherwise a good person.",2023-12-15 07:51:35,2025-03-17 03:06:17,violence

I saw a lot of violence towards my mother as a child. When I was a child, I simply masked all my emotions relating to violence through getting in trouble with authority and becoming obsessively involved with my schoolwork. I don't have trouble talking to women but forming deep relationships with women is very difficult. As a result, I turned to many systems that I thought would help me overcome this. I tried going to therapy on two different occasions but quit after experiencing no growth for months on end. I tried martial arts twice for about 6 months each as I thought it would help me foster a different connection to the violence. It ended up making me more pissed as it always seemed like I never found anyone who can connect with violence the way I do. I tried going to Acupuncture therapy twice as well, to no avail. I tried doing tons of psychedelic drugs to see if that would help. Living my life on drugs was the closest thing I experienced to a life where violence doesn't affect me as negatively as it has. I'm very scared that as violence is such a major part of the real and legal world, that either I'm going to commit a act of violence that I can't overcome or that I may blow my brains out to see if I can deal with violence better in a different spiritual realm.

base facts for understanding
-we were together for over 7 years
-about 2 and a half months ago he snapped because I scuffed his shoe and he stewed on it for 30 seconds before stomping on my ankle. this was the first act of physical violence against me, though there has been other instances where I've been scared.
-I was alienated from my friends and family because he begged me not to tell them
-it took 3 weeks to get him to let me go to a doctor, I was supposed to lie, I did not lie, doctor got me on touch with a social worker and helped me with a safety plan
-I have a cat from before we were together, our first dog he bought but legally is mine, the 2nd dog I bought and is legally mine.
-we have no children
-I am financially stable on my own and we have a cohabitation agreement so I can't lose the house.
-the first year and a half we lived together he was the breadwinner while I was in university. the bills for 60him/40me, once I finished school we were 50/50 for a year and a half. after I bought the house bills became 90 me 10 him and I was lucky if he paid me back for food in a month, this has been like this for 3 years. 
-in the years I was in university his mom told anyone who would listen that I was a gold digger. She never apologized.
-he started counselling for his anger issues about a month ago
-I asked him to leave about 2 weeks ago, he begged me to stay and just call it a break, I said I'd love to forgive him but its going to take time and I don't know if I can get past the fear of him doing it again. and domestic violence is as bad as cheating in my opinion. we went to a couples counselling session together and have another one scheduled.
-he's been staying with his parents since.
-he took the dog that he bought but drops her off most days because I work from home and can take care of her.
-since I asked him to leave he has started an anger management course and is trying to do a domestic violence handbook written for abusers to try to not be abusive
-I do beleive he is genuinely sorry. and if I had to bet I would bet he wouldn't do it again. but even if the ""he does it again"" chance is 10%.... I dont want to risk that.

Okay so base facts down here's the rant. I love him. I really do. but I'm just dying inside. these past 2 weeks alone even though they've been hard it's actually been easier to be alone. the worst part is the dog. everyone keeps saying that he's just taking the dog to keep a connection with me. I love that dog. I've done everything for that dog every vet appointment every bag of food every dog license, microchip, spaying, when she had her first heat, 3 levels of dog school and we got good enough we had a dance routine. and he says ""I think you miss the dog more than me"" I DO!!! THE DOG DIDNT STOMP ON MY ANKLE YOU DID! ""I know seeing me every day is hard but I just want the dog to have a sense of normalcy"" IF YOU CARED ABOUT THE DOGS SENSE OF NORMACY YOU'D JUST LEAVE HER HERE! my coworkers all said  ""do you care that she's taken care of or that she's with you?"" and I do care more than she's taken care of.... I just wish it was by me.

Then I've been BEGGING for space. I need space to heal and every day ""is this enough space? how do you feel about us? do you feel like we made progress yesterday? how do you think you're going to learn to feel safe with me again if I'm never around you?"" I FEEL SMOTHERED!!!! SOOOOOOO SMOTHERED!!!!! 

Then I have the dog he took back this weekend (he's out of town for work) I'm enjoying my day with my puppies. and his mom texts me ""hey how are you"" and im like ""oh she's just trying to be nice"" so I answer ""im doing okay in the grand scheme of things, better than *name* unfortunately"" because like it is unfortunate I don't want him to be sad I'm just trying to prioritize myself and my healing because NOBODY ELSE WILL and she goes off like ""you have to start putting trust back in if you want this to work""

I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU THAT YOU GET TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE YOU DONT HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PERSON WHOS SUPPOSED TO LOVE YOU AND WONDER WHAT LITTLE THING YOU DO IS GOING TO SET THEM OFF! I do not live in that world. I get to live in the world where the stat ""1/4 women will experience domestic violence"" I never get to be a part of that 3/4 again. I am now the 1/4. but thank you MIL for reminding me that once again I am alone.

She shows all the traits of an abusive controlling jealous and angry partner including not letting me work or have relationships with people.

Everything I do is met with punishment. 

No one understands. And it making me sour to people. 

Police blatantly ignore this. And so does the NDVH or the Hotline. I sent help texts out a month and a half ago and they sent an APS lady to be nice to my face and then angry and abusive over messages.

They have no regard to what she‚Äôll do to me. I can‚Äôt take it anymore. 

This is the only way I can contact people and they blocked it.

Growing up I witnessed a lot of domestic violence between my father and mother, as well as between him and my brother, and it being aimed at me. I always tried to rationalise it but it hit a peak recently where my mum is in the process of divorcing him, thank god.
I feel like I‚Äôve suddenly become aware of how much I‚Äôve witnessed and experience growing up- physically, emotionally. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly going to have a panic attack. 
I‚Äôm in therapy but is there any other support for adults who witnessed/experienced domestic violence as a child? I‚Äôm UK based and would appreciate any info. ",2024-11-13 12:51:24,2025-03-17 03:06:31,violence

It sucks cause I‚Äôve been trying everything I can to get away. I stayed because it was cheaper than doing this. I‚Äôm not going back.

1edfjis,Unbelievable violence at next door,Hot-Data3404,5,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1edfjis/unbelievable_violence_at_next_door/,"I live in North York for many years, and never felt unsafe before yesterday. I came to Canada because everyone I ever met they made me feel so nice. That's why I never doubt any sec to stay in such a lovely country. Then, until yesterday, I started thinking because of a condo neighbours domestic violence matter.

My neighbour next door is a couple, and I truly don't know if they are married or not, but they sometimes invite fellas to come over. I also realized they have a cute dog when they first moved in cuz it barks a lot. That's everything I know about them.

Yesterday I woke up at noon and took a quick shower to fresh up, then I heard on the other side of wall there's a man verbally abused a woman and woman was crying so loud and terrified. Until I finished my shower, the noise didn't stop and the fight last for almost 20 mins. I can't believe such a terrible noise can last that long and no one step out to take care of it, so I call the security to come up and check out the noise and make sure no one is in danger because I heard something smashed. The first time I called security and there's no one came up, and I waited for 30 mins and still no one showed up. Fortunately, my neighbour finally went quiet. Then I called security again to tell them the noise went down but I wish there's no one got hurt, I wanted to know if anyone was sent to check on them and is everything fine......Security lied to me, she said she sent someone, and the truth is she didn't. I did not see anyone. I asked her if she called police instead of sending someone and she said she can't call police without check, and she told she did not report to the manager yet, then she said to me in a rude manner, ""next time you should call the police on your behalf"". I was so pissed. As a woman, I feel sorry for that woman next door; and as a tenant, I feel shocked what security said and she did. She also a woman!!!!! OFC I will call the police by myself next time since I know what kind of security my building hired!!!!!

Since yesterday I didn't see that woman came out from that room, and I don't know how she's going to overcome these and protect herself. I think the neighbour next door they probably are immigrants cuz they don't speak in English privately, and that woman may not know in Canada there's law can protect her safety. Or......what I can ever imagine in the worst situation......if the immigration is the reason she cannot leave that guy???

To be honest, back to the fact, I don't hate any races or anyone. The truth is I can tolerant diversities in my circle cuz diversities do bring out more fun in life. However, I wish I immigrate to a place that people enjoy peace and compassion, also the quality of immigrants do relevant to the average national quality.",2024-07-27 12:44:30,2025-03-17 03:06:38,violence

Hes 34 im 28 we have been together for a year and few months we live with his family. Our situation has gradually gotten worse first hed burp in my face, hed make me pay more than half of our activities together, i remember our very first Christmas together which was last year i made him excited for his present then we had a conversationa about how he would take me shopping if i got him a really expensive collectible item for $400, time came and he said oh i didnt say that and plus i dont have a lot of money rn. i said its okay don't worry i then said what will you get me he then said idk what do you want? remember baby i dont have a lot of money rn either.¬† Through the beginning hed call me little names like the r word, stupid, idiot and what not, hed tell me to stop asking so many questions, after a while of no questions i just started to speak my mind thinking this would settle his mind because it wasnt asking questions but now he tells me he cant focus on his phone while hes scrolling through youtube while i talk to him or out loud to the. When i do mind my business he looks at me and says why cant you be in the middle or why are you so quiet. If i tell him my plans he will say no planning i dont wanna know dont tell me i dont care. When i walk about my feelings he says i dont care. He will give me a disappointed look like can you stop talking. A few months ago we were arguing coming out of a drive thru he was upset because i like too many sauces and because i was asking him about what we were gonna do the next day. We then went home and he ran out back because he said he needed to get away from me for a decond.¬† Then i told him im sorry i feel like if i say anything i upset you its like i cant be myself around you. He got upset and punched a tree in the back. His hand was then broken for a month he was off of work. He blames me and says its all your fault. If you didnt do this this wouldn't have happened its your fault he says when he looks at me i want to cry. A few days ago he was hiding his phone so i got paranoid and went through his instagram at 4 am and saw that he was still on tinder a week after our relationship had formed messaging a girl saying hey its me from tinder and i woke him up and asked him whats this? he flipped out and started beating a house object and i grabbed him to make him stop hurting himself and unfortunately his arm got strained. Now he blames me for his arm being hurt too. After that happened he woke up his whole house and they were like whats going on. He told them. Then he walked out front and i followed. He started saying¬† i dont even know how that got there i wasnt talking or on tinder after we got together and i didnt even message her back either after that one i stopped. I said okay okay. He said i cant be with you if we cant trust each other he said we need to work on this. Then i was saying okay okay and he yelled and said more things like you evil effing b word, he said you stupid and a few more things after that. Then i got scared and said okay im gonna leave i cant do this being as loud as him and then he told me to calm down get inside stop being loud as hes yelling at me on his front porch then he like pushes me front and knocks me down by tripping me from the back i fell pretty hard and he gets in my face and shouts at me more. I kept trying to hug him while i was crying saying im sorry im sorry but he kept pushing me off a few times hed shove me. I was just so emotional. We then sat on a wall and i was about to fall down being distraught and he said common lets go down and as he was putting his foot off he he kicked me in the tummy a little. He said sorry sorry but i felt the anger the anger in his foot. That day i had back pain at work. I told my work and i couldn't work the whole day. I left early. He also spat on me while he was upset during this stuff forgot to say. He makes jokes about killing me. Today he made a coffin joke saying its because. he gets mad if i ask him abything or anything. He hates me sometimes i feel. I feel hes only with me because im all he can get. He doesnt like to touch me or kiss me or make out too much he says stop kissing me so much when I just give him face loves. He isnt cheating. He doenst let me leave really much anymore too. If i go he says youre leaving me. He gets mad and says if you do that ill go without you. Hes the lonesome wolf type and he used to get bullied for stuff like weight and stuff in the past how can i help him love him? How can i make him see me? How can i keep his love? Im his first love. I want him to be my last love. I dont want to fail him.

December 22, 2023 I got arrested for a class A misdemeanor assault causing bodily injury for punching my spouse on the side of her stomach. I pleaded for deferred adjudication and was given 9 months probation, with community hours and a bipp program. 

Fast forward to August 20th, 2024. I got arrested for the same charge in a different county with my spouse again. Weeks later she emailed the victims advocate saying she falsified the police report for her own personal gain given we‚Äôre going through a divorce and a divorce isn‚Äôt something that she wanted. She simply didn‚Äôt want to accept that I wanted a separation. The victims advocate forwarded that email to the prosecutors office and my court hearing for this 2nd charge got delayed because they‚Äôre trying to find any additional evidence against me. 

Is there anybody that has gone through a situation similar? Anybody with experience or knowledge with criminal cases like this? 

An MTR was issued and I‚Äôm turning myself in on Friday, 2 days from now. I have bond, but after that will be my hearing for probation revocation. I did hire an attorney for this.

1fbaqn8,Witnessed domestic violence at age of 3.,GoodNico09,4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1fbaqn8/witnessed_domestic_violence_at_age_of_3/,"So Back in 2012 (yes im still pretty young) my dad was abusive toward my mother. I don‚Äôt remember anything except when I witnessed what my dad did to my mom.

I saw him beating up my mom, I was watching quietly, I did nothing, not even a scream of terror or cry. I just watched immobile terrified what I was witnessing. I was supposed to be outside playing with my 2 older sisters, not witnessing something that would change my life. And I still have very precise memory from this specific moment.

At the time I was the youngest of the family (3y old), one of my sister was 7 years old at the time and the other sister was 10 years old. I think in the familly I was the only one to have witnessed the domestic violence.

My dad was not abusive toward us, but he was neglecting us. One time (I don‚Äôt remember it) he locked up me and my 2 sisters in the car, for no reason.

And yes there were dramatic consequences to what I witnessed. After that my mom saw that I was starting to have trouble speaking, and that my motor skills were worse than before. I got diagnosed with dyspraxia and dysphasia (or aphasia, idk what its called).

My parents divorced the same year (2012). And my dad went back to live in portugal like 2 years after (I live in central europe.) and since then I very rarely see him. and the year after the incident I got nightmares frequently. I had PTSD when I was like 4!

At the end the only thing that help me cope with these memories are my plushies. I do not age regress, I am very very attached to my plushies. Its my only way I can feel better and feel understood.

I never would have known how bad it was had survivors like me not blatantly said alarming words like ‚ÄúRUN‚Äù and ‚Äúget out before he kills you‚Äù. 

I felt trapped knowing I was sleeping next to someone who could murder me while not knowing what step to take next. Even after my eyes were opened to his sick ways I still questioned whether I was exaggerating‚Ä¶.

Abuse isn‚Äôt constant. There are good times that make the horrible dark times seem light. How can someone make me feel so good, loved and safe‚Ä¶then turn around and make me feel worthless, insecure, and alone? The cycle becomes addicting. I tolerate the lows because I know they are followed by highs (love bombing). 

But at the end of the day, I felt helpless. Dependent on someone who provided relief for the pain they caused. I felt misunderstood. Alone. Crazy. Sad. Abandoned. 

Physical scars heal but emotional scars stay. My ex built me into who he needed me to be and then broke me down every time I started to gain independence. It took $22,000 in facial damages for me to ‚Äòopen my eyes‚Äô and leave.

You can‚Äôt lose yourself if you don‚Äôt know who you truly are. That‚Äôs exactly who abusers seek out - the wounded, self-sabotaging, worth-seeking, lonely individuals who they can mold into their next victim. 

I found myself through prayer, and being reminded that I AM loved by the unchanging, unwavering God the Father. He doesn‚Äôt love me any less or any more today than he did the day he pulled me away from my ex. He has brought me SO far ü§ç and no matter what avenue you take, you can make it out too!

I am 100% certain he would have killed me if I didn‚Äôt leave. I am so fortunate to be here today telling my story. I pray this finds the right people and you make it out so you can tell your testimony too.

I dated my partner for nearly four years until we broke up in March because he started dating other people. He says he's in love with me, but he knows that I'm not in love with him. Unfortunately, we are still living together. He has been violent with me in the past, always during arguments, but he's never left bruises or anything. In the past, he would sulk when I refused sex and demand a long talk/make me explain myself over and over/sometimes lose his temper. But this past year, his personality has changed. He has a history of serious assault on an ex partner. Here are some of the things he has started doing to me:

* Picking fights, then accusing me of being abusive/hateful/toxic/etc when I react
* Grabbing things (mostly my phone) out of my hands, then criticizing me for ignoring him
* Once in May, he tried to hack into my email/computer/socials when I left the house
* Twice recently he's insisted on bringing me lunch at my job (this feels controlling but I can't explain why -- I know it seems like a nice gesture)
* Suddenly criticizing me and calling me a narcissist/explaining all of my faults out of nowhere
* Criticizing/raising his voice at me for absurd things like saying ""sure"" to a request instead of ""yes,"" then getting more angry when I defend myself  
* Jokingly pushing me down when I stand up from the couch (he's done this three times, I got mad and asked him to stop and he laughed at me and called me a baby) 
* Pouting or starting an argument/excruciatingly long ""talk"" 
* Physically blocking me from leaving a room after he starts an argument

I am very isolated, but I'm extra confused because he doesn't tell me where I can/can't go or what I can/can't wear, take my money, prevent me from seeing people, or other hallmarks of abusive relationships. One thing he has always done, though, is offer to accompany me just about anywhere. This has made me feel much less independent even though he isn't forceful about it. 

In March, he got mad that I wouldn't speak to him (I wasn't trying to stonewall, I just knew that anything I said would only make him angrier) so he pushed me down into a chair a number of times, blocked me from leaving, then when I got outside, he chased me around, grabbing me by my clothes and shoulders and arms and restraining me from leaving. At one point he grabbed my face and screamed at me to look at him. I scratched his arm to try to get him to let go, and he told me that I had abused him.

A few days ago, he chased me up the stairs into my room. I tried to lock the door behind me, but he was on the other side, so I couldn't lock it. I was holding it shut with all of my weight when he rammed his body against the door and I crashed into the wall, then stumbled into my mirror. It left a bruise and a rugburn on my elbow. Then he straddled me on the bed and screamed in my face, told me all of this was my fault, and started licking his fingers and trying to rub them all over my face. Then he told me not to bother locking my door because he could get in whatever he wants, and locking my door would only make him more angry. 

The next day, I expected an apology, but he told me that I'm lucky to have a face. He said that he ""loves himself"" and he's ""incredible"" for ""showing restraint."" He said that if I were a man, he would have beaten the shit out of me. He said I'm lucky that he was willing to spend time with me.

He's out of town for the weekend. I told my family and best friend (both live far away) and they are very concerned for me. They're telling me that I can't share a space with him any longer and I need to stay in a shelter or something, but I have a full time job and a dog. Obviously I don't want to live with him any longer, but our lease is up in October. Can I wait until then?? Is this domestic abuse, even without the classic controlling signs? I feel sick to my stomach when I think back on the past several years. I'm so overwhelmed and my family is making me even more afraid. 

I don't have any friends in my city that I could stay with. Just acquaintances that I'm not comfortable asking. ",2024-07-27 22:33:33,2025-03-17 03:07:51,violence

I live with my gf in a town away from my family and I‚Äôve been physically and emotionally abused by her for a little over two years. 

For a while I didn‚Äôt take the abuse personally, maybe because I‚Äôm a man and somewhere deep down feel I should be able to take some punches. But it‚Äôs been going on for over a year now and I have to make a move. My gf has so many mental health issues and essentially relies on me to take care of her. She also is an alcoholic which fuels her psychotic episodes. Our lease is up in July but we haven‚Äôt talked about breaking up or anything even though she suspects I‚Äôm going to do it (which fuels her abusive episodes). 

Another aspect is that she has almost no support system, misunderstanding mother as well as an alcoholic narcissist father. They both feel overwhelmed with dealing with her so it‚Äôs up to me to get her medication or take her to appointments. Her brother is great but just had a baby with his wife. I guess she‚Äôll be moving in with them when the lease is up but I have so much anxiety. 

My gf is also suicidal and threatens suicide often. She has said before very frankly that if I left her she‚Äôd ‚Äúprobably kill‚Äù herself. I want to believe that things can be ok after I‚Äôm gone but every part of my being is anxious to. 

Any words of advice are much appreciated, also I‚Äôm in the Missouri US if anyone has any resources.

Just curious if anyone else feels like you have to take hours out of your day to deal with continuous violations to a DVO which was awarded for 3 years, the maximum in my state. I feel like I‚Äôm doing all the work while he‚Äôs sitting back and violating the DVO almost everyday with any consequences. 

I‚Äôve been trying to file contempt against him for the DVO. He‚Äôs hacked all my phone, accessed and changed things, was able to access EVERYTHING in my phone. Pics, texts, phone conversations, all email correspondence, files‚Ä¶you name it‚Ä¶he has accessed it. A lot of what he accessed is personal and puts me in more danger of harm by him. He knows my alarm code, everything I‚Äôm doing to file charges against him, etc. 

He has got into my USPS app where I receive informed deliveries and has rerouted many packages and has stolen packages out of my locked mail box inside my building. (I live in a condo so it‚Äôs cluster mailboxes) In the DVO it‚Äôs stated clearly that he cannot be 500 feet from me. Including my residence if I‚Äôm home or not. 

He is a servre alcoholic and is dillusioniinal. Thinks people are watching. Says he‚Äôs god and that the CIA watches him, etc.   He takes make antipsychotic medications. He is a harm ti anyone he comes in contact with.

He has told me that he‚Äôs ready to die. I have no doubt he would kill me then kill himself.

I live in a constant state of fear.  

I‚Äôm exhausted and am trying to fight for my life but it‚Äôs sure not easy. I‚Äôve unfortunately seen the lack of resources and help there really is for DV victims. 

It‚Äôs affecting every part of my life. I thought he would just go away after the DVO instead it unleashed an eviler monster whom is out to get me and I don‚Äôt know why. ",2024-08-16 17:38:27,2025-03-17 03:08:01,violence

My partner isn't consistently physically abusive (only a couple times but he wasn't sober) but is regularly emotionally and verbally abusive according to my therapist. The problem is that he doesn't see it as abuse which makes me not see it as abuse either but my therapist is insistent. He just sees it as ""expressing his feelings"" or something similar. I have been in very physically abusive situations in the past (different partners) so it took awhile for me to understand the emotional part of it but I can honestly say this hurts worse than the physical part. 

Anyways, he doesn't listen to me or my therapist because he thinks I'm lying to her so she's biased. So I'm thinking that some kind of group like AA but for relationships where there multiple people who can give input might make him belive he needs to change.

I have a friend who had moved into a low budget neighborhood and has only been trouble since.

She met a man in the same apartment complex and started hanging out and became romantic until she started seeing red flags after a couple months. The previous residents of her apartment were part of Domestic violence as well and the lock would not lock on her door. At some point, he had taken her keys and made a copy without her knowledge. So for about a month+ he comes in and stays without her consent and has gotten more violent as time passes. As far as Im aware, there is rape, death threats of family and anyone who is willing to get in the way, sexual assault, blades to her throat, and keeps her up at consistently as night so she is sleep deprived and has weapons with him all the time.

Ive offered help and got her lock fixed through a handyman because the landlords wont fix it for her. but even then he still has a copy of the key. She's got a long list of abuse done to her and has a recording of him talking about the death threats, his obsession and agreeing to some physical violence.

She's finally reached out to the cops after Ive suggested getting a Protective Order but she's worried that hes the kind of man to kill her and himself if an order is put in place. And even if he is convicted of his felonies, She's worried about Him being able to pay Bail and then its back to the normal stuff.

She can only afford this housing and has a kid shes trying to put into a decent school so moving is off the table.

What Are the consequences of violating a Protective order? She says he'll only be held for 24hrs but that doesn't seem right.
Is she right to be scared and not go through with the Protective Order?
what other options are there? 
Security systems? Resources?
I can only help so much but its all up to her

Her in-laws are harassing her and torturing her for money. Finding fault in everything she does.

We found the match via matrimonial website. Her husband didn't mention his smoking and drinking habits. Even though he is earning decent money, he is always short of funds. He hurls abuse at my sister and asks her to leave his home. He once even pushed her out of his home late at night. He drinks and smokes almost every day. He has increased cholesterol because of that. He is very manipulative and lies all the time. He makes things up like being threatened to be beaten by us. (we have recordings of his lies)

We paid for all events from Roka to the Wedding. Even partially paid for her honeymoon. We gave her a decent amount of gold and gifts. We have the recordings (they asking for chain and FDs) and receipts of jewellery and transfers made to them for paying Banquets and all.



My questions are :

1. Are call recording and other recording acceptable in court?

2. My sister's jewellery is in a locker of his in-laws at their native place. How can we make sure that we get it back and the amount we transferred to his account?

3. while my sister is there, if anything alarming happens like a fight or if his husband hits her what should she do? ( though he has hit her with his elbow while on their honeymoon. She was too terrified to report)

4. Should she leave her home on her own, or should we go there to bring her back? ( keeping in mind we want to get back the jewellery given during the wedding)

5. Can this marriage be annulled?( as he lied about his height, habits and he has some sexual issue though I am not sure as he consulted with a specialist about it)

6. As my sister not working, will she be entitled to alimony or maintenance?

7. What cases can be filed against such a fraudster and cheap person and his sister who fuels and controls her brother's demeanor?

8. How can we protect ourselves from him filing a false case against us?

9. Are there any good NGOs that can assist and help in Bangalore and Ajmer?

He uses rage and aggression to force me to have sex with him, and promised me that he will become violent if I don't capitulate to sex with him. I find him physically repulsive to all of my senses,, and I need to dissociate when he rapes me, to stop me from killing him in the act.

He is a very dangerous individual. People steer away from him and he loses friends left and right, everyone citing his terrifying and erratic behavior as the reason. He has an ex-girlfriend that one day just took all her belongings and left him while he was at work, and never spoke to or saw him again. I know now why she had to do this.

He regularly drives drunk and tries to instruct people on shooting while drunk. He is also an erratic driver prone to road rage even when sober, and he is ready to shoot at drivers as he has his hand on his gun whenever someone cuts him off in traffic.

He is an enormous pervert and misogynist that regularly tries to pressure me into sexual acts I despise, I have also watched him sexually harass a woman right in front of me. He has a vile, sickening view of women and sex.

He has lost control physically before and wrestled me into strange sexual positions against my will and pushed my legs behind my head and stretched my mouth open with his fingers while calling me a whore and slut. This was a violent act when he lost control of his rage. He then slapped me across the face and spat in my face. He regularly spits on my face.

I am desperate to get away from him but I have major problems

1) I am disabled and mildly depend on him
2) I have been laid off from my job and am running out of money fast. I have been applying to jobs nonstop and no one wants to hire me, even though I have a college degree and lots of experience.
3) We have pets together that I adore and do not want to leave, he is an irresponsible and careless pet owner.
4) I am almost never home alone & he has cameras outside of the house, so he'd know if I leave.
5) He is suspecting me HIGHLY of leaving, he told me this recently so he's on to me.
6) He is highly suspicious of the main person who is aware of his abuse of me, this same person is also helping me create a plan to leave him.

Please I am begging for help. I am his prisoner. I am being raped regularly. I feel he may kill me. I have many video recordings of his rage and also screenshots of him admitting that he demands sex ""or else."" 

I have never been this miserable and depressed in my whole life. I am dead inside. I have several times considered ending it all just to escape this.

Forgot to add that he is talking about having a baby ASAP. He refuses to use condoms and regularly ""finishes"" way too close to my vagina carelessly. I think he is trying to impregnate me.",2025-02-25 09:20:42,2025-03-17 03:08:20,help

Reddit, I (42f) need your help.  

My daughter (20f) is in an extremely abusive relationship with her boyfriend (20m) of the last two years. 

In recent weeks, she came to me saying that he had choked her unconscious, then pulled a knife on her after she woke up from being choked.  He later admitted to her that after she had been choked unconscious, he returned to her passed out body and choked her some more!!?!  This is not the first time something like this has happened and I fear / know she‚Äôll end up dead if ties aren‚Äôt severed completely. 

She moved back in with me that day, but refuses to officially end things with him.  I have come to decide that her judgement is compromised, to say the least, and I‚Äôm struggling to know how I can exert influence to save her life without pushing her away and back into his POS arms.  

I discovered last week that she is literally spending hundreds of minutes on the phone with him every day, using AirPods and allowing this asshole to listen in on everything that happens around her, including private conversations between me and my other daughters.  This feels like an insane breach of our privacy, security, etc.

I also stumbled upon her allowing him to deliver her food to my house today!  He pulled up as her ‚Äúdoor dash‚Äù, something only discovered because I entered her room at the right moment for her to not be able to hide it.

I can tell her she can‚Äôt see him, but I fear she‚Äôll just leave.  

REDDIT WHAT DO I DO?!  THIS GUY IS GOING TO KILL MY CHILD AND I AM FORCED TO JUST SIT BACK AND WATCH. 

Please help me figure out a plan to handle this, point me towards resources / those able to help, or just share your insights / wisdom so that I‚Äôve got a fighting chance.  

Thanks in advance.  

Tl;dr - Adult-ish daughter refuses to stop seeing a violent psychopath she‚Äôs dating and I‚Äôm out of ideas about how to save her.",2025-01-14 02:29:24,2025-03-17 03:08:21,help

I did all the right thing, I contacted women‚Äôs aid in my county and surrounding counties. I got legal advice. I even tried speaking to 101 for advice. 

What I learned was that they would not be able to make him leave our home. The home that was bought with a deposit from my inheritance. The house that I work full-time in a demanding job to afford. 

Women‚Äôs aid could not offer me somewhere to stay. I can‚Äôt stay in a hostel, I‚Äôm autistic and I spent enough time in them as a kid to know I couldn‚Äôt do it. If I wanted a house, I‚Äôd need to pay over 1k a month, while also still paying the mortgage on the house to stop it being repossessed. 

The legal advice line I spoke to gave me bad advice. The lawyer I engaged charged me 5k and left me with literally nothing to show. I was physically sick when I got their bill. But they were lawyers and I couldn‚Äôt contest it. 

The police were the worst. I called 101 for advice after I was told to do so. They started harassing me, telling me they were going to come to our house and speak to my husband about what I‚Äôd said. They came to the house in the middle of the night once and luckily he didn‚Äôt notice. I started having panic attacks because I was so terrified that they were going to get me hurt. They completely took away my agency. They also told me that without any evidence from friends or neighbours, it was unlikely he would get any punishment. 

Of the small number of friends and family I have, those who wanted to help couldn‚Äôt do anything to actually help. Those who could didn‚Äôt want to. And I stopped telling anyone about the abuse because all I got was judgement for not leaving. 

Since it started, I developed a serious illness and am now limited physically in what I can do. I think the stress of trying to leave again will kill me if he doesn‚Äôt. ",2024-11-14 15:29:33,2025-03-17 03:08:23,help

One of the women who works there frequently has injuries that have included black eyes, a broken wrist, burst blood vessels in her eyes, and various bruises. It seems like every time I go in there, she's hurt, and I don't pry beyond expressing casual concern. She always has a story that seems plausible - fell down the stairs, got in a car accident, etc.

When we were at the store two weeks ago, she couldn't speak above a raspy whisper and claimed it was laryngitis. I have heard before that strangulation is a huge escalation in domestic violence and I fear for this woman's safety. But I also don't want to make accusations or assumptions when I really have no knowledge. Is there anything I can do to help her?

Don't know if this matters, but she is an immigrant and likely in her early 60s. I don't know anything more than that, but I recognize there could be factors I have absolutely no idea about that could make all of this even trickier.

Thank you.

Added for clarification: She speaks very good English and we communicate quite well. I just don't know what the cultural or legal issues could be surrounding this and I don't want to potentially cause her more trouble by blundering in without understanding.

Over these two years, she‚Äôs become one of my closest friends, and at this point we‚Äôve both admitted that it‚Äôs become more than that really. For context, I work a part-time job and she is also one of my coworkers. One day she showed up to work with CLEAR signs of a physical altercation happening between her and her bf (bruising under the eye), and since that day I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about it. This was about 8 months ago. Around the same time, my roommate was moving out so I was gonna have an open room in my apartment. I ended up telling her that if she ever needs a place to go for a night or to even move into that she is absolutely welcome, and she pretty much said yes on the spot, but warned me that it would take a long time for her to be ready. 

Since then, she‚Äôs told me more about her situation. She ran away from home and moved in with this guy when she was 16, and mind you, this vile dude was my age when he had her do that so not only is he an abuser, he‚Äôs a groomer. He constantly insults her, tells her she‚Äôs useless and that he hates her and doesn‚Äôt even want her around, so the abuse goes beyond physical as well. From what she‚Äôs told me, there is nothing left but a trauma bond in their relationship, and she tells me everyday how she can‚Äôt wait for it to be over. 

Currently, she still wants to move in with me whenever she can, and I‚Äôve made sure she‚Äôs still comfortable with that plan. I try not to push her to do it too hard because I know just dropping everything in your life and leaving on a dime is no small choice, and as well as that I know she‚Äôs trying to avoid doing the same thing that got her into that situation in the first place. I guess what I need guidance on is, what can I do besides just wait? Should I get the police involved if I ever see a physical sign like that again? Should I be encouraging her more? Will I be putting myself, or worse her in danger by inserting myself into her life like that?

Before then it was emotional and mental, but now I fear for the safety of my pets and belongings. 

My partner choked, punched, and slashed at me, I have a very obvious slash on my neck from her, as well as bruises on my face. I'm trying to cover up at work. She broke flower vases, cups, pictures,and other glass all over the house, and then picked up the glass to attempt to cut herself with it.
I'm worried because she is 4'10, and I'm a 5'11 man, I'm not in any incredible physical danger for the most part, I would never hit a woman, and to quite honest it would take a lot for my to fight anyone in general, I'm a non violent person. She has admitted to me before she faked injuries to get her last partner in jail. She claims her last partner was physically abusive, I believed her before, but now I'm unsure. I would never hit anyone, or destroy anyone's belongings, but I'm afraid if I try to leave she will blame these things on me, or hurt my dog.

I had been saving money prior to this lease, I never thought she would get physical, but I could see the trend of other kinds of abuse start to snowball, so I will be financially ok without her, and she should be relatively financially ok without me, so I'm not too worried about starting over, even if I have to leave most of my belongings behind if I need to escape. I really just need my ESA dog.

 I'm on a lease with her for 11 months, and I'm aware that domestic abuse is an avenue to being able to break a lease without penalty, but I'm scared she will beat herself up and try to stick me with the charges instead. I'm a non-violent person, I don't believe in it, but I fear that just like her previous partner, due to the size difference of us both, that they will just believe her if she goes that route.

 Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thank you so much for your time.

I'm the the male in a m/f relationship, we're the same age, close to 30s. We both have drinking issues, but she is a violent and angry drinker. I am not, I go to school, go to work. I've never been arrested, never really lost my shit before. ""High functioning"" alcoholic as it's described. Not saying it's good, I just keep to myself and don't really make noise. We got together long after I knew her from adolescence (6-7 years since we both graduated when we got together) so I was a little more willing to look past the minor things because we had a little bit of a bond. But the minor things became major things, quickly and unexpectedly.

After multiple domestic disturbances in which she was removed from our (my) place, I called in 1 her family and a neighbor called in the other two. Fighting over nothing, yelling screaming, threatening self harm threats any time I try to break it off (turns out she has a history of this) I had just bought the house, she has had no job, and paid 0 bills for 6 years (and she is not on the deed). I was originally Ok with the cooking/cleaning being her responsibility while I cover 90+% of expenses, and she was too. Well the 3rd time she mad a scene, she assaulted a cop and resisted arrest (she's like a 120 pound girl) and he knew her from before and they actually took her. 

I refused to pick her up obviously, giving her the keys was letting her right back into my life. Almost immediately she had to move in with her family in a bordering state, she received a domestic assault charge getting in a fight with her direct family, I had 0 to do with, she was taken to court by the state. I know this from digging because the conditions of getting her things back to her family was very odd, like they could not individually contact her any time they came to pick her things up and a simple question came up like ""where is it? Do you know what she means by this?"" She has a pending court case for that still now, and this was 1 1/2 ago, anyone who knows knows, post Covid judges in rural areas are pushing dates back and back and back unless you're violent felon level.

She was sober for a year. I let her back in like a fucking idiot (but wait there's more) a little more than a year ago. She cleaned up. And we had an awesome relationship for over 400 days. She got into a fight with her family one random night relapsed instantly. Puking, spilling shit everywhere. Started fights again. Neighbors and her family called once each again. She'd been taken away same fashion and brought to county finally after she assaulted a cop right in front of me AGAIN.

This is where it gets to the point where I'm right now absolutely furious and like... I'm about to become the bad guy with how angry I am after being 100% cooperative and level headed the whole time. She's assaulted a cop twice, resisted arrest twice, she's on probation or whatever for domestic assault, and violated every condition in the book. Surely something's going to stick. One day later, while I'm at university, county gives her a personal drive back to the same residence (my home) the incident occurred. And the maintenance guy in my complex let her in without my permission. I call the cops and I'm a little salty. They throw it back but I kind of stand up for myself. ""Well you've let her back in"" yeah well I fuckin didn't do it this time and that was over a year ago, she was hand delivered back to my door and given access without permission. To which he tells me I have to evict her, even if she pays no bills, and has a criminal record for domestic assault, and they've seen her like 6 times under the same circumstances.

So I look at him and I say, ""so after everything that's happened, that's it? That's all I can do?"" ""Yes, do you know how many times we've been here."" I agree with him, ""yeah too much, but how many times has it been because of my behavior?"" I ask him ""how come every time she comes back to me from you guys and now county she's loaded with bruises and now a fresh black eye, but whenever you come here to respond she's untouched."" 

He was there the night before so I ask him,""you were here last night, see that black eye (pretty solid one), it wasn't here last night when she left here was it?"" He kind of backtracks and says yeah no she didn't have any marks last night. I'm just trying to push back at the notion that we're just trash and I beat her in secret and she's lashing out. I've never laid hands on her.

So I'm stuck with her after all this in this very moment. My mother just died this past week. One night later she starts getting hammered and taking pills. Saying that it is because ""she is so sad for me and it's hard for her to handle it."" My mom. Then she starts fights again. I'm doing pre med classes for 7+ hours and figuring out my mothers arrangements the Past two nights, and she's left a burning stove top on and a panini press on for no reason that almost set the cabinets on fire at 1 am. Shes puking, can't form a sentence, most selfish person I've ever seen when she's drunk. And she is NEVER a manageable drunk. So the second ""half"" of the story after the long and good sobriety stint has all taken place in the last two weeks and the burning shit, almost starting fires, puking everywhere, falling all over the place, accidentally breaking shit from stumbling and starting fights over me saying a single word about her not acting like a toddler (in a nice way).   

Am I actually like powerless to do anything in this situation without evicting her? Her names not on a single bill, she hasn't paid a dollar. She has a criminal record, pending sentencing for domestic assault against her family (watch it get dropped) and a consistent record of resisting arrest, putting her hands on officers, and basically making massive public scenes.

I'm getting the vibe the police either do not like me, don't want to deal with it or they're basically just waiting for one of us to snap and go so far over the line one of us will actually get convicted. I'd never say us in the past, but at this point I feel cornered, and if they don't do something soon, something bad is going to happen and it's either going to be her putting me in danger in my own home (again) or me taking matters into my own hands to stop her from doing it.

Sorry for any misspellings or repetitions. I'm like shaking typing this out. Has anyone had a situation where someone will NOT let you break up with them, stay in your home, and when you finally get them out, they get off Scot-free (again) and delivered back to your door. and when you contact the same people from the very same night before they basically tell you too bad?

I just couldn‚Äôt ignore anymore this gut feeling (maybe more than that) that this man was capable of killing me and/or my dogs. 

Recovery has been really hard and long. The first few months I was terrified all the time and dealing with symptoms of PTSD. Something that helped me was that even though we continued to work for the same institution, I was in another area and I hardly ever saw him. A couple of months ago I was offered a promotion that meant relocating to an area where I would see him more often and the possibility of having to ‚Äúcollaborate‚Äù in certain things became a reality. Still, it wouldn‚Äôt be often and it was what I‚Äôve always wanted for myself professionally. But last week, finally I had to share some responsibilities with him. At the beginning I‚Äôd only communicate with him through other people, but after a few days it became obvious that he wasn‚Äôt willing to do his part. 

And I snapped. I went to his office to confront him. I wasn‚Äôt able to even put a foot inside, was shacking and my voice was tense. I demanded him to tell me whether I‚Äôd had to pick up his slack. And shockingly (not really) he blamed me. I didn‚Äôt even get a straight answer, had to do most of his part myself and I can feel he‚Äôs mad at me. I‚Äôm not scared but still angry. I cannot accuse him of doing anything wrong because with other people he‚Äôd say that I could do anything I wanted and he‚Äôd support it, you know, looking good always. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to handle the next time this happens. I don‚Äôt want to feel obligated to share what happened to me. I don‚Äôt want to feel pressured to talk to him. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle moments like these?",2025-02-22 02:13:12,2025-03-17 03:08:39,help

I don‚Äôt know what to do.,Practical_Target7167,0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1hqlgjr/dv_please_help_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"I have been with my kids father for 9 years broke up 2 times in the 9 years due to drug addiction and domestic violence. Fast forward to us getting back together in 2021 . We had a good year and a half and then after that he invite his drug addiction father into out home and later relapsed again . I was pregnant with my 4 baby and he was abusing me . He had been arrested for DV and also I left because he suffers from mental illness. 
I took him to court and he then did the same and lied to the judge and the court so they give him temporary custody. I put a RO on him so he won‚Äôt be able to take my  kids .  He lied to CPS and they should up at my house and never found signs of abuse towards the kids .
 Then when the judge was going to finally hear my side of the story  he asked for a continuance and then asked me and my attorney to negotiate with him and that he will do whatever I want . Mind you he also had a SA charge on him. 
    My attorney told me to accept and so we did but we made a agreement and the agreement has not been yet signed by the judge we sent it like 4-5 time he returned it .  Well he has been threatening me after I didn‚Äôt want to get back with him.  Can he use it in court that I don‚Äôt want to let him see the kids ? It only been two months since we went to court .. is too soon for him to have them unsupervised. He has not changed because you don‚Äôt go from having a history of drug addiction and domestic violence and mental illness to being cured in 2 months 
I seen this before he was sober for 3 years and still relapse so why would I trust he changed in 2 months . 
  He sent me threatening emails a few days ago and I want to make a police report .
 He said ‚Äú you are going to pay for keeping the kids from me and my family ‚Äú I got something for you coming in January‚Äù that‚Äôs around me and his sons bday and he plans on seeing him.
  I don‚Äôt trust him. I feel he is going to go to court and say we don‚Äôt have a agreement and that I‚Äôm keeping the kids . When in reality we barely went to court and the judge has not signed the papers yet .  What do I do‚Ä¶
   I have videos , texts , pics of him abusing me and also in front of our kids .. I have texts of him admitting this I have a lot of evidence to backup what I am saying.  Before I left July 28th he was holding me hostage took my phone and turned the internet off I couldn‚Äôt communicate with anyone and he threatened to kill me and punch my teeth in while I was holding our newborn. He had cameras all over the house to spy on me . He would control where I could watch tv in the house and I had to share my location everywhere I went . He accused me constantly of cheating when I was pregnant even with his dad and friends . 
There so much more he did but what do you guys think I should do? If I let the kids go with him  he will definitely take my kids since my case was dropped when we chose to negotiate we rally don‚Äôt have a custody order and I know the police cant remove them to give them to him but if I willingly let them go he doesn‚Äôt have to return them and that‚Äôs why he wants me to let the kids go to his house 6 hrs away. 
My daughter has PTSD and anxiety attacks after leaving the abuser . The kids don‚Äôt want to live with him but one of my boys does .",2024-12-31 18:59:08,2025-03-17 03:08:40,help

I couldn‚Äôt push her back because she‚Äôs actually surprisingly strong so all i said was for her to not touch me. i‚Äôm so sick of living with her i can‚Äôt deal with it- i can‚Äôt deal living with a narcissistic abusive manipulative bipolar or borderline stuck up bitch. it‚Äôs so hard dealing with her everyday and i don‚Äôt like complaining about it to my best friend because her family life is worse so what i go through sounds so nice compared to hers. so i came on reddit to ask how do i deal with her? She literally loves my dad‚Äôs DOG more over me. if she had to choose between that dog or me, it‚Äôs be the dog. why do narcissists love animals? she always degrades me, saying i‚Äôm not right and she‚Äôs right because she‚Äôs older,  she‚Äôs punched me once- but it was on the back because i turned around and i didn‚Äôt get any bruises so it obviously wasn‚Äôt that bad. but she‚Äôs unpredictable so i‚Äôm always scared when i argue with her because i don‚Äôt know how she‚Äôll hurt me . she‚Äôs kicked the back of my leg in when she was arguing with me over my pet lizard, she punched me in the back a few times when she told me off for leaving the lights on in the kitchen even tho i was literally in there making toast, she‚Äôs thrown shit at me like books and sandals lol. but today was the worst imo, she‚Äôs never done anything like that before which is making me scared it‚Äôs only gonna get worse. She starts arguments over tiny things and then says i started it which is why it‚Äôs hard for me to be the bigger person sometimes because i get tired of her bullshit. argued with me because i closed a curtain. that‚Äôs one of them so can you imagine the other things she started arguments about!!! stupid things. and i can‚Äôt do anything about it. i want to report her to a mental hospital is that possible? like call the mental hospital and tell them i have concerns for her because she fucking belongs there. I can‚Äôt believe that horrible people like her can just go about there day after doing and saying the most hurtful thing? do narcissists lack empathy? she only has empathy for animals or characters in TV shows. she hates me because i‚Äôm younger than her- someone told me it‚Äôs because i mirror how she was when she was younger and i remind her of herself? She‚Äôs always competing with me as well when i don‚Äôt think the exact same way as her ‚Äúsomethings wrong with me‚Äù apparently i‚Äôm a gaslighter too? i don‚Äôt think so. help me because  i‚Äôm either going to kill HER or she‚Äôs going to kill ME or i‚Äôm going to kill MYSELF. she‚Äôs threatened to kill me a few times but never acted  on it which makes me scared and she just came in my room before telling me ‚Äúyour going to go out and empty the dishwasher right now and clear the bench if you want your money‚Äù so i said i guess i‚Äôm not getting my money because i don‚Äôt to do anything for her after what she said and did. she‚Äôs really money greedy as well so she probably just wanted an excuse to not give it to me.

She is a stay at home mom to their two young children so has no income of her own. She is estranged from almost all of her family, and all of her relatives/friends live out of state. What pisses me off the most is that CPS has been involved with their family, but have not done anything because the kids are not being physically abused. They just made the husband (and my friend) go to therapy which has not helped. The husband has hit my friend/kicked her in the ribs, and is apparently still threatening to beat her regularly. CPS actually called me because she gave them my phone number as someone they could interview since she has no other close relationships here. I straight up told them that the husband is dangerous and my friend has no way to get out without financial support. They still have not helped her find any resources.

I have encouraged her to leave even if it meant going to a shelter. I have encouraged her to get a job to start squirreling away some money to leave, but she says she can‚Äôt afford childcare and any government assistance in that department takes too long to get. Plus the husband would just take any money she made if he knew she had a job. She claims that any of the local domestic violence resources have not been helpful. I understand that she feels very stuck in her situation but to be honest I think she hasn‚Äôt put much effort into making anything better for herself either.

I wish that I could offer her and her kids a place to stay temporarily but it‚Äôs just not a possibility.

I took to trial and the jury was hung,  2nd trial i was found guilty though I was the victim.    So much rests on he said / she said bullshit and she cries and plays vicim well so what else can I do?  

I haven't any proof other then the 5 people who watched it all and literally sat and said it didn't happen as she described. 

She continually stonewalls me and takes our son and disappears and refuse to even send a txt message what is going on.   Just removes him from school, disappears with him and calls 911 and says "" I""m scared""  and points to me.  Causing huge issues obviously.  

Resulting in weeks and months of court cases and warrants and outright abuse by this woman. 

  
What can a man do or turn to when dealing with delusional nonsense like this?  The police no matter what, point to me doing the wrong when i'm not.

1ie7tal,Help me confirm my suspicions re: bipolar ex,No_Celery9390,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ie7tal/help_me_confirm_my_suspicions_re_bipolar_ex/,"  
Many years ago, I dated a man who was bipolar (and unmedicated) but did not tell me until AFTER I fell for him. I ignored the red flags because he seemed \*so genuine\*.

He kept it together for the first several months and was very sweet, lots of love bombing. For my half birthday, he planned a special day-long date where we had a great time. This was right before a mutual friend was coming into town from across the country. We'd been counting down the days til he arrived, excitedly making plans for his visit. 

The day our friend arrived, my ex had a MASSIVE manic episode that was like a nitrogen bomb exploded, total Jeckyll & Hyde. He said it was because his ex was threatening child support isues. Our friend and I spent the entire week dealing with his tantrums and trying to talk him into getting help. He threw a tantrum at a restaurant with several of his own friends present, and we talked him down, but then he whispered insults only I could hear. Another night, he told an embarrassing story I had specifically asked him not to tell, then expected me to hold back his hair while he puked from stress.... I am still completely traumatized by that week and everything that followed. He claimed his episodes were usually not that bad, ie that was an outlier, and only happened once or twice a year. 

After that, he said he was getting treatment, and we got back together and broke up several times in the span of a few months. I never saw his sweet side again, except briefly while he was apologizing, then straight back to being a snarling asshole. All of a sudden, he claimed he had ""daily cycles"" that justified his outbursts all day every day, which does not match his earlier claim that the nitrogen bomb blast was an outlier. 

There was also an element of reproductive coercion that I only recognized as such very recently. Very early on and throughout our relationship, he was surprisingly casual about birth control for a grown, sexually experienced man who said he didn't want more kids. There was an unprotected sex incident, then he talked me out of 2 different types of BC. The last incident involved breakup sex where he broke our explicit agreement to pull out (while also wearing a condom). 

At the time, It was like the person I'd fallen for, who'd seemed so genuine, had died. At first, I believed his narrative -- that he was a sweet guy ""but for"" the bipolar, which took over him like a demon -- and I took him back many times as a result.

What I have realized in the past few weeks is that the following elements of his narrative do not add up:

\- He knew he was bipolar years before we met, but did not tell me until it was too late. At the time, I'd assumed he was embarrassed, or in denial. That doesn't make sense though; this had been going on for YEARS, and he'd had plenty of experience dating during that time. I'm pretty sure I met him right after a similar episode where he dumped a previous girlfriend. He knew exactly what was going to happen when we started dating. 

\- He knew his bipolar was severe and had gone to a crisis center at one point years prior. This makes it hard to believe his claim that the nitrogen bomb episode was an outlier. 

\- While we were dating, he did not want to take bipolar medications because of potential side effects. This is hard to believe, or at least simplistic, given the crisis center piece. I think he wanted to jerk me around and have an excuse for his tantrums. It also shows he had \*no intention\* of getting treatment and \*fully intended\* to jerk me around with the bipolar as cover. 

\- It strikes me as very odd that he arranged the daylong date right before his episode hit. He wanted to paint our day date as our last moment of peace in a ""star crossed lovers"" scenario of true love marred by mental illness. It's weird that he chose that instead of just saying he was about to have a breakdown. 
Edit: He referred back to that day date to get me back and get sympathy: ""I want you to remember me as the sweet guy who could make your half birthday the most magically perfect day -- not the unhinged slob I am today.""

\- What's weird too is that he never returned to that nice, sweet guy ever again except to apologize for various tantrums. If he really loved me with his real, sweet self, it seems he would have reverted back to normal and sought treatment once the mania subsided. 

\- I also question the ""randomness"" of his episode hitting the day our friend arrived. He'd known about our friend's plans for MONTHS but opted to blast us both with his unmitigated bipolar symptoms he knew about at least a day prior for our day date??? Fighting with his ex was not a new thing either, ie. was he really THAT upset over it, or was that a cover for his ruse:

I can't help but wonder if he planned the entire thing as a stunt to rope my friend into his bipolar narrative. If he could get me and everyone else convinced of that, he'd have an excuse to rail on me and get sympathy for it. It would also be more believable for me to actually have his child if I thought the sweet guy was in there somewhere. 

I guess I am just looking for backup on my conclusions. This has been hanging over my head for many years.  ",2025-01-31 05:30:05,2025-03-17 03:09:58,help

Not so much physically, she‚Äôs only hit my gf a few times in recent years.

But 100% emotionally and mentally. She‚Äôs been dependent on her mom for sure, so she‚Äôs kinda lived with the abuse for a while. Mind you, she has two baby girls and needs help a lot. So the mom was there to help her.

But the mom is psycho, and has told my gf to give up her two kids thousands of times. ‚ÄúJust sign the papers‚Äù she says every chance she gets. 

Now she‚Äôs going psycho and making false claims to CPS and getting the baby daddy to make threats as well (my gf already has full custody and a DVRO on the baby daddy). 

I am willing to have my gf and her two babies move in with me, but want to try to get a RO on the mom so she can‚Äôt harass us. One time they were over at my house and the girls were asleep but the mom didn‚Äôt want them sleeping at my house so she showed up at midnight pounding on the front door and demanded that we take the girls back‚Ä¶ 

My gf is scared. She thinks her mom actually could steal her kids (because of how much support the mom has given her and the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù of that support). She also thinks her mom will send someone to beat her up even if she gets the RO granted so ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù. 


I don‚Äôt know what to do. My gf has brought up getting an RO against her mom for 4+ months now, but I always had hopes the mom wouldn‚Äôt be so stupid. Today was a final straw because she opened a CPS case against us and contacted the baby daddy. Absolutely insane.

How do I get my gf to set aside her fears and take the next steps in removing her abuser from her life?? ",2025-02-28 08:39:06,2025-03-17 03:09:59,help

Although we have been together since we were 15. I tried to break up with him several times through high school and college, but was never successful through the years I've dealt with so much immaturity and disrespect. For instance, when I got pregnant at just 19 with her oldest daughter, he missed our ultrasound appointments to hang out with his friends. He has always prioritized video games over time with me or his children.

As we've aged into our 30s, I feel like we are growing apart. I haven't felt connected to him in years. I have resentment that I cannot explain where it comes from.

Our marriage grew stale. Our sexual relations diminished. There are many times I can recall not wanting to have sex but him forcing me to by throwing tantrums and treating terrible for the entire day if I did not comply.

He lost his job in July due to a work accident. He says that I was not there for him like a good wife should have been.

I have tried to separate from him 3 times this year (Feb, Aug and Nov). In November we got into an argument when he had been drinking. I tried to leave the house with my daughter (10F) and he stood between my door and car so I could not close the door. He was yelling and pushing my face away, grabbed my car keys and threw them into the woods. He took my phone and started punching it several times. My daughter was in the backseat and witnessed everything. She was terrified and called a friend at 2 AM and that friend woke up her mom.

I accepted my defeat since I no longer had my car keys or phone and decided to go back inside and pleaded with him to go bed. I laid my daughter down and he begged me to come outside with him. I complied. As I followed him down the hallway, I could see that he was holding a rifle. As we got to our den, we struggled over the rifle I was in tears, sobbing, and pleading with him. ""What are you doing?"".

He says this was the only way since he had laid hands on me earlier that evening by shoving my face. It was nearly a 20 minute standoff outside with me standing in from of the rifle. Him talking about hurting himself, and also apologizing for hurting me.

A few minutes after that, there was a knock at our front door. It was the police. They pulled us out separately to talk to us. I told them everything and he denied it all.

Because he refused to leave the home. I had to leave. My 10-year-old was able to go with me, but my three year-old had to stay. It broke my heart, but there was nothing that cops could do since he refused to let me take her.

I went back the next day.

Two weeks later, a similar incident occurred. This time my children were at my in-laws and we got into a fight again while he was drinking. My oldest had called crying wanting to come home, which she did frequent. She suffers herself from anxiety and depression. I told him I was leaving to get the kids, but had intentions to come home with them. On my drive to get them, he called me in a rage telling me to turn around. That if I did not come back for him, he would kill himself. He would blow his brains out, and my blood would be on his hands. I was so scared and knew that I could not bring my daughters back to that situation. I called the police and asked for a welfare check on my husband.

Long story short, he had a standoff with the police and was admitted to a psychiatric facility for four days.

I have not been back with him since and it's been nearly 2 months. He has not made it easy as he blames me for the way that he acted for things that I have done in my past in our relationship. One day, he will be seem to be making progress and respect my boundaries and the next he is losing his mind and calling me nonstop.

I am in therapy, working with a divorce coach and reading self help books. He has done nothing. He says that he is sober and blames all of his previous problems on alcohol, but I still see the same actions and lack of respect and boundaries in his sober self.

I feel like all of this is my fault. I have cheated in the past. Am I responsible for his actions? I have divorce papers that I have not signed because feel accountable. How do I move forward?",2024-12-22 22:16:21,2025-03-17 03:10:02,help

My mother and I have been giving her advice, but it seems like all the common ways to get out of this situation have been prevented already. For example, we have tried to get photo and video evidence by being in call with her when things happen, but her father shuts off her devices, and i mean he either powers them down or takes them out of the room. So, neither I nor she can collect video or audio evidence. We called the police for a wellfare check on her, but the moment he learned she was autistic, the officer began to disregard her. The most evidence we have is of a photo of a scar she has on her foot from being beaten as a child. When she was younger, child services were called because he had been locking her in the basement, but they left since he began behaving while they were there. We have reason to suspect her mother is either an enabler, or a former victim of her father's abuse. Her two younger siblings, 14F and 15F also like to bully her because she's autistic. They won't let her get a drivers license, and keep both her cards and her legal documents away from her.  I want to help, but it seems like every plan we try gets shot down in the worst of ways.

1iwjvx2,Wife‚Äôs Ex-Husband Abusing Current Partner. Help,LiteraryConstruction,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iwjvx2/wifes_exhusband_abusing_current_partner_help/,"Hello lovely sub-reddit! Hoping you can assist me with this sensitive topic, as my wife and I feel very caught in the middle and unsure how to proceed: 

Some background information: My wife and I have been together for two years. She has two children from a previous marriage (7 and 11). Her ex-husband has been with his partner for about the same amount of time that we‚Äôve been together. Custody is split 50/50 (week on/week off). The ex‚Äôs partner also has kids from a previous relationship (3 - ages 3, 10, and 14). My wife and I own a home together. The ex and his partner currently live at his house, but are planning to move soon. The co-parenting relationship between my wife and her ex, and between the four of us is contentious. We get along much between with the ex‚Äôs partner than we do with him, as he is a clinically diagnosed narcissist, with bi-polar disorder and severe anger management issues. Almost every joint decision is a struggle/fight, and it‚Äôs caused a lot of issues over the past few years. There is no formal parenting plan in place. 

The issue: Over the past year+, the ex‚Äôs partner has been secretly confiding in my wife and I that my wife‚Äôs ex is abusing her. It runs the gamut from yelling in her face, smashing dishes, punching holes in the wall, escalating to putting his hands on her (pushing, shoving), etc. He also sexually coerces her, treats her like she‚Äôs ‚Äúonly good for one thing‚Äù, tracks her phone location, spam texts her when she‚Äôs out of his sight ‚Äî the list is endless. These episodes happen as patterned behavior, cropping up about once every 2-3 months. He has allegedly gotten support through therapy and anger management classes, but clearly that‚Äôs all been a bunch of BS. The last time this happened (in late Sept) she said she was going to leave him‚Ä¶ and didn‚Äôt. She knows exactly what‚Äôs happening to her, agrees it‚Äôs not acceptable and doesn‚Äôt try to make excuses for his actions. We offer her support where we can, and always remind her if she needs help getting out, we would gladly do so without issue. 

She called my wife the other day and told us it happened again; this time with the kids present (which is a first to our knowledge). They were arguing after everyone went to bed, which culminated with him pushing her outside, and beating the crap out of her car hood/mirror. My step-daughter (11) heard the door slam, woke up and went outside, and caught the tail end of all of this. From what we were told, they walked her back inside, the ex‚Äôs partner calmed her down, reassured her she was ok and then left to cooldown (leaving her phone at the house so he couldn‚Äôt track her). The ex proceeded to spam text her threats of leaving the kids alone to come find her (which she shows my wife and I). She ended up staying at a friend‚Äôs house overnight, returning the following morning. 

Here‚Äôs where we‚Äôre looking for guidance ‚Äî what should our next steps be? 

- My step-daughter hasn‚Äôt mentioned anything about the event. She is extremely sensitive and we don‚Äôt want to pressure her into talking about it because we worry that when something happens to the ex (his partner leaves, custody changes, etc, she will blame herself). We also worry she will say something that‚Äôll make the ex realize that his partner has been talking to us and we don‚Äôt want to jeopardize her safety.  

 - We‚Äôve talked to the partner every day since the event and she‚Äôs told us he‚Äôs been ‚Äúvery apologetic‚Äù (as most abusers are) and has been on his best behavior. She has told us she‚Äôs leaving but unfortunately, we don‚Äôt believe her. 

- We do not believe he‚Äôd ever place a hand on the kids, but we don‚Äôt trust an incident like this won‚Äôt happen again which also constitutes child abuse.

- All we have is hearsay from the partner (plus all the evidence she‚Äôs shown us) so we feel stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to inserting ourselves. If we do a wellness check, there‚Äôs nothing actively happening at the house so we‚Äôre afraid they‚Äôll say ‚Äúeverything fine‚Äù and that‚Äôll be that

- If my wife and I seek legal counsel to get temporary full time custody, what evidence would need to be presented to substantiate that claim? Also we are worried if we do that, he‚Äôll take his anger out on his partner 10x worse if she stays

It just seems like there‚Äôs so many factors and we‚Äôd really appreciate anyone‚Äôs perspective on best next steps.

Hi I posted this yesterday but I got locked out of my account so had to come on on this one as I didn‚Äôt even see it I got any replies. 

So 8 months ago I had to ring the police he got arrested and we haven‚Äôt spoken since. Cops pursuing charges of controlling & coercive behaviour & assault. (Assault was not major, slight injury to my eye, affecting my sight, not permanently & wasn‚Äôt a visible injury) & locked me in wouldn‚Äôt let me leave, this lasted around half hour maybe less, until I got on to police emergency. He‚Äôs been violent before probably about 2 year ago, multiple times back then, pushing shoving spitting a bite, slaps ect, aggression such as smashing things etc. back then I‚Äôd be scared in the moment but more scared that he was ending it with me, because that‚Äôs what he‚Äôd be telling me, that he was done with me ect. Prior to recent assault it was all verbal & emotional, he said they were regular rows & I was the cause, I believed  this but my friends / family said it was abuse, I didn‚Äôt know what to think apart from feeling depressed hopeless useless & just sad & embarrassed that I‚Äôd turned him against me. He‚Äôd often try to be affectionate but I normally refused because either I‚Äôd worry I‚Äôd do something wrong & he‚Äôd get upset with me or he‚Äôd get angry if I wanted to get a drink or move for example (sometimes small things like that would really annoy him) he also said I didn‚Äôt spend enough time with him but I used to get worried about seeing him cause the arguments & how he would speak to me would get to me. I think over those things now & feel like I didn‚Äôt put enough effort in. Because I was always down and probably didn‚Äôt try but I‚Äôd find it hard to forget how he‚Äôd spoke to me or something & then me being quiet would cause more problems.  I felt I‚Äôd made the right decision 2 weeks after the assault, I kept remembering how scared I‚Äôd been & thought I need to stay away, now though I wake up crying about him, I have nightmares where I realise I‚Äôve lost him, I feel I‚Äôve thrown my future away. The love was real and makes me feel like I wish I‚Äôd stayed even though it was hard because it was my soulmate. I‚Äôve dropped charges with the police and reached out to him but he has ignored me. I have tried for the last months to block him out but I couldn‚Äôt keep lying to myself about how I feel, I wish he‚Äôd contact me. I am so so sad all of the time and don‚Äôt see it ever stopping. How will I ever know if it was abusive or if I was just a bad gf & drove him to those things.

I feel like breaking down even as I write this 


2 years and a few months ago I met a man and went down a whirl wind of a relationship and I am now broken and lost. Let‚Äôs call this man Steve. When I met Steve I was in my clinical year of PA school near the end. I had a few months left. Once I graduated I moved in with him and my father was dying of cancer. I was easy going at first but when the relationship first started he slept with an ex of his and he also had 3 kids by two different women. I was easy going. His sleeping with the ex hurt my heart because I liked him but we weren‚Äôt officially in a relationship so I knew it should not bother me. I was so easy going I even gave the mother of his youngest two kids, let‚Äôs call her Stephanie, medical advice was kind and offered for us to all move into a bigger home down the hill to raise the kids in an easier home. It was going well until he became secretive of his relationship with Stephanie and Stephanie started saying hurtful things about me like not wanting me around. I‚Äôll admit it. I became insecure. In hindsight the manipulation started from the moment he said hello

From early on in our relationship I was required to keep my location on. One day I had gotten lost and my car severely damaged and he had to come and find me and I was convinced it was a good thing he had my location. But I was not allowed to turn it off. When we first started dating I had to pass my boards and so he took care of me minimally for 3 months. And so after I passed my board I offered to do the same so he could go back to school to get his GED. He never did and I took care of the family for an entire year. Him me his kids and even my family. Everyone was getting every penny I had. Eventually the money going home stopped. I thought i was in control of my finances because the money was in my bank account but I ran every purchase by him and took on every expense. 

Things between him and Stephanie started to become hostile always fighting me and Steve are fighting it‚Äôs so much fighting. I‚Äôm super insecure now because I‚Äôm starting to love Steve and I want to build a family with him. I work hard. I work incredibly hard. I move me Steve and his 3 kids (one who lived with us full time) from a 1900 square feet house into one closer to 4,000 I wanted his kids to have everything I never did. I loved them so much. I made and stocked a playroom so they could have a place to go to entertain themselves and keep their toys. And stocked it with art supplies for the oldest daughter. For a little bit things were okay. Then the younger kids started telling me of threats their family was making to me physical wellbeing they were calling into our home talking to the oldest daughter talking about me. I got angry with Steve and told him to fix the problem he refused to fix it in front of me and said he fixed it one day but I didn‚Äôt believe him. The arguments started to escalate Stephanie became more and more disrespectful I became more and more insecure. And Steve became more and more disrespectful. 

Steve told me things like he wishes it was the olden days where he could beat women without consequence. And that all women were good for was reproduction (knowing I was having a hard time getting pregnant and we were trying for a baby). He told me I needed to much attention and should marry a women. The arguments started become worse. Steve started to make fun of my mental health. When we first got together I was on meds for bipolar disorder but I don‚Äôt think I was bipolar a psychiatrist I never knew asked me a question and I said sometimes I‚Äôm sad sometimes I‚Äôm not and they said boom you‚Äôre bipolar so I got off the meds. Steve started calling me a lunatic and insane and really beating me down mentally. I started getting high in marijuana to tolerate the behaviors and that made everything okay because I was passive and would not engage in any arguments. But on the weed I started getting paranoid about Steve. I felt dark energy around him and was so scared I went to a tarot reader who told me everything was going to be okay (I won‚Äôt dive into this story line right now) 

Fast forward in April of this year we fought and had a bad argument on his daughters birthday and made up he told me before we left the park while he kids were riding rides he would start hitting me. I was stupid and thought he was lying. I didn‚Äôt believe he would actually do it. I would be lying to you guys if I told you I remember the first time he ever hit me or how we got to the point of physically fighting all the time. But the fights got bad. One time in June I thought I was pregnant we went to a party I wanted to go home and we got into a fight by the end of the fight he had beat me so bad I had bruises all over my body. Then he sexually assaulted me for good measure. 

I‚Äôm not going to lie. He had sexually assaulted me before but I was too in love to call it that. I thought it was a man forcing a connection in the only way he knew how. He wasn‚Äôt rough at first he just kept going despite me saying no pushing him and crying through the whole thing.  But this time he was forceful. I noticed he was recording me in my anger but not him beating me so after he beat me so bad I had bruises and had to call off of work I met with a police officer who lied and said I could file a report just for paperwork purposes. I filed the report and long story short they arrested him I bailed him out and then like a coward lied and said I told a friend who made the report. After that things got worse. I never fought back after that. I had to much guilt over what I done and knew fighting wasn‚Äôt the way. He sexually assaulted me weekly if not almost daily. He beat me tried to break my hand and my jaw. Tried to choke me intentionally until I passed out. Told me he liked sexually assaulting me and that it was easier to take it. Told me when I misbehaved he wished to anally r**** me until I bled and he didn‚Äôt care if I had pain. 

One day we got into another fight over how he was treating his oldest daughter. She was so lonely. And I loved her so much she just wanted him to love her. Well he didn‚Äôt like that he yelled at her about the argument then told her he would kill me if she told me what he said. She got scared told her aunt who called CPS. She then called CPS and then told me. I then had to call CPS because I was a mandated reporter. And I left because of her. I left because I loved her and he was arrested again and I knew I couldn‚Äôt go back home. Whenever I had tried to leave in the past he would always use the kids against me. I knew my career was in jeopardy. I was so close to getting my doctorates degree and I knew I couldn‚Äôt survive there much longer. His daughter was starting to see and hear the abuse. We were both so scared. 

I left in July of this year. When I left he tried to extort me for money then tried to have me arrested for violating my own no contact Order

I write this to say why do I still wish he will come back? Why am I like a dog sitting in my home waiting to its owner to come back. I can‚Äôt have intimacy with anyone else. He made me tell him I was his property during sex one time and I did it. Like an idiot I did it. I know it‚Äôs a trauma bond f*#^ I know but why. 

He‚Äôs not coming back is he :(?

I‚Äôm so sick in the head. You guys have no idea how many people have sexually abused me since I left. I was scared because he said he would kill me if I left so I let another man spit in my mouth and force my into sex for protection. I then made friends with another guy who said he was working through trauma and he date raped me at a party with 4 of his friends. I am so broken I won‚Äôt even think about those things. I‚Äôm still stuck with Steve in that house. I mentally can‚Äôt process anything else. If I think about it. I start thinking bad things about my worth In this world 

I wish I could make everything stop. I work overtime every week because I can‚Äôt sleep and I can‚Äôt stop thinking of Steve. Please. Please help me. ",2024-12-05 04:43:30,2025-03-17 03:10:15,help

There‚Äôs been issues since the beginning but being dumb I overlooked them.. this is only my second relationship ever. We were long distance at first, he traveled to meet me and then I traveled to see him a month later, he fell on hard times and I stupidly allowed him to stay with me and my parents back in June. He was at our house a few months before my mother put him out & he went to a homeless shelter in my city where‚Äôs he been living ever since. As I said theres been issues in the relationship already as far as countless arguments, name calling, controlling behavior etc. It started getting physical back in July. We‚Äôve had at least 4  physical altercations in the past 8-9 months. A few days ago we went to the bar together. I got up to use the bathroom and when I came back there was another man sitting quite close to him but he was talking to the bartender so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I sat down and my boyfriend kept telling me to move over but I thought he was being funny so I didn‚Äôt. The man at the bar started arguing with everyone my boyfriend included. My boyfriend then started getting more aggressive with the man AND ME, calling me a bitch and saying he‚Äôll slap me in front of everyone. We left like 10-15 mins later. He said I wasn‚Äôt on his side and was trying to get attention from the other men and kept talking about how bad he would‚Äôve beaten the man in the bar.. as we‚Äôre walking to my house he‚Äôs talking shit to me and I‚Äôm trying to ignore him. He eventually hits me in the back of my head while standing in front of me trying to prevent me from going another way. He walked the whole way home about 4 blocks just hitting me. Pulling my hair.. pushing me.. actually ended up pushing me down to the ground in the snow and mud and when I said it was over he snatched my purse and my phone. Covered my mouth and tried to choke me multiple times so I wouldn‚Äôt scream and draw attention. Said I was tryna get him in trouble. It was midnight at that point. I tried to get him an uber home but he refused so I just kept the peace and let him stay until the next day.. I grew up seeing my mother deal with domestic violence and now I‚Äôm going through the same thing. I just want him to move back to his home state because as long as he‚Äôs here and as long as I‚Äôm the only person he knows out here I‚Äôm going to feel responsible for him. He also hasn‚Äôt gotten a job or an apartment in the 9-10 months he‚Äôs been here so I‚Äôve been supporting him financially as well. How do I leave?? What do I do??

1i3lvtt,How do I help my friend.,Square_Classroom3076,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1i3lvtt/how_do_i_help_my_friend/,"Okay so my best friend cut all contact with me over 8 years ago after dating this guy for about a year or so, then she got back in touch last year, I was still hurting so I didn't talk to her much then in about October she started to tell me how bad it was and how abusive he was, emotional and physical violence, he tried to strangle her multiple times and she was on the high risk of death list with the police. I even heard him abusing her, I helped her and she told me she had somewhere safe to go once we get her out. She was sleeping with a door wedge and against the door incase he tried to get to her in the night. Anyway we got her out with the help of police and she looked ao emaciated and scared, she practically collapsed into my arms. So her safe place turned out to be her ex's house and it turns out she never told me how controlling and belittling he was and is now even worse, so we are currently working on getting her to stay at my place as soon as she has somewhere safe for her dog to stay (we are limited by space and also have disabled cats and bunnies). We have a protection order out so he can't contact her and he is going to be charged as she documented quite a bit of evidence and sent me everything. I'm also giving evidence about what I witnessed.

Anyway,
She still talks about how much she still loves her abuser and how there were good times too and she misses him, how it was a lot of his autism that maybe made him so sadistic. How people have told her he has turned his life around now and while he used to drink about 2 liters of vodka a night he has now quit drinking completely which I find hard to believe in such a short space of time. I feel like he is putting on a show for everyone so he can get her back. It's like she is brainwashed. I don't know how to help her. Can anyone please offer any tips or advice. She quite likes to look into/research and watch documentaries about things like psychopaths as we both think he is a genuine psychopath. She text me last night and said this,
""I do love him and want to support him. he did awful things and my eyes are open but it never seemed as bad as others, because he seemed as scared of himself as me and we both didn't understand how to fix""

I am honestly terrified that she will go back and I will loose her again. I don't know if I can watch her make herself ill as she makes him her everything which is what happened at the start and he strung her along for a year and he said he had moved in with his parents as he was living in a house with his ex and then we caught him still living there, then he would say he would see her that day and not come and he even did this on Christmas day, I of course rushed over and picked up the pieces and brought her to mine for Christmas. 
I just feel so helpless when she talks like this and I don't know how to help her realise that he was always abusive, every time she cried he said it made him love her a degree less ect. I could go on but I don't want this to be even longer.
I appreciate anyone's help and thank you for reading my post. 
Thank you again.
If you have any questions I will do my best to respond but I may forget to, if I do I'm sorry in advance.

I never said anything like that, nor own any firearms. She then told her local court and my local court the same thing ( she lives in North Carolina and I live in Colorado, I haven't seen her in person for years) and they granted her a protection order. The school banned me from campus. I've never had any legal issues in my life besides a speeding ticket when there was a wildfire burning near my rents'house. 

While I know this forum is for victims of actual domestic violence, I need help at this point from a community like this because I really didn't say anything like it and I was taking the last class I needed to graduate from college, but I was banned from the school due to her word of mouth alone. 
I then lost my job at UPS too because they deliver to the school and because they didn't like the RO. 

There was another school shooting in the state a few days before this.
I understand the school and the courts did the right thing back then but I still have no idea why my ex did any of this. 

Because I was banned from campus and lost my job, and also because she's never ever done anything even remotely like this I couldn't believe it was really her doing it. I subsequently ignored the restraining order, to say that I never threatened to shoot anyone and asked her why she did this. Perhaps I was scammed or something in a very terrible way. I did not use any aggressive language, I just wanted to know why and/or how to fix this. She immediately filed a police report in both states that I contacted her, and I was arrested that night. I learned how to bond out of custody but then still tried to contact her again because my professors literally were rushing their kids back to their car when I walked out of walmart. She reported that I contacted her again I was arrested again.
 I then tried to contact her again and was arrested again. This went on for the last year basically. I kept violating the order because I couldn't and still can't believe she would do something like this. I was held in jail until I plead guilty to a dvpo violation and stalking (because I kept violating the order) I never got mad at her I just wanted her to undo this so I can have my own life back and have no idea what is going on on her end. I eventually found out she had started dating another guy before she ghosted me. She also filed all her stuff through a domestic violence nonprofit. They are acting off of her word of mouth and that I violated the ex parte order at all, even though the order was from her word of mouth too. 

I'm a biotechnology major and literally haven't even known anyone else in my life that has had an RO placed on them. 
I am posting this because I really have been telling the truth to the courts and school, but they keep choosing to believe her word of mouth over mine, I think because she reported all this as a domestic violence issue, so that gets both the court and the school's priority and support. My heart goes out to those people that are really suffering from domestic violence. I loved her though and have never done anything to her and she seemed happy with me. I have no idea what to do now. 
I don't want to try to legally fight this because I don't want to hurt actual domestic violence victims' efforts to get help in a system that already isn't always supportive of them. I know that people lying to the court about these things just makes it harder for other people to get restraining orders. I am so at a loss as to what to do ",2024-12-26 03:52:13,2025-03-17 03:10:24,help

I am really in need of help and community so here goes nothing. Been with my wife since teenagers and loved and lived for 16 years, married 6 years. Both of us were really stressed with Covid and since then things have been rocky. The violence started about 3 years ago, slaps and grabs escalating to chocking me where I started seeing black a year and a half ago. Not as bad since but always returning no matter the promises. I‚Äôm so ashamed and feel so weak that I let it get this far and go on so long. So many times I said THIS is the last time. Well this month she pushed my mom down the stairs, something about seeing someone else get hurt that finally made me see. 
Her past traumas are so deep and dark, truly horrific shit (not that mines not bad, but hers is worse and the ‚Äúreason‚Äù for the violence). I can‚Äôt reconcile in my head that I am the only one who‚Äôs ever been there for her, given her my love and life and everything. Somehow the narrative became that I was controlling and forced many aspects of the relationship against her will. Our careers, finances, all our choices she was there, actively participated and made decisions with me.

How can she not see that her violence makes me act against mine (can‚Äôt emotionally support her b/c frankly I‚Äôm afraid if I try to hold her she‚Äôll hit me).
Are there any men or women who have had such a deep and long love flip like that? I have been hearing her feel trapped in the relationship for sometime, how does that translate to beating me like a dog? Or how she thinks the lightbulb flickering is ghost communication? I‚Äôve been the only one for sometime long to help her, after I walked away I‚Äôm so scared she doesn‚Äôt even know these things are issues to address :(

I am a late 20s male. My friend Emily is late 30s female who was having an affair with an older male Jake. Her bf is Ryan who is around her age and they have been together for as long as I've known them.

Background

I met Emily through work a few years ago. I don't work there anymore but we've kept in touch and I now work a slow retail job. She visits me at work and sometimes we hang out in the back room playing games and talking. Sometimes she would bring Ryan with her but in the past few months he hasn't come and it's only been her. We talk about a lot of stuff but since Ryan hasn't been coming she seems to have opened up to me more. When we worked together Ryan would come visit. But we all noticed at work that sometimes he was a little aggressive with her and rude. He started to visit her at work more and more often until I left. I'm don't know how much he visits her now but she still works there part time while working somewhere else full time. Emily is a gem of a person. Generally upbeat always willing to give a helping hand and overall a nice person. When nobody is looking though you can tell how she feels just by looking at her face. I don't agree with her affair but I don't judge her for it.

When Emily does come visit. I'm mostly a listener and I give my opinion at the end. From the stories it sounded like Ryan was getting more and more controlling. I grew up in this sort of situation. I started to notice that she would be in pain a lot. She never said anything but I'd notice she'd flinch when she gets up. She'd have a slight limp sometimes or be holding her body in a weird way. IYKYK. She always had a story on how she slipped on the ice or how her dog knocked her over or some excuse. It worked for a little while as her stories all seemed possible. She started to say how she didn't want to be home so I told her that she's always welcome to visit at my store as we're open late and I even offered for her to come visit at my place with my roommates whenever I'm not working. The last couple months she hasn't visited as often and I just assumed that things were improving at home. Recently when she visits I've noticed her wearing makeup. She kept saying she was going out to events to meet new people and be more social. She's not a makeup person. But, then she started to wear makeup when i knew she was coming from work that's when I started to suspect. She said that she had been seeing someone named Jake. Since I didn't know how long she'd been seeing him I thought maybe it was him hurting her because the timing fit but she seemed happier. I know her private tastes are more on the rougher side so I told myself it was that. But she left her phone on the table unlocked one time when she went to the bathroom. I knew she was messaging Jake on and off so I took her phone and went into the app she talked to him on. He was the only contact so I took a picture of his info with my phone and put it back before she came back. I know this was a huge breaking of trust but I'm generally worried about her.

Lately her visits to me increased. So did her makeup. I asked how things are with Jake and she just said she wasn't seeing him anymore. Then why are her injuries increasing? If she's not seeing him then they should have stopped not gotten worse. It clicked. It's Ryan. Emily already has formed a plan to leave Ryan in a few weeks time. What caused the sudden increase. I dug a little and found out that in her fun times with Jake he had left a hickey. She tried to hide it from Ryan but he saw it. She blames herself because she feels guilty about the affair and she let Jake do it to her. But Jake knew she has a bf. To this point Emily has not admitted to Ryan being physically abusive towards her.

How I messed up

I sat with this info for a while but I went into my own rage about it yesterday. I downloaded the app that Emily talked to Jake on. I sent him a long message of what I suspect is going on. Then I deleted the app so I couldn't get a response. I don't know what I was thinking. What do I really expect him to do? They're not even a thing anymore. But he put a hickey on Emily which made her problems so much worse. I wanted him to know what his irresponsibility had done to her. Even if she says it's her fault it's his fault too. Well I guess Jake messaged her. She's mad at Jake for messaging she's mad at me for violating her privacy and getting involved. She says that I don't know what's going on and she's right. I'm mad at myself for getting involved but I couldn't sit by and do nothing if something worse were to happen to her. I'm mad at myself because now I took away what safe space she had with me. I want her to be able to be there for her if she needs me.

Now what do I do? I know they met on this site and I want him to see it as I didn't give much details in the message. But that's getting too involved again.

TL;DR I found out that my friend was having an affair that ended. I broke into her phone to get his contact info because I thought it was him being violent to her. But, it's most likely her bf. I contacted her affair guy behind her back. Now she's mad at me for getting involved but I want her to be ok.",2025-02-28 19:45:24,2025-03-17 03:10:28,help

My father has a problem with both alcohol and drugs. My mother and my father argue on a daily basis, so, for the sake of my mental health, i said i wouldn't get involved in their fights anymore. Yet, i'm afraid, because i know what they're both capable of when they argue. A few weeks ago, my mother threatened to kill herself, and she just wouldn't listen to a word my father said, so i obviously had to step in to prevent her from doing anything we would all regret. For this same reason, i have very bad anxiety problems, i can't sleep at night, thinking they'll start arguing any time soon, and what's even more horrific is that when they fight they ignore eachother. That isn't exactly the bad part, because that means there's no chance for fighting when they don't even speak to eachother, but the bad part is that they start talking and loving eachother again after a few days or weeks; meaning i can't have peace when that happens, because i know they'll start arguing again eventually. I've told my mother to leave the house, both of us, and she agrees, yet it all feels like an empty promise, because when she and my father sort things out between them, she forgets everything she says about leaving, and i'm condemned to stay here, knowing the cycle will repeat. I don't know what to do, i can't get a job to buy a plane ticket to go live with my sister, since where I live, minors can't work. This has taken a toll on my mental health, and i've considered ending my life in repeated occasions because of this.

I have spent all my savings on attorneys fees. During the temporary orders, my ex was told to bring my son to me asap (my ex kicked me out and refused to let me take my son) then my ex had my son for 3 days. When he brought him back to me, his face was bruised so badly.
For his 2 year check up, my son‚Äôs doctor confirmed that his mental development has DECLINED since his last visit (even before he kicked me out, he was not letting me near my son and was snatching him out of my arms). I‚Äôm in the state of Texas. We were never married. I‚Äôm so worried about my son and don‚Äôt want him to become another statistic.

1fuzjqp,I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm exaggerating things. Help pls,Other_Hall3539,8,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1fuzjqp/i_dont_know_if_im_exaggerating_things_help_pls/,"I (44/F) and my husband (44/M) got married about 18 months ago. This is the first marriage for both of us.

I‚Äôve never posted before on reddit, and this whole issue makes me feel sick to my stomach. I truly don‚Äôt even know what to say. Or whether I should post at all. Terrified is the main feeling. And guilt about causing my husband pain. 

I got married about a year and a half ago. I always assumed marriage was for life- that you just work on it and fix it as it bends, and hope it doesn‚Äôt break. 

There‚Äôs many issues. His anger for one. The way he speaks to me when unhappy. My way of catering to his displeasure, and willingness to do anything to avoid him being ‚Äúirritated‚Äù (ie angry) or upset. 

We have many differing values that clash. 
Some which put my job at risk- which is a huge deal for me.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. 
My parents are rather conservative but are absolutely wonderful people- they are loved for all they do for others. I absolutely adore them. 

I let slip some issues when I was really struggling and they are now kind of against my husband. I haven‚Äôt even told them most of it. 

My dad has suggested I take 3 months to try and sort the issues out between my husband and myself. But they are really unhappy with how he‚Äôs treated me at times so far. 

And I have to say it is at times- sometimes he‚Äôs lovely and caring and sweet. And I do love him. And the thought of breaking his heart really hurts. He has no clue I‚Äôd consider separating at all. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm doing stupid stuff like looking up toxic relationships quizzes and how to tell if you should work on it or leave? 

Please any questions I‚Äôll answer. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I‚Äôm 44 and he‚Äôs the same age. We knew each other at school but only recently reconnected. We both were in very toxic relationships prior to this. 

We seem to clash on different morals and values. For example:

I value financial security - he does not. He‚Äôs happy to live paycheck to paycheck which means we often borrow from his parents which leaves us behind for the following pay week. 
He is also quite verbally abusive in the workplace (my workplace also but we work in different sectors). He will steal things from work when he feels he is ‚Äúowed‚Äù or ‚Äúwronged‚Äù which I disagree with. 

He gets quite angry over various things - whenever anything‚Äôs ‚Äúin his way‚Äù he throws it but gets angry when I keep trying to tidy up so it doesn‚Äôt happen. He gets angry if I put his clean clothes away wrong or if the dog‚Äôs in his way, unfortunately the dog cops a lot of his anger/frustration. 

He is very verbally abusive when things go wrong with people - for example he will threaten restaurants if they get a delivery order wrong. But it‚Äôs not just that - he will actually tell them he will violate their children and wife if they don‚Äôt fuck off/do what he wants. It‚Äôs awful.

Hello, I‚Äôm (21F)  keeping myself anonymous for my safety and I‚Äôve also never done anything like this before, but I‚Äôm struggling to turn to anybody else as I feel like nobody understands or knows what to say.
So to sum it up, I‚Äôve recently got out of what I think was an abusive relationship and it‚Äôs not the first time I have been with him  (34M) and I should have learnt from last time but he told me things would be different but they weren‚Äôt I now realize. 
We broke up due to me having to have an abortion after falling pregnant as I‚Äôm not personally ready to have a child and the decision just wasn‚Äôt right for me at the time, he then went on to saying awful things like I decided without telling him, and I‚Äôm being stupid and my ‚Äòexcuses‚Äô aren‚Äôt good enough and I‚Äôm at my ‚Äòprime age‚Äô and I‚Äôd be ‚Äòready in 9 months‚Äô and I went and did it anyway after talking to him several times. He then threatened to come to my door and proceed to tell me if his friend found out what I did they‚Äôd set my house on fire and it just got worse. I then blocked him and have been trying to live as normal but it‚Äôs just so hard as I‚Äôm getting constant calls on no caller ID alongside voicemails and he‚Äôs coming into my work telling me I need to grow up and I shouldn‚Äôt be hurting its him that‚Äôs hurting as he‚Äôs had ‚Äòeverything taken‚Äô from him, and calls me disgusting etc. 

So from here I‚Äôm at a loose end on what to do as it still feels like he has so much control over my life and me and my mood, and I‚Äôm scared to go to work as he constantly comes in. I was looking into Clares law and doing a check but I don‚Äôt know if I fit the criteria with him being a now ex. 
I just don‚Äôt know where to turn and I‚Äôm paranoid all the time and it‚Äôs just so hard. I didn‚Äôt notice the signs or maybe became numb to them and now it‚Äôs too late and I feel so guilty and ashamed for letting this happen. And I‚Äôm so upset because I let him in and I feel like he‚Äôs just used it all against me,  I just need some guidance. 
Thank you.

I am reaching out to this community for help and guidance during one of the most challenging times of my life. I am in a toxic and abusive marriage where I am subjected to verbal, physical, emotional, and financial abuse. Despite the pain and fear, I am determined to leave this situation and rebuild my life, but I feel trapped and uncertain about my next steps.

I am a doctor pursuing my USMLE and working toward my career in the medical field. However, my situation is complicated as I am on a dependent visa and unemployed. My husband is my main sponsor, and my career and immigration status are deeply tied to him. This dependency makes it incredibly difficult for me to leave, but I know I must for my safety and future.

I am reaching out to ask for advice, resources, and support with the following:

1. **Shelter and Basic Needs**: I urgently need a safe place to stay and access to resources for food and basic necessities. Are there organizations or shelters that support women in abusive situations, especially those on dependent visas?
2. **Financial Assistance**: As an unemployed dependent, I have no savings. Are there programs, charities, or community resources that provide temporary financial aid or help individuals like me find work?
3. **Divorce and Legal Guidance**: I want to understand how to proceed with divorce without jeopardizing my visa status. Are there legal protections or pathways for someone in my situation to remain in the country and continue pursuing my career? I am also seeking affordable or pro-bono legal services for support.
4. **Support for My Career**: My dream is to complete my USMLE and establish myself in the medical field. Are there resources or organizations that assist women in abusive situations to continue their education and careers?
5. **Experiences and Encouragement**: If anyone has faced a similar situation, your experiences, advice, or even words of encouragement would mean so much to me.

I feel overwhelmed and scared, but I am determined to find a way forward. This community has always been a source of support and strength, and I am hopeful that someone here can guide me in the right direction.

Thank you for reading this and for any help you can provide.",2025-01-23 04:50:33,2025-03-17 03:10:37,help

He follows me from room to room even when I ask for space and refuses to provide space for me and insists I keep having a conversation when I‚Äôve told him over and over to stop, take a break, I‚Äôm at capacity, overwhelmed, can‚Äôt go on. I am level 1 autistic with severe ADHD and struggle with emotional regulation and the constant following sends me into a trigger response, when he doesn‚Äôt let up I snap, then that makes everything worse because he feels like he needs to protect me or something, and it usually ends with me having to leave the house(mostly on days he works I stay and just keep going from room to room because we have kids and obviously I can‚Äôt leave them). Usually this happens in mornings before he‚Äôs going to work. He will be late to work to continue to seek me out. 

Once he leaves for work, he will spend the entire day texting me about how he fucked up how he feels so bad he realizes the gravity of the situation. He literally gets it, he understands he validates, he‚Äôs not just trying to appease me. He‚Äôs not just trying to get me to stop having my feelings he literally will sit and have a conversation with me pretty much the entire day and take full accountability for everything and talk through with everything.

But then he comes home and even if I‚Äôve clearly stated that I need space or time or I‚Äôm not ready to have a conversation with him he always bitter and resentful and angry that he spent the whole day having a terrible day because of me. And I don‚Äôt wanna talk about what happened. I‚Äôm not validating him. I‚Äôm not a support person for him . From my perspective, I feel like I am being put through it and use as a punching bag then immediately turned around and expected to be a support beam. He starts laying on the guilt how he‚Äôs miserable and sorry and he‚Äôs the worst person in the world and I‚Äôm the only person that‚Äôs there for him the only person he can be vulnerable to.

I can‚Äôt handle this anymore and I feel like there‚Äôs a name for this, but I can‚Äôt figure out what it is. I don‚Äôt know how to google it every time I Google it it just send me the national domestic violence help line. It doesn‚Äôt feel right it doesn‚Äôt feel OK.

I told her I was with my boyfriend (25M) and that we definitely can, he just needed to drive because I struggle driving at night. On the way there, I knew that my bestie and her boyfriend (26-28 M not sure 100% on his age) had gotten into an argument at the bar and she just wanted to leave. I asked her if she wanted to go to her mom‚Äôs and she told me she wanted to get her car which was at his place. Once we picked her up, she was drunk and said she was going to stay with him. When we got towards his house he tried to call her and she didn‚Äôt answer because we were close anyways. I didn‚Äôt realize he had left her at the bar, I thought she just wanted to go home which immediately made me anxious. Before she left, she wanted to show my boyfriend and I something funny on her phone. Out of no where I look up, and her boyfriend got into his car and started driving it super fast head first at my car and essentially boxed us in where we were parked so we couldn‚Äôt just drive off and leave. He came incredibly close to hitting it with maybe an inch or two gap between our cars. My friend got out of the car to talk to him, my boyfriend locked the car doors, and then her boyfriend got out of his car and started screaming at everyone. Thank god my boyfriend had locked the car doors too because he tried to open them on my side then his and was pulling on the door handles and just saying a lot of rude stuff, which I can‚Äôt even fully remember because I was so anxious I almost threw up. My boyfriend put my car in reverse to try to maneuver around his car which he ended up moving after my friend told him she would bust his windshield open if he didn‚Äôt leave us alone. Apparently he thought that she was hanging out with another man because he had no clue that the man in the car was my boyfriend but he was acting irrational.

I messaged my friend today to let her know I‚Äôm here if she needs to talk, and that I love her to pieces, but that I can‚Äôt be caught in the cross fires. I feel like it put my safety at risk as well as my boyfriend‚Äôs. I was super nice over the text to emphasize I‚Äôm still there for her I just don‚Äôt want to get stuck in the middle of it again because it was terrifying.

Her boyfriend has a huge temper, a drinking problem, and has beat the crap out of her repeatedly. I feel bad telling her that I can‚Äôt really help her out in those situations but all I could think of last night was what if her boyfriend had a weapon, hurt me or my boyfriend, damaged my car, etc the list goes on and on.

This is so unbelievably hard and heartbreaking for me to write but the final straw happened this morning and I am scared.

I have been with my partner for 6 years..although he did abandon me during the pandemic while pregnant. He had a breakdown and i stupidly took him back..
We spend the last three years on the outside looking like we were living our best lives. Travelling with our daughter and making so called great memories when in reality i have been living life on a knifes edge.

He has always suffred with his mental helth and anger. I just spent so long focussing on the good and mking plans for iur future but i cannot take any more.

He gaslights me, shouts at me and my daughter, calls both of us names, puts me down, calls me useless, comes out with a number of threats. He has also been physical with me a few times. Grabbed my arm so hard it bruised for weeks, slaps round the head and today he kicked my hip and leg so hard it went dead. Any occasion..xmas, birthdays, he kicks off. 

He always blames me, there is always an excuse and is always everyone else never taking accountability form his actions.

This morning was just horrendous.
Last night my daughter 3 was unwell with a fever so i let her in the bed with me..he stayed on her bed. We all share a room. He woke up ranting at how pathetic i was and how bad his back was from no sleep on the bed. He went off at me and made me and my daugher cry all because she was in the bed unwell with me. I was turning the light on to look for some things and he came at me, through a chair across the room and kicked me in the leg calling me a fat C***t.

He has the nastiest toungue. He says vile things. My dad is mine and my daughters world and the abuser goes straight for the jugular saying the most horrific things he would do to my dad if i try to leave or take our daughter away. I cannot take it anymore. My heart breaks for the jekyll and hyde i live with..it is like two people but i cannot have my daughter growing up around this. 

I have started my own business online recently but not making any money as of yet. He pays for everything while i have been raising our child and running our lives. He likes to throw the fact that i have no money and in his words have amounted to nothing when in actual fact i have had enough in my life happen that would break most ( child abuse, 8 years sober, PTSD,Panic dissorder spouse abuse, family and business loss ) he used to be my praiser and now he is vile. He makes me miserable. 
I have been there when he was ready to unalive himself and yet my life and emotions mean nothing.

I don't know what to do. We are in the uk, I have no escape plan, no money, i am terrified. He is here 247 at the moment. My daughter is with me unwell and i just want to feel safe.

I do believe  that if we leave my dad is at a real risk. Other half has recently confessed to a few things to his past and what he has done and i believe him. He scares me. I feel so trapped and i want out. I cannot take anymore. I just want to be happy with my baby..he is dark and violent. Saying I will be feeding my dad through a straw if we leave.

She is a single mother, not working, on welfare. She's very troubled from past childhood trauma and everyone in my family knows she's unstable. She's very mean and spiteful to her children specifically my niece. The younger children are all boys and has a different relationship with my sister. My niece as a preteen is really struggling. She uses my niece as free child care, telling her she is not able to go to school because she needs to help her around the house. My niece and the other children are fearful of her and always afraid to get into trouble, so I know she is also physically violent toward them. My niece is almost 13 living on a matress on the floor, no tv, no access to music, no phone to contact relatives. I know electronics are not needed, but it feels as if it is more of punishment to not give her access to ""nice things"". My niece spent Christmas with us, but when we brought her home she cried because she so badly did not want to live in my sisters house. She was scared.  And I don't know what to do. Everyone knows it's a horrible situation and I'm really fearful for her. I have reported my sister to child services twice over the years. I  am in my 20s and live across the country and dont know if I can or should do anything else. Other members of my family know the problem and recognize it but only see it as a ""sad situation"" & ""nothing They can do"". They either don't have the time or resources to take on an 13 year old with development issues and deslexia. They also don't want to tell the law about a ""family matter"".  I want to report it, I want to help, but I am in school across the country and cannot take her at the moment or else I would. I don't want to report it and she have no where to go if removed. 

Any thoughts on if/who I should contact in this case? Speaking to my sister will not work, that has been tried and only causes her to be spiteful and retaliate against the kids for speaking up. I really want to help. I feel like I need to get her out of the situation before something truly bad happens. I don't think anyone in my family has the capacity for a legal battle.

I am not allowed to get my license, a job, my mother moved us to the middle of no where, I am not allowed a debit card, I do not have nor known my security card, I have to eat food, shower, and sleep at correct times (with exceptions of my mother being distracted), I haven't had a doctor check up in years, I do not get adequate dental care, I can't make friends, I'm not allowed to walk down or in the next aisle from my mother, I grew up with little to no friends, my life was a tiny bit less isolated for a very short period and I was with my partner and best friend. Then, my family isolated me from my partner. They made up a lie which was proven false. The truth was my mother didn't find him attractive or thought he had enough money, she wants me to date a man she finds attractive. They told me I could still talk to him and be his friend. I became very depressed, but never disrespected my family due to it. Then they forced an intervention and told me I will stop ""looking sad"" and ""being too quiet"" for over a year, I've been forced to smile and pretend to be happy even in my own room. Now, I saw my partner out in public. I was with a friend, my parents knew where I was. I was so happy, I hugged him and talked and held his hands as I spoke to him. My mothers older coworkers recorded me and sent it to her. She got me and threatened me in the car. She threatened to hurt him, told me I am dead to her, that I will never get my license, and I stayed respectful as I could. But it terrified me. I came home and cried in fear. My grandmother and grandfather threatened to physically hurt him as well to my face and I am terrified I am next. I have tried to get in contact with the 2 adults who haven't failed me, my counselors. My mother forced me out last night to a baseball game where her coworkers played, she got me alone and with a wicked smile told me horrible threats, that I have until this weekend to choice them or him, and then that if she wants to, she can shut off my phone. Problem there is I am already in close to total isolation and if they do that, I will be trapped fully. None of my friends, my counselors, anyone can contact me or me to them. I am so petrified, I can't sleep or eat. I do not know what to do, and honestly I'm praying they are bluffing to make me coward down and say ""yes I'll stay with you all forever and never leave."" They did it to my poor brother and he is 21, no license, no job, forced in online colleges, and he can't have his social security. I am desperate.

1ibya53,Do DV shelters/organizations actually help?,Content_Cat8466,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ibya53/do_dv_sheltersorganizations_actually_help/,"My therapist wants me to reach out to a DV shelter in the town we will be moving to in 6 months to start getting info so I can make a better plan to leave. My issues with leaving are I have 2 toddlers, haven't worked in over 5 years and can't even work in my degree field anymore, have no income or savings for myself so have no money for an apartment on my own, etc. He said the DV Shelter/Organization might have connections and info on lawyers who work with DV victims on sliding scale and specialize in child custody issues with DV (he's never hurt the kids, but we all know it's just a matter of time), and that they might be able to help me find a job and an apartment.

I feel like they probably won't be able to help in most of these areas. He said what harm does it do to call and ask. I know it doesn't hurt to ask but I guess I'm scared to find out they can't help me or they'll tell me that what I'm experiencing isnt that bad compared to others (and it's not, but hearing someone say that well would just kill my little bit of resolve to leave the relationship). It doesn't help that it's a military town and my husband is a high ranking officer. So the second someone finds that out about me I feel like the perception is ""You are an officer's wife, you have money and resources most couldn't dream of, you don't need our help"". I've experienced that a little at my current post, my advocate constantly makes assumptions about me and my safety plan and my life because I am an officer's wife, and I have a college degree and dress nicely. 

I've also refused to involve the police and it seems most places expect you to do that if you really want help. I've read reviews of the DV shelter/organization and it's very mixed. It very much sounds like if they deem you worthy to help they do everything they can to help you and if not you're SOL. I also don't know if they'll even talk to me at all since I don't live there yet. Surely I can't be the first person who wants to leave a DV situation after a planned move and wants info before arriving there?? But it seems like everything talks about you have to go to the shelter that fits your location. ",2025-01-28 10:03:19,2025-03-17 03:10:52,help

The psychological abuse alone has forced me to move back home and leave my job. But the last few times I saw him he tried ‚Äúplay‚Äù slapping me during an argument and asked me to do it back to him. He also for the last few months kept saying he was a great man to me because he would never hit me. And he‚Äôs ‚Äúnever raised his voice to me‚Äù except one time he yelled at me to shut up because I talk to much when he asked me what I wanted to eat for dinner and I said ‚Äúummm‚Äù. 

Otherwise, he was possessive, jealous, cheating, and critical of me to an almost comical level. I‚Äôve had to do massive amounts of work to even begin to repair myself. He has been left by all his exes and has (kind of) admitted to being an asshole. He has two friends that I know of but ‚Äúbeef‚Äù with many people including his neighbors.

I stopped counseling in August when i felt my dv counselor was becoming a shell of a person and I was just talking the whole time without much feedback or support. Now I am left to deal with everything on my own and I often feel I am super close to reaching a breaking point. A person can only handle so much.

I was catfished by an ex 7 years ago when he pretended to be a female on Instagram in order to attempt to ship me back to him when he realized I found someone new and was moving on. I told ""her"" no thank you and that I am not interested in him anymore. He was also the one to break up with me so none of it makes sense to me logically, then again I don't think this guy functions based on logic - stalkers usually don't. the icing on the cake was that the pics he used to catfish me were of a girl he cheated on me with when we were together for all of 9 months (short relationship). I was na√Øve at that time and didn't think it was a catfish account until months later when ""she"" realized I wasn't going to go running back to my ex. at this point, she began telling me she is bi-sexual and found me attractive (a desperate attempt to feel connected to me or maybe sabotage my new relationship maybe? I will never know why he did that i guess)..she also told me she sells nudes to rich men on the internet and they send her money and she can help me get into this type of work if Im ever interested. At this point I knew this has to be a man being creepy and a catfish..but i was in too much denial to accept that my ex would do such a thing (even tho this catfish had his phone #) so i allowed myself to believe it was the actual girl (after all I texted my ex to tell him the girl was requesting to be instagram friends and he told me to add her if i want and warned me she is crazy)..I wanted to believe he has good morals and would not be the face behind the account..

he was... things escalated quite a bit. I attempted on several occassions over the last few years to make police reports and left the station in tears because I never received help. my partner called me crazy two years ago when i told him my ex sent me a photo of a knife. he said I was crazy and nobody wants to ""fucking"" hurt me. ofc i took that to police and they bluntly told me i could go to the magistrate office to get a warrant for his arrest but he will likely be released in a day and go to court later on so he would be free and will be more angry and likely try to hurt me..i also mentioned to my sisters and parents and they all treated it like some type of joke and never brought it up again..my sisters even said im overthinking and its some spam from insgtagram..but he created numerous new phone #s each time i blocked a # and followed me on tiktok making accounts pretending to be me, messaged my friends and family asking for photos of me. he even showed up outside of my home and that wasnt enough to get a police report..An irresponsible counselor suggested i try to meet my ex in a public setting to confront him. i met with him for food. he offered me food and i did not accept anything from him. i was too scared to confront him so i confronted him in texts after some time of gathering evidence and he freaked out. he has mentally abused me so much that Im now stuck in a situationship that is aggressive and sexual.

I (33F) was in a three-year relationship with a man (34M) who joined the Navy during our time together, turning our relationship bicoastal (CA--> FL). We broke up in April after I discovered he had been sending nude photos to women online and lying about his whereabouts, including going to strip clubs. Over his year-long Navy stint, he became deeply depressed, struggling with isolation from his friends, community, and me. Shortly after I ended things, he left the Navy on grounds that he was experiencing severe depression. 

Despite the breakup, it was hard knowing he was back home and so close. I missed him terribly, and eventually, I reached out. I wanted to talk in person, to make sense of everything. He had been deeply affected by his time in the Navy, and I tried to approach him with compassion, understanding that depression can drive people to act out in destructive ways. As we spent more time together, I began to forgive him for his lies and the betrayal. Over time, we grew closer, and, strangely, our relationship felt stronger than ever. He opened up more, communicated his feelings, and no longer lashed out when I expressed mine‚Äîa stark contrast to his behavior during his time in the Navy, when he‚Äôd hang up on me or dismiss my emotions entirely (once called my feelings stupid altogether). 

I know this paints an ugly picture of him, but I saw so much good in him. As someone who loves him and is loved by him, I know his heart and anyone can tell you that he is the most beautiful person. I just happen to know the dark, not so pretty sides of him too. He had a difficult upbringing, witnessing domestic abuse and being told to suppress his emotions. I wanted to believe his heart was kind, that he didn‚Äôt mean to hurt me. And truthfully, he did make real efforts to change. He's gotten really good at expressing his feelings lately. He is making a conscious effort and it has made me feel like he values this relationship. It's interesting because he's actually gotten better, and I've seen myself subside and become avoidant emotionally (because of all the yelling, I suppose). 

**Physical Violence:** 

Anyway, things came to a head on his birthday 1 month ago, which we spent together. He told me he wanted to spend the day with someone who mattered and that he was ready to make changes in his life. But our relationship had always been entwined with alcohol‚Äîhe‚Äôs a bartender and a heavy drinker, and I've always found myself mirroring those habits when we were together. That night, we got VERY drunk. My memory of the evening is patchy, but I remember arguing about money spent on weed. The next thing I knew, I had punched him in the face. Then I blacked out again.

When I came to again, he had my hair in his hands and slammed me to the floor. He stomped on my chest and choked me. I begged him to stop, but he didn‚Äôt. His face was blank, and I felt helpless. I got up and ran out of my apartment to call my cousin and recounted everything immediately in a haze of disbelief. My roommates, who had heard the commotion, made him leave the apartment, but I still felt compelled to let him sleep in my car since he lives two hours away and it was late (he had taken the train to come see me). Back inside my apt, I remember repeating ""he wouldn't do this to me... "" over and over but my roommates said that he did, that they heard it, and my cousin told me that she's glad I called her immediately because the memory was fresh and I honestly probably would have blocked it out. I was and still am in a complete state of denial. The only thing keeping me grounded in reality was the pain on my neck telling me it did happen. Even then, I couldn‚Äôt fully process what had happened. I kept telling myself, *This isn‚Äôt him. This is the alcohol.*

Later that night, when my roommates went back to sleep, I went out to check on him because he'd been blowing up my phone. He was angry and confused, yelling at me and started saying really mean things and calling me unlovable‚Äîwords that cut deeply because he‚Äôd never said anything like that before. He threatened to damage my car and demanded I drive him home. I told him I couldn't drive because I was drunk, but he pulled my hair again. With his hands in my hair this second time I knew it was undeniably real ‚ÄîI was much more sober by then and couldn‚Äôt believe it was happening, even after what he had already done. Eventually, I drove him to the train station around 2 am, once I felt sober enough. I didn‚Äôt feel safe with him nearby, and he wouldn‚Äôt let me back into my house without risking a scene in the middle of the night.

The next morning, he called to tell me he had made it home. He said he was done drinking and told me I needed to stay away from him. He admitted that no matter what I did, I (5'2"", 113 lbs) didn‚Äôt deserve to be thrown to the ground and choked by someone his size (6', \~200? lbs). He said his job was to protect me, but instead, he hurt me, and we couldn‚Äôt be together. I agreed.

In the weeks that have followed, he's sent occasional texts like ""I love you,"" ""I hope you're having a good day,"" and messages about missing me. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm struggling with flashbacks, panic attacks, and difficulty getting out of bed. I had to uncomfortably inform my workplace that I‚Äôd been ""assaulted"" without providing further details and continue pretending everything was normal.

I do not want to tell anyone. Especially not my family, even though it is extremely difficult to hide my pain from them. The only people who know are my therapist, cousin, roommates, and one close friend. I think part of me still holds on to some kind of hope that we'll turn out okay and be happy together, as irrational and delusional as that may seem.

I can't help but feel responsible for getting physical with him. I also hate living with the fact that I'll never truly know what started the fight- did he pull my hair first? Why the f\*ck would I punch him? I have to live with the fact that I did that to him too (although he claims vehemently that I did nothing wrong and if anything had years of pent up anger for how he's treated me... it's absolutely not acceptable. I fully acknowledge my role in this situation and I hate that it happened and that that I'll never know how it started).

**Flash Forward:** 

After 3 weeks of no contact, I‚Äôve seen him twice. It started with a hotel hookup‚Äîa moment of weakness where I sought closure and comfort. I was shaking and scared that he'd hurt me again (I've heard the stories about people who do it once and then find it easier to do again and again) but it felt necessary. I'd started to wonder about who this person I spent so much time loving really was and felt that seeing him again might help. Talking face-to-face about what happened helped in some ways, but it also reignited feelings I wasn‚Äôt ready to confront. The second time we met, I slipped into denial, pretending everything was fine and that we were back together. I‚Äôve since realized I was clinging to that delusion because it was easier than facing the immense pain of the pain he's caused me over the years, flashbacks of that night a month ago, and the ultimate loss of someone who I love very much. 

A few days ago, he reminded me that we cannot be together until we‚Äôve both taken time apart to heal. He said I'm enabling him and that he needs/deserves to feel the pain of losing me if he's ever going to change, otherwise me running back to him makes it feel like nothing happened. Hearing it from him shattered my fragile denial, and now I‚Äôm back at square one, feeling broken and overwhelmed. I know I need to heal, but the path forward feels daunting. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve turned to this community‚Äîfor advice, support, and a reminder that I‚Äôm not alone in trying to navigate this pain. Anything helps.",2024-11-30 21:36:48,2025-03-17 03:10:58,help

I apologize but I am going to give some context before I get to the issue.  I have been separated from my abuser for two years now. We have split custody of our daughter. I have spent this time in therapy working through all the brain washing I endured during my marriage and come to accept the abuse that occurred. My therapist specializes in cases like these. She also has worked closely with children in these cases. At one point I brought up concerns that my ex is SA our daughter. My therapist walked me through everything, from what questions to ask her and how to go about calling cops and cps. But they closed the case. I was painted as the crazy ex wife who is going nuclear and framing a good man. I sought out legal help and the lawyer said if I continue to press this matter I will lose my daughter. I have spent the past year sitting with the guilt of having my hands tied and not being able to help my daughter without the risk of losing her. I have been too afraid to talk to anyone about it in therapy because I know she will have to file a report and again risk losing my baby. I have been shown no one will believe me. My own family didn't believe me when I came to tell them about how he abused me. Okay now onto the issue at hand. Tonight before bed my daughter picked out one of the many books I bought that teach about SA awareness and safety in a kid appropriate way. This is the first time she picked this book out since a year ago when we went through the whole investigation. As I read her the book I am checking in with her, asking questions to make sure she understands what is going on in the story like I always do. This book in particular even gives prompt questions to ask. The answer she gave are very concerning to say the absolute least. I don't know what to do.

In the past we were together but he was violent just doing things like strangling me, not letting me get away at all as would lock me up, trying to make me drink bleach and various other things. I managed to leave the relationship which took a huge amount of strength but when I left I began using my DOC Heroin significantly more. I experienced some things during the course of our relationship which meant I became very dependant on him to the point I couldn‚Äôt go outside or use the toilet without him there. Anyway although I managed to leave us living together I still can‚Äôt break away from him 100%. I see him weekly and it‚Äôs messing me up so much as I‚Äôm now clean from drugs and alcohol but I‚Äôm worried his involvement will lead me to relapse.

If he stopped speaking to me I‚Äôd relapse. This is how fragile I am after being clean for nearly a year but it‚Äôs only towards him. I have no one around me at all.

so u can skip info because im so desperate for advice. The main question/point is last paragraph but I feel the context is imprtant

-His personality 

I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs the possessive, super insecure, overly in love to the point it‚Äôs toxic, with a really bad n terrible temper that affects everyone and thing in his life. 
so not necessarily a narc, who would directly neg, intentionally hide things or be horrible. but definitely self entitled. 
when something doesn‚Äôt go how he wants or expected, that‚Äôs when shit hits the fan.

-Emotional abuse 

In our relationship the abuse usually stems from his false perceptions or taking what I say personally. Which leads to minimisation, gaslighting, deflection, denying, going around in circles for hours until he is tired and admits fault. this is an exhausting cycle. 

-Physical abuse 

during arguments he had done things like put his hand over my mouth to shut me up, grab me by the neck, or like grab my thigh. Which wasn‚Äôt a lot compared to how much we argued but still. These were big things to me though, I spent countless conversations trying to aid our relationship and stop it, because it did hurt me a lot despite it not being extreme. 

-First proper physical incident (nov 2023) 

There was a major incident of abuse when I was pregnant (both intent to get abortion ), he grabbed me by the throat and kept restraining me on the bed not allowing me to leave, for a moment he had put a pillow over my face to smother me for 2 secs then punched my face over it not too hard but sorta, pulled my hair and told me to kill myself. threw my phone out the window. 

-Second incident (September 2024) 

Second incident was much worse and my memory isn‚Äôt great since we were drunk. 
we were so far from home on holiday, he locked me in a small toilet and wouldn‚Äôt let me leave after a good while. He took my phone and iPad away.  he choked me a couple times and restrained me on the bed. he sort of thrown me on the floor or something then he used his phone to film me for a couple seconds crying. I escaped through a window and got the hotel guy to get him to give me my stuff. At this point he was playing victim to the tens and was slitting his wrists in the shower saying he was gonna kill himself.

This happened the start of September yet it feels so long ago. I broke up with him after and I said we weren‚Äôt getting back but as time went on and he started an abusers programme, I evidently couldn‚Äôt cope without him.

-Am I an abuser? // third incident 

Since then, I‚Äôve been a totally different person, I was never even verbally abusive- that was out the picture for me , but now the slightest thing can trigger me and I‚Äôll start hurling insults, ones that he‚Äôd never even go as far as to call me. This doesn‚Äôt happen too often, but it‚Äôs been enough times. whenever he shuts down in an argument, or if I have a problem I wanna talk about n he ignores me, it‚Äôs like my whole body goes into over drive and I‚Äôll get physical. I genuinely feel like I am going so insane I need to be locked up. I‚Äôll tug on him hard to talk to me, basically wrestle him on the bed. Give him pussy slaps and hits to pester him to talk and just cry and beg. I want him to hit me, idk why, but the 2 incidents were the worst things to ever happen to me why would I want that? ITry to self harm infront of him, not even just for attention but just because it genuinely feels like it‚Äôs the end of the world to me . I know this is badly abusive, because I expressed this to my friends when he‚Äôd do it to me (he‚Äôd threaten it a lot, would try to take pills during arguments or go to stab himself). 

First time it happened it scared me and I swore I wouldnt again but I did. 
Same thing but i kept escalating it. I kept badly poking and prodding. We were fighting upright but in the terms of hes trying to get me off. he was lying about something that badly hurt me and was basically laughing about it- which triggered me so much so I poured soggy cereal on his head. In return I literally got wwe slammed onto the bed, restrained, choked, and my hair badly pulled, and then a proper slap across the face. might‚Äôve been more but my memory is horrible with these events. 
He left the room and blood boiled in me, if he can treat me like that why doesn‚Äôt he get the same in return? So I went out the room and swung, I meant to slap him but it was more a crab claw to the face. his nose started gushing. He spat the blood on me. 
This was probably a week ago, and objectively the worst that‚Äôs happened between us. I am obviously upset about it but I‚Äôm numb to it, I forget it happened considering how fresh it was. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm allowed to be upset about it because i kept pushing and pushing. I got what I wanted I guess.

Now im possessive, jealous, angry all the time and i know when it isn‚Äôt realistically right to feel this way yet i cant help have all of these negative emotions. Why do i want him to hit me when we argue? It‚Äôs not in a way of I‚Äôm trying to get him to do it so I have an excuse to leave, because I use to do that and i can differentiate the 2 feelings.
When I want him to do it it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm craving connection, or even just attention, idk it feels good during those moments. But why? 
I feel like I‚Äôve lost myself, I‚Äôm unrecognisable .",2025-01-13 19:33:49,2025-03-17 03:11:06,help

A part of me feels relieved, confused, and guilty. All I ever wanted from him was the truth and to treat me right.  Whenever I would call him out on his obvious lies, he would get upset and angry. 

At this point, I feel so alone but hopeful for the future. I think about the woman I was before I married him. I was the person I always wanted to be and the person who I thought would never be in this situation. Today I feel like I don‚Äôt know the person I‚Äôve become over the last 2 plus years. We go to church but I don‚Äôt feel as if God really honored our marriage. So many lies from the beginning that I did not discover until later. 


When he hit me and threatened my life three weeks ago, I was more concerned about him killing himself than what he did to me. Over the last few hours all I can think about is how my decision at this moment is so crucial. If I stay, it will only get worse because now he may be motivated to kill me.  

I‚Äôm confused by why the cops did not arrest him the night he hit me. I knew there was a warrant but why did they not arrest him before when they knew of his whereabouts? I just felt like that night I was so ready to be done and move on. I was so ready to start my new life until I came home to him the next day after I thought the locks were changed but not. I called the police then and they did nothing.  

Over the last three weeks, I thought about him hurting me in my sleep. Wanting to work it out but still that fear of the unknown. Spill trying to process everything. ",2024-05-04 02:31:53,2025-03-17 03:14:28,domestic violence

In light of this, how much do you disclose about past relationships where DV was a factor? And is there a way you specifically explain it? The level of abuse my ex did to me is so nuts that I honestly feel like I sound like I'm the one who is crazy just trying to explain it. The vibe was that the new guy asked why I got involved and assumed was that I must also be ""crazy"" if I ""allowed"" this to happen to me...and immediately friend-zoned me where we had been starting an intimate relationship.

Fast forward, I spent 15 years casually dating but basically remained single, healed through therapy and thought I was emotionally healthy etc.  I have now married a man who is beautiful inside and out.  Protective and wouldn't harm a hair on me or the kids.  We have experienced differences of opinions but it's always been respectful, calm, never shouting or physical. 

Last night we fell out, bound to happen we have a lot of kids and we disagreed on one of them.  Just talking and we were both getting frustrated with one another, so I got up and went to leave the room.  He asked where I was going and I said downstairs, that I didn't want to continue the conversation I was getting upset.  He jumped up to give me a cuddle and I freaked out. 

I asked him not to touch me and he went to cuddle me again and at that point he said what's wrong, I'm not going to hurt you, and he backed off.  He looked upset (retrospectivly I can see this face) and I moved into the corner of the room.  He came toward me and tried to hold me in a cuddle and I flipped, I held my arms up and started to panic, I started to cry and tbh didn't really see him, although it was him there, I pushed him away and really was in a state kept saying get away, don't touch me.   I then said get away from me again crying and panicked and he got to his knees to show me he didn't mean to be a threat, he stayed still until I calmed down and stopped breathing heavy and panicking.   

When I sat on the bed, he talked to me but was so hurt.  He said he could see my distress and just wanted to hold me safe and let me know I was safe.   I always tell him his arms are the safest place I've ever been.  He really is upset, saying he can't get the look on my face as I looked through him out of his head.  

We talked, I have no idea why this happened.  Never happened in 15 years and why with him, I know he wouldn't hurt me and I've explained I know this and trust him.  

Any ideas or advice please? How do I stop this happening again, how do I understand and how can I help him understand it wasn't his fault?",2023-07-05 11:44:15,2025-03-17 03:14:34,domestic violence

It‚Äôs been really beautiful finding a community of people who are all going through similar situations as I am. Here‚Äôs my story: 

I lived with my mom and my stepdad, and I have three siblings who still currently live there. My stepdad has always been emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive, and my mom has done nothing to help. He specifically targeted me because I‚Äôm transgender and very outspoken about when sh*t isn‚Äôt right. 

I had been dealing with the abuse since I was 12 years old, and I‚Äôll be 22 next month. I left the house around November, 2023 because my stepdad took it too far. He picked me up and threw me across the kitchen- basically almost k*lling me. He did this because I touched my little brother‚Äôs face to look at his loose tooth. It was so uncalled for. 

A few weeks later I packed up all my sh*t, put my stuff in storage- and I‚Äôve been living out of my coupe. I‚Äôve been trying to get government assistance but that hasn‚Äôt been working out at all. I have so many bills piling up from behind unable to keep up with payments. I‚Äôve been doing Uber Eats and I work part time at a museum- but all of my money has gone to keeping up with my car. 

Any advice would be amazing on any steps I can take to get out of this situation. I feel like I‚Äôve tried everything.

Apologies if any language is coarse, it was originally written for* r/UnethicalLifeProTips *specifically because she wants to work outside the system, and was written for that audience, but I've done my best to go back and edit to be more sensitive to current setting.*

**Note: I am not soliciting donations and will not accept direct financial aid if offered. I respect the generosity of individuals, but my friend's needs are systemic and are unlikely to be significantly helped by direct aid, however well intentioned.**

Redditors, I come to you today with a simple request: Help my friend escape her abusive home situation without reporting her abuser.

Context: I have a very dear friend, 38F, who for the sake of this post we'll call Jenny. Jenny has had an extremely difficult life. Her biological family was various shades of neglectful and abusing, and at age 10 when she did what she was supposed to do (reach out to the adults responsible for her and ask for help) due to SA at home, she was removed from the home and placed in the foster care system where the abuse only worsened. All of this to give context that

* Jenny is deeply untrusting of CPS and authorities in general
* Jenny has been conditioned to believe that the terrible things done to her are her fault, and that talking makes it worse
* Jenny has for much of her life attracted abusers who sense her vulnerability and prey on it.

Now, at 38, Jenny is a mother of 2 small children and is entirely dependent upon their abusive father. This man (we'll call him Dave) has abused her financially, emotionally, mentally, physically and sexually for the majority of their relationship. Jenny has finally reached her breaking point and has ended her relationship with this man, but as we all know, physically leaving an abusive asshole is another kettle of fish entirely. The abuse has ramped up since she stood up to him, and I have absolutely no doubts that if she's still in Dave's house in 3 months, she'll soon be in the ground, either because he put there or because he drove her to do it herself.

Jenny has no education and no financial resources. She has work experience and has worked entry level jobs (mostly fast food) but is currently unemployed. She has no safety net to speak of. She desperately wants to escape, but is utterly unwilling to report Dave, for the dual reason that she is reliant on his income to care for her children (he can't go to jail, he has to go to work) and that she has a massive, trauma fueled fear that CPS will take her babies away and they'll live through the same horrors that she experienced. *Note: I understand that most DV orgs will not report to police without the willing consent of the victim. This not a rational fear. That said, it's her VERY real fear, reinforced through trauma, and I'm attempting to be a safe person for someone who has known very few safe people in her life. I will not violate her boundaries, or pressure her to do so, when she's only learning how to enforce them, even if they're illogical.*

Our current plan is to have her, during her next WIC visit, speak to their access person and claim that her boyfriend no longer wants to be with her and is kicking her out in order to try and secure a fast track to emergency government housing, but I simply worry this won't be enough with her unwilling to discuss her abuse. After all, there's a ton of competition for these resources.

Redditors, I need help. I work in healthcare. All of my relevant knowledge revolves on leaning into the system to take advantage of the systems built to help victims. I have no idea how to even begin to navigate this without addressing the underlying abuse, but Jenny deserves basic human dignity, and I have to try. Please help me help this wonderful woman escape an abusive home. Any method of attaining short term housing, building resources that can't be taken away, and just starting to build a life for herself are welcome. All ideas will be considered. Jenny is located in central Indiana .Life has shit on this beautiful soul every moment of her life, please help me lift her up to attain basic human dignity. Also, if anyone who DOES work in the DV/CPS/LE systems has any insight into what she CAN talk about with ZERO fear of a criminal case being opened, or more importantly for her peace of mind, a CPS investigation, that would be huge insight as well. Thank you so much for your time and your help everyone.",2024-06-11 18:05:15,2025-03-17 03:14:47,domestic violence

He went with his mother and girlfriend but his whole family thinks he is the victim and im just trying to put him in jail he is a very good manipulator and narcissist. I highly doubt they know all the things he has done and said to me so i am  very surprised he brought them to his court date. So my question is would they have found out everything at the court date or is it more so just like here is your charges and this is your sentence.  I would have loved for everything to be thrown out there so they know the true person he is and the girlfriend would run!  I also hope the judge ripped into him and said how horrendous his behavior is. His charge ending up being contempt of court order and all the other harassment charges dropped in exchange of his plea.,2024-06-06 16:19:02,2025-03-17 03:14:48,domestic violence

There are two parents, a stay at home mom and a dad who works outside of the home. We can hear the mom screaming at the kids, slamming doors, and hitting walls. We do not know if she does it when the dad is at home. We do not think she hits the kids-- they have no signs of injury. There are periods where we don't hear anything, including ones where the mom is away. When that happens, we can often hear the dad playing with the kids, but no yelling. The yelling is often punctuated with stomping and cursing. It has been going on more than a year: it will stop for a few weeks or even a month or two, and then start up again.

We've asked friends what to do, and considered telling our landlord (who is a pretty decent guy and father), calling child protective services and calling the police. We've tried to keep a record of what we hear. Our friends have mixed opinions but most feel like getting child services or the cops involve would be worse for the kids. We've also considered contacting the dad and offering our help, either with babysitting or keeping an ear out or something. I really want to do what's best for the kids and I feel guilty every day we don't do anything.

I just joined this DV community a few days ago and have been reading post after post of violence and desperation‚Äîpeople wanting to leave but afraid to. It saddens me that the people we loved unconditionally and trusted would betray us. It‚Äôs just so heartbreaking, and I wish I could help everyone who‚Äôs going through it. I want to share my story, hoping it might give someone the courage to leave.

I met him in 2002‚Äîtall, dark, and handsome. We met at a weekly hotel, the only place I could afford at that time while working full-time at a restaurant. We moved in together quickly to save money. There were no red flags; he was hardworking, sweet, and caring. We worked together to save money and get out of the hotel, which was filled with drugs and frequent overdoses.

One day, he told me to get dressed because we were going somewhere, but he wouldn‚Äôt tell me where. He said he would take me to the moon. He surprised me by getting us an apartment, and we moved in right away. Everything was going well, and I was happy until, a few weeks later, he woke me up in the middle of the night, saying he had a dream that I was cheating on him. I was shocked, and he started hitting me and pulling my hair. I escaped that morning, but without a car, I could only walk down the street. He caught up to me, and a police car passed us. He begged me to calm down and said he was sorry, so I went back with him. I was in shock and didn‚Äôt know what to do, and I had nowhere else to go.

Months passed, and the emotional and mental abuse started. He would call me names, and I had to tiptoe around him, making sure not to trigger his anger. I always had to be cheerful, and it was exhausting. There was a time when he got so mad that he took me for a ride on the 101 freeway, punching me in the face while driving. I almost passed out, and he said he would dump me in an alley. I tried to escape many times. I would go to my mom‚Äôs house, but during that time, my mother was battling breast cancer, so I didn‚Äôt want to burden her with my problems. He would show up at my mom‚Äôs house and text me, threatening to cause problems if I didn‚Äôt come out. So I would just go with him.

The night he found my diary: I had written that I knew he was cheating on me and that I wished he would just leave me alone and go with her. When I came home from work that night, he was waiting for me. He tried to choke me, lifting me up with one hand. I felt my throat closing, and I passed out. When I woke up, he was laughing in my face, and his eyes looked different, almost possessed‚Äîlike he wasn‚Äôt the same man I fell in love with. When I got up, he kept screaming, slapping me, and punching my stomach until I started bleeding. He dropped me off at the hospital and left. I had a miscarriage.

The cops got involved, and at first, I got a restraining order and went to court. I thought I was free of him and that he would go to jail. But the lawyer told me he was only getting three months, and a social worker commented that animals have better protection than women. I left court that day thinking I had three months to get my things out of the house and find a new place. But the next day, he just walked right into the apartment. They let him out early without even warning me. He came into the house and told me he might as well kill me, saying I would never get rid of him. I felt so helpless and hopeless that I asked him to just end it. I was so tired. I gave up. I did what he told me to do and kept quiet, taking the abuse for 10 years. I was ashamed to ask for help because I didn‚Äôt want anyone to pity me.

Even during my mother‚Äôs funeral, he was furious at me for not making him breakfast because I had to handle funeral arrangements early in the morning. During the drive to the cemetery, he was screaming in my face about his missed breakfast. I was numb. I felt my mother telling me I could leave him now. I had been worried that if I left him while she was alive, he would cause problems for her, but now that she was gone, I didn‚Äôt have to worry about that anymore. I wanted to leave but had no savings and nowhere to go, so I stayed.

In 2012, he suddenly wanted to go to Alaska. I didn‚Äôt want to go, but I did‚ÄîI don‚Äôt even know why. I was just tired of fighting. I had a bad feeling, but I still went. The first two weeks in Alaska were the worst. I was now isolated from everything familiar and didn‚Äôt know anyone. One night, he woke me up in the middle of the night and asked if I loved him. That was the moment I truly realized I didn‚Äôt, but I told him yes. He then proceeded to punch me and drag me by my hair, threatening to kill me and then himself. It was so exhausting; I just wanted it to end.

Around 7 am that morning, he left to get beer, I think‚ÄîI don‚Äôt remember anymore. I called 911 and asked them to help me get out. While waiting for the cops, I tried to pack my belongings, but I couldn‚Äôt find my phone, and he had taken my debit card and cash. He left me with some coins and about $4‚ÄîI‚Äôll never forget that. When the cops arrived, I asked them to get my phone and card from him, but he claimed he didn‚Äôt have them. At that point, he was fuming, but I didn‚Äôt care‚ÄîI just left with the cops. They didn‚Äôt arrest him. The cops asked where they could drop me off, and I said the Anchorage airport, but they said it was 45 minutes away and instead dropped me off at a bus stop in front of a gas station about three blocks from the cabin.

As I sat at the bus stop, trying to figure out how to get to the airport and not even knowing which bus to take or when it was coming, a man with long white hair and a beard‚Äîlike Santa Claus‚Äîapproached me. He said he didn‚Äôt mean to pry but saw me get out of the police car and asked if I needed help. My mind was racing. I thought, if I go with this man, he could be a serial killer, but if I stay here, my ex might find me and kill me. I decided to go with him. I told him I needed help getting to the airport, and he said okay, but we‚Äôd have to pick up his wife at the post office on the way. I was relieved to hear that, so we got into his red truck. I may have laughed to myself a little when I saw the red truck thinking this guy is santa clause and I definitely felt safe with this man, even though I didn‚Äôt know his name. As we drove to pick up his wife, I told him what had happened. When we got to the post office, he parked far from the front door, probably to explain why I was in the truck. His wife saw me, started crying, and almost ran toward me. She opened the car door and gave me the warmest hug, and I started crying hysterically. They offered me a place to stay while I figured out my next steps, but I told them the ride was the best help they could give me. She didn‚Äôt have any money, but she gave me half a pack of cigarettes because I smoke, and a bottle of water before they dropped me off at the airport.

At the airport, I only had $4 and some coins. I called my cousin, who works for an airline, and he hooked me up with a buddy pass, which is a standby ticket, so I could only get on if there was an available seat. The only flight from Alaska to the mainland was at 1 AM, so I had to wait. I had to keep a low profile and spent time walking around the airport looking for a hidden spot. When 1 AM came, there was no seat for me, and I had to wait another day. It was my birthday. I was so hungry, so I used $2 to get a burger from the dollar menu. I ate half and saved the other half for later. I even used the other $2 to get coffee for my birthday. 1 AM came again, and still no seat for me. At this point, I started to have doubts. I was hungry, exhausted, and had no sleep for two nights. The airport floor was cold. I had to be strong. The next morning, the news reported a huge storm coming through Anchorage. The flight status board showed cancellations and delays, and the airport was chaotic. Around midnight, I watched through the windows as rain went sideways and strong winds shook the planes. I was freaking out because I already hate flying, and now there was a storm. I thought, no way am I flying in that. I figured the flight would be canceled anyway, as many others had been. But then they called my name! I hesitated, thinking, why?! I stood there for a minute, deciding what to do. Then I thought, screw it‚ÄîI‚Äôd rather die on that plane than be killed by my ex. I handed the lady my ticket and got on the plane. It was half-empty, which made me even more nervous, but I had three seats all to myself. I closed the window shade and mentally prepared myself, accepting that if this was my last day on earth, so be it. The plane took off through the storm, shaking violently for about five minutes, and then it calmed. I opened the shades and saw the gray storm clouds below the plane and stars in the dark blue sky above. I felt free‚ÄîI could breathe again. I started crying, and then my exhaustion took over, and I slept like a baby until we landed.

I made it to Virginia eventually. I didn‚Äôt have time to mope around; I went to work right away. I hated staying with family and depending on others, so I worked hard and saved every penny. Yes, many nights I felt lonely, and a part of me wanted the old him back, but I had to remind myself that he would kill me. I kept myself busy with work and eventually got my own place. I met new people who saw my potential and hard work, and now, I have my own space. It‚Äôs been 12 years now. Yes, I am still healing. I didn‚Äôt have time to go through a healing process because I was busy trying to survive. I don‚Äôt have much, but it‚Äôs mine. I wanted to share my story to give others hope. Yes, it is hard. It‚Äôs very lonely, physically, emotionally, and mentally. I have my cousin, but I don‚Äôt really share my problems with them. Even today, they don‚Äôt know the extent of what I went through. I don‚Äôt know why; maybe because I am ashamed that I let that man treat me like that‚Äîsomeone I used to love and trust. It‚Äôs hard to trust someone now, which is why I stay single. I also want to heal first before I can truly love another man.",2024-09-09 01:24:50,2025-03-17 03:15:04,survivor

And it was great at first - but then she suffered a back injury and fell into a deep depression. 
She said her back hurt too much to think of that- which makes sense. But she also has a history of SA, and most of her partners never really cared about what she wanted or asked for consent. 

Her back got better but the libido never returned. She is a lot more strict now on where I can touch her and asks me to initiate but when I do she rejects me every time. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because now she feels safe enough to say no, but I want to understand her better. I try and talk with her but sometimes it seems like she doesn‚Äôt even know what does and doesn‚Äôt trigger her. I‚Äôve tried suggesting mutually masturbating, or using toys, or even just making out so that there is some sort of intimacy. They work at first and then she withdraws again.

1gzq4ec,Advice on Resources for Male DV Survivors [SC],ArchimedesIncarnate,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1gzq4ec/advice_on_resources_for_male_dv_survivors_sc/,"Hello,

Some quick background: My now ex was physically, financially, and emotionally abusive, and I took too long getting out because of family and religious pressures. Jehovah's Witnesses do not consider DV, especially against men, to be a valid reason for divorce. Hypocritically, they supported her when I got the kids to a therapist through the local DV support group and she was referred to CPS. I was attacked for ""giving the church a bad name"". Public writings try and paint a different picture, but the reality is DV survivors in the church, male or female, are always viewed as the problem for saying something.

Anyway, long story short, my career got derailed because of PTSD. Part of my key responsibility was leading emergency response to chemical spills, and I developed a tendency to freeze when it got intense. The actual situation I can handle, but the key moment was when a guy didn't like my orders shoved me into a corner. (He was trying to blow a toxic vapor cloud into a neighborhood. The correct response was to suppress it with sprinklers and continuously suck up the water with a waste vacuum truck.) I froze, and snapped out of it in time, but if I hadn't it could have been bad.

Two days later I had a panic attack so bad I ended up in inpatient mental health treatment for a month. That was fun. It turns out the trope that there's always a guy that thinks he's Jesus is based in reality.

I've been doing contract work and consulting for a few years now, interspersed with substitute teaching and restaurant work. I'm struggling to maintain mental health treatment, and I'm just so damn alone. The support groups I've found for men have been toxic, incel type attitudes. I have trouble letting down my guard with women. Or men for that matter. Having been raised in the JW cult, I had no support outside it. I've reconnected with my brother who left when I was 9, but that's it. Even my parents are ""Well, she's still going to the church"".

I want a real life again, and that means not just getting by. I've got to reengage with life and my career. Career will come first since that's the root of my confidence. I'm going back to school to get my MBA, and am back going to trivia nights when I can afford it, even if I play alone (Team name is Square Root of -1 Friends, written with the radical sign, because I'm a nerd.)

I want to quit half-assing work and sub-contracting, and go all in, and for that I need to fundraise for a business. I also need to figure out how to get mental health help. Everything I've found so far is for women.

I've heard there are grants available, but bureaucracy has always been my weakness, and for some reason it triggers anxiety. So do sales calls. Probably because of the fear of rejection. That couldn't possibly be caused by getting abandoned by everyone I've known for decades.

I'm good at what I do. I do safety for chemical plants. Risk assessments, mitigation, training. I'd saved up enough working two jobs to get started and Helene wiped me out, while also hurting the clients I had lined up, so they cancelled. I'm trying the Small Business Administration but it's a nightmare to navigate, and they're out of funding anyway.

Note: I am NOT fundraising here. Not only did I read rule #5, I wouldn't have done that here anyway. I'm trying to find out if there are programs and resources available, and how to get to them.

So....

Question 1: Is there help available to navigate getting health care? I freeze dealing with DSS, as they feel brusque and hostile. Intellectually I know they're probably just busy, but emotionally it feels personally hostile. Or it could be that the second caseworker for the DV told me I needed to ""man up"". So did my father. ""You can't freeze and panic every time someone says 'boo'"". I know it sounds pathetic, but I just need someone to hold my hand (figuratively, I'm uncomfortable with physical contact still).

Question 2: Is there startup assistance for male DV survivors? I've searched, and what I find sets off my spidey-sense. I could just be paranoid though. 

There's a lot I'm still processing, and may post on it, but I don't think I'll be able to fully til I have the practical stuff sorted.

Thank you,

1he9l5f,Survivor trying to survive,WildestDreams_33,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1he9l5f/survivor_trying_to_survive/,"Hello all.

Over the last year and a half, I‚Äôve been battling severe anxiety and depression due to the number of abuses I dealt with when my ex husband and I were together.

Recently I made a list of everything he‚Äôs done, and it‚Äôs LONG. From physical abuse, whether to me or in my environment to intimidate me. To verbal abuse, telling me I‚Äôm pathetic, garbage, nothing, and more. To emotional abuse, demeaning me and putting in implications, purposely saying and doing things to make me second guess myself, gaslighting, so much more. Financial abuse, taking all of my money and questioning every little purchase I made. He would manipulate me by making comments about my friends and family, saying they were bad people and manipulating me into not talking to them. Making me feel like my world should revolve around him and his needs and if I didn‚Äôt, I was afraid of what could happen.

He made me feel like I was crazy for reacting to his abuse. From age 20-32, I feel like I wasted so much of my life on this unstable man that love bombed me in the beginning and led me to being a divorced woman with nothing to show for myself besides the fact that i‚Äôm now mentally unstable because of this man and I try every day, have been since we divorced, to do and be better and it feels like it‚Äôs not enough to everyone else. Those being my ‚Äúclose‚Äù family members.

What they don‚Äôt understand is that was a HUGE chunk of my life, 12 years of love bombing, into fights once a month, to fights once a week, to fights daily. I know maybe some of the things I retorted with may have not been the best but the majority of what I did was indeed reactive, defensive, and most importantly, out of fear. I know it‚Äôs a two way street. But one street is busier than the other, quite frankly.

Now I‚Äôm living with my parents and it‚Äôs absolute torture. I can see why I gravitated to my ex husband, him and my mother are oddly similar. She tends to emotionally and verbally abuse the most, doesn‚Äôt care about people‚Äôs boundaries, but expects us to hold to her boundaries.

I‚Äôve wanted nothing but my mother‚Äôs love and comfort but I think I‚Äôm done with wanting that. The woman gives me severe anxiety and says rude things about me around me. The thought of having to talk to her gives me anxiety to the point where I‚Äôm shaking.

I need to get out of her house.
It‚Äôs too much.",2024-12-14 18:52:08,2025-03-17 03:15:12,survivor
1ex8bh4,Finding a job as a survivor in a small town. ,redactedanalyst,3,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ex8bh4/finding_a_job_as_a_survivor_in_a_small_town/,"Hiya, friends. 

About two and a half years, I left a partner who was a very typical DV abuser: financial abuse, sexual assault, threats on my reputation, cyberstalking, and continued harassment after I left. When I did leave, I moved far enough away that I wasn't really worried about things, but about a year ago I had to move back to town. Before I moved, he had heard about my impending return through the grapevine and gave me this big obnoxious apology. Foolishly, I accepted it and he started rekindling a friendship with me... but he *started this by propositioning me for sexual favors and offering me resources and financial help in return.* 

This dynamic didn't last longer than a couple of months (I think my newfound confidence/unwillingness to capitulate really upset him) and he has left me well enough alone for the last year and a half. We've even bumped into each other at social gatherings to no conflict, just awkward laughter and avoidance. I have been living fairly happily thinking his need for control over me was done. That was until a couple weeks ago, where he demanded thousands of dollars from me and is threatening legal action if I don't repay it. Keep in mind that all of the money he gave me over the years was 1. offered as a gift 2. I was not given the opportunity to refuse it and 3. was given on the understanding that *this* was the incentive for me to continue to stay with him and tolerate the sexual abuse. 

  
I recently lost my job (due to PTSD symptoms and anxiety, mostly stemming from this situation), am staying with my current partner (who is absolutely darling and 100% safe), and have absolutely no money. I also do not have the mental fortitude to go into a small claims court and seek legal counsel to defend my right to not pay back money that was basically the anvil over my head justifying my rape. I've been working on trying to get a new job for the sake of being able to feed myself (I have recently forgone food more days than not as I sent him everything I had at the time with a note begging for him not to come and find me). I need to find work in town, but I don't know how to get over the anxiety of having *any* job that isn't WFH due to the risk of bumping into him or someone he knows. He always makes little power grabs shortly after I bump into him around town, and I have recently stopped leaving the house (and even attempted to move states, though that was a total bust) to minimize the chances of this escalating into either a legal issue or worsened abuse (yes, I am aware that the situation as it stands now is in and of itself abuse). It's also worth mentioning that my ex is a very well-known and well-respected person in town and I am a relative nobody (save for those who know me through him, to which I have likely been caricatured as a complete monster). 

So uhhh **TL;DR: How should I go about finding and furthering a career when I share a small town with an abuser who recently started making new power grabs?**",2024-08-20 21:59:14,2025-03-17 03:15:13,survivor

My name is Corey, and I am a survivor of domestic violence. After escaping an abusive situation, I now find myself homeless, battling severe mental health challenges, and struggling with heart failure. The combined weight of these hardships has made it nearly impossible for me to support myself financially, and I am in desperate need of help.

Leaving behind an abusive environment was one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever done, but I had hoped it would bring me peace and stability. Instead, I am facing new challenges. My mental health has suffered greatly, making it difficult to function in daily life. On top of this, heart failure has weakened my body, and I‚Äôve been unable to maintain steady work or afford even the most basic necessities like food or shelter.

I am reaching out to ask for help because I simply can‚Äôt do this alone. Accessing  the care I need to start healing‚Äîboth physically and mentally. I have taken a step forward in the healing process which  will allow me to take these critical first steps toward recovery.

Any advice you can give would make a tremendous difference in my life right now. Your support would help me regain some stability and hope for the future‚Äîsomething I desperately need after enduring so much.

While he hasn't purposely physically hurt me yet, there are other signs that shows me that he might get physical eventually. He doesn't respect my physically boundaries and is now stonewalling me whenever I say ""Stop"" and doesn't apologize. He fake punches/kicks me and puts me in chokeholds. He has playfully tortured me with box cutters/sharp knives by holding me down and pretending he's going to stab me. His parents have asked us to watch over their dog multiple times, and whenever the dog is around, he would constantly ""playfully"" threaten her or even expose himself to her. He would lightly slap my face, and when I ask him about it, he says ""I didn't slap you, I tapped you, there's a difference."" At least 5 days out of the week, he would randomly threaten me - like last week for example, he walked into our office and randomly said ""I could end your life right now"". He seems to be super paranoid... would check my phone when I'm not around/ask me about conversations I'm having over the phone (like with my MOM)/if he hears something drop in another room, he would get the sharp kitchen knife before going into the room. I can go on and on and on, but needless to say - I know I need to leave this relationship, but I have a lot of fears.  

I've already called the DV hotline, and they gave me a ton of great tips. But I was wondering if I can also hear stories from those who have successfully escaped a domestic violence situation, and how did that go (from planning to leave, to the actual break up, and then how things went afterwards).

",Embarrassed_Power342,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1g3nbzc/survivors_how_do_you_navigate_tough_convos/,"I (f21) had a tough conversation with my partner (m21) last night regarding trauma related to my former relationship that ended with domestic violence. 

TLDR: How do you know where the line is when sharing about your trauma with your partner? 

From ages 17-19 I was in an abusive relationship. Towards the end it began to get very bad and lives were threatened and it led me to getting a restraining order and staying at home for a month, quitting school and my jobs, I was afraid to leave my house. I continued therapy and still go as it is very helpful and I have made so much growth the past few years. Yet randomly an object of his I could‚Äôve sworn I threw away appeared in my house the other day and it made me feel so triggered. It made me fearful to run my errands and left me feeling trapped in that headspace I was in a few years ago. I don‚Äôt often get so triggered anymore so this caught me off guard. I have been a little on edge since he texted me a few months ago that he still hated me. My partner noticed I was off and asked what was going on. I avoided the conversation worried it would make him uncomfortable. We‚Äôve been together for a year now but I often try to avoid talking about my past relationship as I think it‚Äôs uncomfortable for the both of us. He told me he really wanted to know what was going on, because he wants to understand the ins and outs of my anxiety so he can support me better. I explained how seeing this meaningful object I thought was long gone really triggered me and made me feel so paranoid. He was a great listener and very supportive of everything I shared and telling him about the goals I have to help myself. 

Despite this, some things they said rubbed me the wrong way. I know he has my best interest in mind, and he was not disrespectful at all but I just felt like he doesn‚Äôt understand why being reminded of him makes me so paranoid. He was telling me how my paranoia is extremely abnormal and I shouldn‚Äôt live life that way, that I don‚Äôt have to let things bother me when they come up, and that my goals should revolve on how to be more nonchalant when something comes up again so I won‚Äôt be so triggered. I don‚Äôt know how I will get to that point other than reminding myself I am safe now, and just trying to forget what happened as time passes. I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt know the extend of how things were. I‚Äôve never felt it was appropriate to share anything more than simple details, or focused any conversation about it on the financial abuse and cheating. I‚Äôve never disclosed the more physical and psychological abuse I endured in that relationship outside of therapy and court. When I am reminded of him, I can‚Äôt help but remember how when I finally left and got the restraining order the threats to both my life and his he made and the other damaging things he said. They truly stick with me and I wish those memories could just go away. I am left just feeling so frustrated and guilty for sharing my feelings and somehow alone even when I have someone wanting to be there for me. I‚Äôm trying to just remind myself that I am loved and supported and that he wanted to hear what I was so paranoid about. ",2024-10-14 18:44:08,2025-03-17 03:16:17,survivor

Feeling like a victim after an abusive relationship and constantly thinking why he hurt me. It's like an overwhelming and disgusting feeling of being used, abused and broken down by the person that was supposed to love me. I am very much still trauma bonded and I still miss him. But I have these feelings daily and I feel completely and utterly lost. I know this is not the best mindset to have, because at some point feeling like a victim can actually have a bad effect and you can get stuck feeling like that. I suppose time will make things better.

At what point did you start feeling better? Did it take you months or even years or are you still healing? I am just waiting for the moment of feeling strong but at the moment I am struggling. Is it even possible to heal from domestic violence without any therapy in the future? My self-esteem was already low when I met him but now it's even worse and it feels like he is the one who can fix it. Am aware that it's because of the trauma bond but this is how it genuinely feels like. ",2024-08-08 20:09:32,2025-03-17 03:16:18,survivor

For over a year I have been dating this girl who is a survivors of three years worth of physical and emotional abuse. She has two kids with two separate men aged 2 and 5. The 2 year old is the son of her abuser who has not had contact with him in over a year. She ended the relationship with her abuser January 2023 and still lived with him because of their kid. Throughout the relationship he stalked her and controlled who she spoke to and treated her like an object. April of 2023 he assaulted her in the home and a NCO was put in place. In June of 2023 we went on our first date and that night when she got home, he broke into her home and assaulted her again. Since then all trials dates have been delayed and custody hearing have been delayed which has put stress on her. Everytime a trial date was near she would become emotionally distant but would recover once it‚Äôs passed. In March if this year the alleged final trial date was set and so again she became distant but this trial was move again to June which he plead guilty in open court to 8 felonies and sentencing was put back till August. Since the March date she has been distant with me and says it‚Äôs due to the stress of not knowing what will happen with the sentencing and custody stuff.

Enough context, she is now saying that we need to break up so she can heal. She said she has been healing from the abuse but thinks that her feeling this way for the past few months is due to the abuse and we need to seperate for her to heal. She really does not want to break up but steels like this is a necessary step. I pointed out to her that I don‚Äôt think us breaking up will fix anything and that she needs therapy as her issues are internal
And not with me and only appeared when court came into play. I told her to at least try therapy before we break up which she agreed to. I know that she is stressed and hurting and needs to heal and I know she is acting like this because of all the upcoming court dates. How can I help her heal? I assured her I will always be there for her no matter how long it takes. Even called of our wedding so she can have as much time as she needs to heal.

We spend all of our time together and I mean that, even when she is feeling this way she wants to be around me. I just want to help her. Also have other posts about her story on my account if you want further context.",2024-07-30 18:47:05,2025-03-17 03:16:21,survivor

Please see my last two posts for context.

My abuser was in court this morning for sentencing based on his last attack on his most recent victim.

(We are UK btw)
His sentencing has been postponed and referred to a different court. This basically means that Magistrates Court didn't feel they could sufficiently punish him with their harshest sentence, so on 29th October he will be appearing in Crown Court for his actual sentence. The punishment here will be higher and harsher. He has been identified as the worst type of DV Perpetrator.

This just keeps getting better and better. I am still coaching and supporting the the recent girlfriend through the process I went through 3 years ago and we are healing together. Still a strange way to make a new friend but I'm ok with it.

I moved back to keep custody of my twins, but without good employment since 2018 I am struggling financially.

Has anyone encountered economic abuse from an estranged spouse or stalker? I had a bad date with a guy in 1999 who decided he ""owns me"" but we didn't have an actual relationship. We never even talked again after single date. He broke up marriage in 2000. He may have misrepresented himself as father of my twins and I am worried what that did emotionally and psychologically to 23 year old sons! I worried about ""secrets"" my sons kept away from me.

1euy1g1,8/17/22 I am a survivor of 2 years as of today.,druzyquartzz,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1euy1g1/81722_i_am_a_survivor_of_2_years_as_of_today/,"My name is anon, I am  24 years old. I consider myself one of the lucky ones, meaning I got out alive. So many of us don't make it out alive. I was given a second chance at life. I have made it my purpose to help others like me, like us. I'm doing it for the ones who didn't make it, the ones who dreamed of the better days to come. The ones who felt lost, unheard and alone. I whole heartedly believe our stories need to be shared for them, for their loved ones, we can make an impact bigger than we will ever know. 

Today makes 2 years since my ex almost succeeded in murdering me. My story is very graphic. Telling my story has been a long and draining process. Along my journey I have been writing a book to share my story and others alike. I come here today to talk about this, I have been an inspiration to so many people and I would like to share the stories of those who are to afraid or ashamed to do so on their own, I will do this anonymously. If this is allowed in this group, I would love for those interested to reach out to me. I would be honored to share your story, our stories deserve to be heard. My goal for this book is to save people like us. To make others feel seen, to assure that they are not alone and no matter how hard it is, there is hope. This book, our stories, could be someone's saving grace. It could be a guide for families whos loved ones that are victims of DV. 

You are not alone in this, let me be your voice. I will be publishing this book anonymously. I plan to donate a large sum of the proceedings to DV shelters nation wide, maybe one day even world wide. This book will be NSFW, many of our stories are graphic, trigger warnings will be listed on the first page. I do not want to leave one detail out of my story, it deserves to be heard as it is. Nothing about any of our stories deserves to be censored. We deserve to be heard, the good the bad and the ugly. 

My ex was and still is a narcissist. I have been no contact for one year, we have a daughter together. I was with him for almost 7 years. I was 15 and he was 18, I was groomed. I wont go into depth about my story, but I will share some. He lured me in with love bombing, I thought he was my soulmate. when it was good, it was amazing. It never lasted. one year in is when he began to be physically abusive. Unfortunately I thought it was normal. I grew up being abused by my father, I watched him abuse my mother. Everyone around me was abusive or being abused. My mom was only ever in abusive relationships, I didn't know anything else. I convinced myself every relationship contained abuse. I was wrong, I was so wrong. 

8/17/22 was not the first time he tried to kill me. But, it was the first time I ever experienced death. in the process he hurt my daughter who was 16 m old. He had called 911 and told them he killed me. The police never showed up, in the city I lived in they don't take DV calls seriously. An officer once told me months later that the woman always goes back. All I could think about was how many of us have to die before we are taken seriously? What about the ones who didn't go back? What about the ones they could have saved by just showing up and not leaving their calls unanswered. I didn't make a police report, when the police failed me that day I felt like it didn't matter, like I didn't matter. This book can change that, our stories can change that.  We aren't survivors for no reason. We deserve justice, we deserve to be taken seriously. Authorities ESPECIALLY, should take us seriously. #nomorecallsleftunanswered . 

Even if you haven't escaped yet, your story still deserves to be heard. Hold onto hope, hold onto your dreams for better to come. Hold on to survival. You will be free one day, even when you feel that it is impossible, it is. I say this because I am currently sitting on my couch, in my home, while the love of my life lounges next to me. I met him in November 2022. I never knew love could be so kind, so soft, so genuine. He too is a victim of DV, abuse comes in so many forms. Men suffer abuse too, I'm tired of the stereotypes. Men deserve to be heard without feeling ashamed because they are a man. He was emotionally and verbally abused by his ex, the mother of his child. Together we have learned what love is. I am so thankful to be alive today. I am so thankful I didn't let what I have been through steer me away from the fact that I would truly find love one day. What I once had was not love, no matter how hard I tried to convince myself it was. 

In the last 2 years not only did I find true love, I found home. I am in therapy to process my traumas. I get to be a stepmother to a beautiful little girl. My daughter is Thriving, she gets to have a sister and a best friend the same age to grow up with. I get to watch them both be the best big sisters to the beautiful baby girl i welcomed into this world with the love of my life right by my side. I got to experience a happy and save pregnancy. I got to experience birth with someone who treats me like a goddess that walks this earth, I got to return from the hospital to a safe and happy home. He took care of me and loved me every step of the way. I promise, some way, some how it gets better. You deserve love. You deserve the love you give in return. You ARE worthy of love, happiness, and so much more. 

Leaving is so hard, I don't think it will ever be easy. But our survival, our stories alone could be someone's reason before its too late. I could have been another story you hear on the news, I could have been one of those who didn't get to see better days. I am alive for a reason, I believe everything happens for a reason. I think that saying got me through the darkest times. I told myself every day that it will get better, I will know happiness, I will know love, I will know what it is to truly live. 

I was given a second chance for this very reason. 

Help me bring this reason to life. Let me help you bring your story to so many other people like us. Man, Woman, Non Binary, Trans, all are welcome, all deserve to be shared. I will be your voice. Together we will anonymously change the way people view domestic violence. Together we will help bring understanding. Together we will make a change.

She recently pushed me away after we had an argument. It felt like a pretty mild argument, but at the end of it she walked out and texted me later with some related accusations I'd never heard anything about from her before, and from my perspective, had very little basis in fact. She was talking about how I would never change. To me it read as imminent breakup talk. Now, after a lot of pleading, we seem stable again.

It‚Äôs me again with some more helpful info that many dv survivors/ victims may not know or be aware of (this time concerning strangulation/hands to the throat):

*Most people use being ‚Äúchoked‚Äù and ‚Äústrangled‚Äù interchangeably but there is in fact a difference: 
Choking: an accidental internal obstruction of the airway
Strangulation: a tactic of control and abuse

*The chances of a male strangling their partner is significantly higher than the chances of a female strangling their partner (Women are more prone to strangling a child or someone smaller in size than them) 

*If your partner strangles you they are considered a ‚ÄúStrangler‚Äù and ‚ÄúStranglers‚Äù lead to becoming killers in almost every situation (Could take more than one instance). It is scientifically proven that if they strangle you and you stay they WILL eventually kill you or make a very strong attempt

*If you feel pain in your neck, behind your ears, or in your throat, there is blood vessels burst in your eye(s), small red or purple dots on your face, scalp, eyes, ears, or nose (this is called petechiae), loss of voice or any noticeable change after being strangled PLEASE GO TO A DR! 

* 4.4lbs of pressure placed on the jugular for 10 seconds is necessary to cause unconsciousness. 33lbs of pressure on the trachea is required to completely close it off. If pressure is released immediately consciousness will be regained within 10 seconds. If consciousness is not regained and the person continues the strangulation, urination or using the bathroom on oneself can occur and eventually death can occur after 4-5 min 

Again please feel free to reach out if there are any questions or concerns

As always stay safe‚ù§Ô∏è

1eig6ob,DV survivor need help finding evidence trail,ela_mental,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1eig6ob/dv_survivor_need_help_finding_evidence_trail/,"Hello, 

First time posting but I really need help and Reddit is usually pretty awesome with that. 

I have a difficult situation I hope  you can help out with. I went through DV (domestic violence) that was really intense. I am trying to press charges however the evidence is a little muddied. 

I took a photo of the bruises on my neck. But I hid them in fear that he would find them on my phone. So I hid them in a really old note of mine. I then went a year or 2 later and uploaded them to google drive. So there is no time stamp on the photo of the actual date and time it was taken. And when I go to the history of the photo on the google drive it only shows me the date it was created. 

  
Is there any way to find the old info for the photo. It was taken on a iphone. I do still have the iphone if that helps. 

  
Any help would be awesome. Cross posted. ",2024-08-02 17:37:28,2025-03-17 03:16:37,survivor
1f16le5,A community for partners and friends of survivors,GrayFrogDuty,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1f16le5/a_community_for_partners_and_friends_of_survivors/,"I want to find or help create a forum for friends and partners of abuse survivors.

Can anybody help me find one?

This seems like a really needed resource. I've had to learn from scratch how to be the correct support for my survivor girlfriend. It's been the most difficult thing I've ever had to do, and my only real resource for facts and guidance has been my own mental health counselor. And I'm still figuring things out.

For bonus info, here's my best wisdom so far. This is ""stuff I wish I'd known from day 1.""

**Commenters, PLEASE feel free to suggest more points or edits!**

**1. Just be there**

Don't push. Don't pull. Just respond with positive attention and supporting affirmation when and only when they reach out for it.

**2. General guideline: learn the patterns of abusers, and avoid falling into that pattern when you can**

This is a tough one. It's impossible to be the photo-negative of an abuser, because during the ""calm periods"" they acted like a good partner should act. Don't hold your life and well-being hostage to your partner's trauma, they need to work with you.

**3. There is such thing as too much love**

If you're trying to push them to believe that you're a good one, that counts as pushing. Their abuser love-bombed them and now your partner has an association between lots of love and abuse. Instead, just be what they need, see #1.

Instead of more love, focus on fostering **respect** for them as a person, and their autonomy.

**4. Words are meaningless**

True support is in the doing and being, not talk. Your partner has been suckered by talk before. The more you talk, the more they hear bullshit and are waiting for it to get bad.

**5. They need control**

Their need for control of their life and their world goes **deeper than logic and rationality**. When you get into an argument, you will **not** get out by just being calm and reasonable. They need to be right because being wrong is vulnerability and vulnerability comes right before hurt.

**WARNING:** This might be how the propagation of abused-to-abuser starts! If your partner insists on controlling their world to the point where they're controlling you, THAT IS UNHEALTHY FOR YOU. That means they're not ready for this relationship yet.

When arguments happen, I'm still not sure what to do. My best advice so far is, listen, validate what they feel, let them know in general terms that your perspective is different. Don't win the argument, but I guess pause it to give them time to figure it out on their own. Compromise where it's reasonable for you.

**6. Recognize how small a taking of control can be**

They'll feel loss of control in the tiniest things. Offering help with daily tasks. Making suggestions for their home or life (including therapy/counseling/healing process). Offering to drive, or pay for something. This is how their abuser took control.

On the other hand, a healthy relationship requires these concessions. You can be sensitive, but for the relationship to continue, they'll need to learn that trust.

**7. Be ready to be pushed away**

You will be pushed away. Usually after a disagreement or argument that seems like nothing. **You need your life to be in a place where you're OK without them while they have the space they need.** Otherwise, you're not ready to be in a relationship with them.

Do NOT pull them back in. See #1.

**8. Bolster your own emotional support network**

You need your life to be OK without them, before you can help them. You need people to talk to about what you're going through. You need someone who can tell you if the relationship you're in is becoming the propagation of abused-to-abuser. Have family, have a counselor, have friends.

**9. If they're not trying to heal themselves, then you can't support them yet**

They should at least be at the point where they recognize that their trauma exists, and taking some sort of steps to heal. Journaling, counseling, self-help books, group support, something. If they're pretending there's no problem, then they're not ready for a romantic relationship.

**Final acknowledgement**

You need to be in a healthy relationship. A lot of the advice above is a slippery slope for keeping yourself in an unhealthy situation. There is a balance between being sensitive to your partner's needs, and being held hostage by their trauma. You can support them, but they need to be working with you. Don't get caught in the trap of ""I can fix them,"" because that's not your role. They need to be in charge of healing themselves, and you are only one support and resource among many others.",2024-08-25 20:52:26,2025-03-17 03:16:38,survivor

I am 3+ years free from my abuser of 5 years. I'm trying to find a local or online support group I can attend for non active DV recovery. 

I still have panic attacks, and am triggered by certain scenarios with my new partner. I have to remind myself I am safe constantly when something comes up, I have to do my grounding exercises, and practice my patience with myself. I am angry, and scared, and sad that I'm stuck like this. It's not all the time, but it's more than a ""normal"" person. I have to work really hard to feel okay, even 3 years later.

I told my therapist (who I stopped seeing because I lost insurance) that I'm not in it anymore, so I haven't gone to a group. I don't feel like I am at risk right now, and I don't want to use resources meant for people who are actively in danger. She helped me reframe it by asking how long I would get help for myself if I was sick or physically injured, and the answer is until I'm better. Ergo I should get help with my trauma until I'm better. 

I don't know where to go though, I'm not sure what resources are available to me. I can't afford therapy for my recovery. Everytime I search online I just find DV shelters, emergency support, or trauma therapy. I'm hoping to find an AA style group for DV survivors, but I'm not sure where to go for it. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. I am located in the US, DM me for more specific location information.

Much thanks in advanced üíû to anyone who is in active abuse just know it does get better, even if it sticks with you.",2024-02-10 00:18:02,2025-03-17 03:16:50,survivor

If it‚Äôs not I apologize in advance. I 28(f) just got divorced a year ago now and just started to step back into the dating world. A short back story on the 10 years I was married, my ex husband was extremely abusive physically / emotionally. He also was a pathological liar / cheater. We have 1 daughter together and I finally had the strength to leave a year and a half ago because I wanted to save my daughter from that environment, while also saving myself because the abuse continued to get worse. I am forever grateful to have made it out alive because I know that‚Äôs not the reality for a lot of DV survivors. 

Fast forward a year & 1/2 to me being single, figuring out my life as a new single mom. I have slowly considered the idea of dating again.I Met a guy (27m) and he is all the things I could ask for in a guy. Kind, caring, considerate, understanding about me being a single mom ( he has not met my daughter because I have a strict 8-12 month rule for anyone to meet her) and goes above & beyond for me for the past 3 months we‚Äôve been seeing each other but now I‚Äôm starting to notice similarities between him and my ex. He‚Äôs expressed how he doesn‚Äôt like my mom ( which my ex used to do aka leading to isolation) how I need to move away from my parents. Then a today he confessed to me that he was physically abusive in his last ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship about 8 years ago but has gotten counseling since and has never done it again. A big obvious red flag but the empath in me understands how people can make mistakes and not repeat them. The advice I‚Äôm seeking is has anyone had a partner tell you about them doing something like this in their past but has never seen them do that going forward. Overall my instinct tells me this is my sign to move on from him. I know the obvious answer is to cut it off but after being in a abusive relationship for so long, it can distort your reality / perspective on things. Please be kind.

I‚Äôm (27F) a survivor of DV. Most of it was emotional, mental, and sexual abuse. I left my abuser about 5-6 years ago and I am married to the man of my dreams(25M). 

I have a problem with saying how I feel when I feel it and I end up keeping everything in until the most inconvenient moment, since I wasn‚Äôt really allowed to voice my opinion in my last relationship. My husband has a problem with that and he doesn‚Äôt understand and last night he said I was retreating to my ‚Äúold ways‚Äù I tried to tell him I‚Äôm still healing and it‚Äôs so fucking hard for me.

We don‚Äôt fight, but we do disagree but we never let it get to a blow up because I can‚Äôt handle that. 

FF to today and he sent me a tiktok about how kids are struggling to pay for things and aren‚Äôt paid a livable wage and I told him I hope it gets better for when our future kids grow up they don‚Äôt have to deal with these struggles. I guess I was wrong to say that because he told me that was not was he was referring too and that he doesn‚Äôt care about other kids we don‚Äôt have right now.

Now im internally freaking out because his one thing he says is that I don‚Äôt listen to him but I do, I just have really bad memory issues and I forget a lot of things sometimes. 

How long until I can feel normal again? Why does healing take so fucking long, im over all of this shit at this point. I have to try my hardest just to not get offended because of something my husband says when he‚Äôs joking around.

We argue sometimes. Or to be more accurate I get defensice and argue until he shows any sign of frustration or arguing back and then I act like hes being abusive.

I lived 2500miles from my family and just left my husband of 11years. I spent 4 years in and out of this cycle of abuse. I was beaten every 3 days, strangled, ran over with my own vehicle...I sent my kids away before becoming homeless. For YEARS I would break free and get sucked right back in. Trauma is the reason. I felt like I deserved it. I had been stuck in fight or flight since I was 2. 

In 2016 I found myself homeless, in Las Vegas, with my abuser jailed and beaten by the police. He was released with a broken jaw.  Retribution I believe.  He was on meth and locked himself in a closet.  When he came out he was handing me his teeth as he pulled them from his jaw freaking out. That was the last time I spoke with him.  

I traveled from Phoenix, to Vegas,  to California, to Memphis all by myself. My balls dropped in Vegas the 4th time I was almost kidnapped. I've been fearless every since. 

In 2017 I stole a vehicle and got locked up in Texas. Then transferred to Mississippi after 12 months to answer for the vehicle I stole. In the mean time,  a man that I met along the way was signing for 25 years in Louisiana for an armed robbery I initiated. I beat the bullet and get very lucky. 

I have spent the last 6 years processing through ALL of my trauma.  EMDR saved my brain and my life. I've worked in the Recovery field for 2 years. I spend 45+ hrs a week talking about what I've put myself through and how I was able to get out of it.

It took me 7 and 8 years to get my kids back. They spent the time with their father being neglected and abused. They are a product of my decisions and I work tirelessly every day to make sure they have what they need. Services for mental health, love and encouragement and the idea that you can change. You can process through your shit and have everything you deserve. I've remarried to a man that is also in recovery. Together we are a powerhouse and will not stop until these kids heal. 

You can go through hell, put yourself through the worst and put yourself back together.  You can thrive and have happiness and love.",2023-08-25 18:01:21,2025-03-17 03:17:03,survivor

We lived together for 5 years. It was very difficult mentally to leave but when I did I got up and made a plan to leave physically. It is very dangerous for domestic violent victims to leave their abuser. It is much safer for the abuser to abandon their supply. None the less I‚Äôve been free from my abusive ex with the help of a no contact order for almost two years now. When I look around I do not see any healthy relationships around me. A good 3 of them I would say are as bad as mine was and these people will trauma dump on me and say that they need to leave and then a week later will worship the men that love bomb them. I see the cycle and I thought living the cycle was hard but I find my opened eyes watching others continue their own cycle is wayyyy harder. I‚Äôve reached the point of removing some of the people from my Snapchat or other social media. I give them perspective and opinions but they stay anyways and I guess in a way I feel unheard and hurt to watch the cycle start again. I just want true happiness for everyone and for them true happiness doesn‚Äôt seem be their priority. Only ‚Äúfixing‚Äù their broken relationships that has had boundaries crossed and moments that they will never be able to forgive but they are able to forget for large moments. Bringing up the horrific moments only when it uplifts the new argument to have an upper hand maybe.. Idk if it‚Äôs just me or if maybe misery likes company and I‚Äôm no longer in that moment so maybe it is them and I just need different friends.,2023-09-08 12:40:09,2025-03-17 03:17:07,survivor

On the way to the airport he pulled over right by the airport driveway. He gave me a few items he had taken when I had left him. Then he put a gun into my back. He told me to look off at the sunset and it would all be over with, I told him to fuck off. I didn't hear the gun go off just felt the heat of the bullet going in my back.  I grabbed the gun and the steering wheel pulling the car off the road into a field. He managed to shot me two more times in the chest before the gun jammed and I was able to open the door. As the Corvette swearved back onto the road I leaned out allowing myself to be thrown from the car. It was the last time I saw him alive. It was also the last time I would walk.

But nothing on my question.

Has any survivor here had an abuser tell them that the abuse was caused by YOUR depression, anxiety, PTSD, mania, OCD, bipolar, etc. etc.? Or any expressions of those things (i.e. you just had to keep mentioning the thing you are anxious about too many times that day, or you were so hyperfocused on manic problem-solving that you were not ""in the relationship"" to their satisfaction)?

Also, has any survivor here had an abuser tell them the abuse was caused by you being autistic and having meltdowns or shutdowns?

My person has at varying times named these types of things as ""my abusive behaviours."" I wondered how common this is. Presumably, I'm a survivor, but no one has managed to convince me of it yet. I am always worried I am the aggressor. I wondered if the complaints he has made are common ones from other aggressors. Naturally, I also wonder if he is right.

Incidentally, he also blames me for ""triggering his PTSD."" I do see the contradiction here in his reasoning. Me being anxious for weeks (an expression of emotional trauma) is ""abusive."" But him responding through black rage ""because"" I triggered his PTSD (another expression of emotional trauma) is merely a response to my ""abuse."" I have a hard to explaining the double standard there, but I am pretty sure there is one.

Eventually the physical pain will subside and I will forget the way it feels to be hit with something I never once would have considered to be dangerous. 

Just a day later--when this recent wound is still tender, I am confident that the silent shame following me around is a far more effective tormentor than you ever were. 

The minimally displaced base fracture on my fifth metacarpal healed. 
The purple discoloration surrounding my left eye has returned to my normal skin tone. 
The laceration covering half of my forehead will likely leave a small scar to serve as a subtle reminder of how foolish I have been, but It too will soon be an afterthought. 

That being said, I know I will not forget the way my peers looked at me yesterday morning when I arrived at work. Because how do you respect a person when you learn these terrible things about the interworkings of their life? 

The humiliation I feel as I sit here and pretend its not there will be an intangible and unavoidable torture that will be with me forever. 

So no. 

I don't want to be a survivor. 
I don't want to be damaged. 
I dont need a ribbon, a month, or another god damn hashtag. 
I just want to be fucking normal again.

This agony reminds me of why words like secrets exist.

This will be the third time I have to show up at work again with evidence of your anger and addictions on my face.  

Barb Simpson said it best, it doesnt matter how you feel on the inside, its whats on the surface that counts. 

I am most disappointed because my office used to be a safe place where i was well liked. Unfortunately, the majority of my peers are judgemental and the rest have become too uncomfortable to look at me. 

Each time i arrived with an obvious injury, the distrust of my character grew. I dont think this was intentional--after all, even on the most primal level, weakness simply isnt tolerated in the game where survival is a prize only awarded to the fittest. 

There were several days that I stayed at work long past 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I was terrified to return back home. I didn't want to find my Q drunk, dead, or passed out.

Had i been asked outright back then by any potential friendly, i likely would have just broke down and asked for help, but I was neither approachable or vulnerable. 

When i arrived with a broken hand, i pretended it wasnt swollen. When i showed up with a laceration across my face i stood up in front of 75 people and gave a sound presentation that i am almost certain did not reach a single person--not really anyway. 

So, eleven months after the first incident, i arrived today  with a broken heart, one good eye, and one black eye. Nobody said a word, but i know they know. 

This agony reminded me of why words like secrets exist. It feels like i detailed every gruesome scream in a single email and forwarded it like a superstitious chain letter. 

Im naturally very private, thats easier still when my shame breeds silence and reinforces the idea that i am the local unsolved mystery and page 7 freak of the week. While secrets dont make friends, they do keep the local people and their quesrions at bay. 

When I wake up, I listen for movements before I open my eyes. It's a heavy weight on my chest these days and waking up to the the pain of existing is mildly better than every day that i could be dead in the god damn ground. 

You gave all the bad things better names which let me stay hidden for far too long from all the demons in disguise. Ive been coexisting with evil my whole life and i think ive caused my internal warning system to malfunction. Arrogantly, i thought i had escaped the daily abuse of my early years.

The familiar gossip that surrounds me now only revealed that im simply on a repeating loop fueled by the speculation of those peering down from their ivory towers of pretty boxes filled with ticky tacky. 

What i need to get off my chest is that I hate that i am broken, i hate that i am stupid, I hate that i feel like a mistake. 

I only have myself to blame and i know its cliche but i dont wanna be me anymore. 

So in the next week when you realize i'm gone, all you'll find is a note with two seemingly simple things no longer left to do.

I (F28) spent 4.5 years in a relationship (2014-2018) with a very very abusive man- made high risk and police priority lists for a long time. We have a child together (2017). I ended relationship in July 2018, finished court proceedings in 2019 with a 5-11 year sentence (yay for a victory with the justice system after many failed cases!!)  Been in therapy since 2016, still actively go twice a month, and take medications for my depression, anxiety, PTSD, and mixed-bipolar. 

I have had to ""terminate"" or ""love from a distance"" two friends (both F28) in the past year or two; both friendships were slowly degrading with time. Friend 1 is in a physically abusive relationship (partner forced two miscarriages before allowing her to successfully carry a third pregnancy to term); friend 2 *was* in an emotionally abusive relationship, but has since left and established serious toxic coping mechanisms, and the final straw was calling me a bad friend because i wouldn't give her any of my prescription narcotics (she is a recovered addict)... 

I tried countless times to be a good friend and be supportive. But i had to walk away from both. It felt as though I was triggered every time friend 1 was assaulted, because she'd come to my house when it wasn't safe there. She said i was a bad friend because i ""never make time to visit,"" the abusive household. Friend 2 has very very negative mindset, continued to tell me i had life handed to me (brought up things from when i was a teen that i don‚Äôt even remember, and i'm a single mother in nursing school; no one can do the work for me but me), always finding negatives in my healthy relationship, etc. And both repeatedly told me ""i changed,"" and ""not the person they know"" which i think was always the point, because that person i was allowed people to abuse her -- i began to feel like these friends were abusive in other ways. 

i guess i just want to know if i am justified in what i feel like is protecting my own peace that i have worked tirelessly to get? My life has made a drastic turn around since 2018, changes i never thought i was able to accomplish, and it is hard having ""friends"" tell me i am a bad friend for needing space and time away. Friend 1 is still involved in her relationship, we havent spoken in over a year; i don‚Äôt think i will ever rekindle the friendship, but i still battle with if i ""abandon"" her. There were also countless conversations about my needs as a friend in the dynamic of the friendships; cutting them off was the last resort.

And to add, i understand the dynamics of abuse and why people cant leave; i cycled for many years. i also hurt and lost a lot of people along the way, but i could never blame those people because for so long i did ""love"" my abuser more than them.

TLDR: survivor (28F) out of abusive relationship for 5 years; hard to be friends with friends who are still in abusive relationships/displaying toxic behaviors and no sign of change/wanting to change.",2023-04-29 14:16:53,2025-03-17 03:18:26,survivor

I was reading up on the recently passed Secure 2.0 Act for my job and came across something that I thought was interesting and worth sharing.

This may be something that could help someone in your life. 

The Act makes a provision for DV survivors to take money out of their retirement plans or IRA‚Äôs without incurring the normal 10% penalty on an early withdrawal.

The plan has to allow it but there really isn‚Äôt any reason a plan shouldn‚Äôt make this change.

All IRA‚Äôs are automatically included because they aren‚Äôt governed by plan documents but by federal legislation.

The only requirement is that the employee/participant has to self-certify that they are DV survivors. This also takes effect on Jan 1 2024 so it really only counts on distributions after 12/31/23.

Also, the guideline states that the allowed amount is ‚Äúup to the lesser of $10k indexed or 50% of the vested balance) within one year of incident‚Äù

It‚Äôs just something I‚Äôd like to make people aware of.

Thanks for reading!

And tonight I had this epiphany that I need to start with myself....

I need to write MY STORY and do photos of ME first.

I would like others' thought on both ideas ..

NOTE: I go to therapy weekly (in the past long term biweekly was a thing for 9+ months), I‚Äôve been seeing my therapist for 6 years. Rarely missing an appointment. I also do A.R.T therapy with my therapist. Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) ‚Äî an eye-movement therapy designed to decrease the emotional reactivity and distressing symptoms experienced following stressful or traumatic events.

Anyways, I left my DV situation (physical, mental, and emotional) in April of 2018- (which was for about 2.5 years) In January of 2019 I met my now husband. Married in mid 2020. Now we have one child together. 

In therapy, I work on processing through my trauma and trying to get back the person i once was before my trauma from the guy I was with. I know I will never be the same, but I can try to get her back the best I can. 

I have always struggled with letting my guard down with my husband. I only want my pets/therapist when I get into a depressive episode, flashback, panic attack or any type of intense feelings/thoughts/memories. Through therapy we discovered that this is because the intensity of my trauma and through my ART therapy I will let him back in. Even though in my head I know my husband is such a safe person and loving man. The trauma still lives within and I can‚Äôt let him in to help because it makes me feel vulnerable again. I try so hard to not feel vulnerable with him because of how vulnerable I was in my DV situation. 

I want my husband to see me vulnerable and to help me when I am. My therapist says it‚Äôs going to take more time. But I am just posting here in hopes someone has been through something similar and has some advice. Thank you for taking the time to read. Thank you a billion times more if you have some advice.",2023-04-05 16:19:57,2025-03-17 03:18:31,survivor

yipo21,DC Police are now mandated and trained to connect all domestic violence survivors they encounter with counselors by phone.,NathanBacaNews,33,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/yipo21/dc_police_are_now_mandated_and_trained_to_connect/," I'm the WUSA9 reporter on this story. Some of you may remember the December 2021 death of Sylvia Matthews. She was the DC woman who police say was stalked for 20 years and murdered by her stalker despite calling MPD multiple times in the weeks before, and day of, her murder. We highlighted that murder and pressed for changes. Now, it's happened.

DC Police and DC SAFE, the domestic violence counseling hotline, came to an agreement with training to back it up. When an MPD officer encounters a domestic violence survivor in the field, that officer must call the hotline at 844-443-5732 with the survivor present. The officer is to connect that survivor to a counselor so emergency help options are given over the phone, not just by business card.

I've witnessed how this helped domestic violence survivors first hand by interviewing people on both sides of that crucial phone call. On a personal note, I'm happy to have played some role in getting MPD and DC SAFE to work together more - and grateful to the Matthews family for their advocacy. I can try to answer any redditors questions.

Included in the packet was a mostly blank sheet of paper that is giving me the opportunity to make a victim impact statement.  (A quick slice of background information) My ‚Äúex?‚Äù Is currently incarcerated without bail for multiple attacks on myself and my property.

The problem?:
I am not over him.  If he wasn‚Äôt locked up, I would most likely be making the same mistake again and trying to work on things.  I am very much in the stage where I am disassociating from the event, thinking about what I did wrong, remembering all of the wonderful things about him and most of all missing him desperately.  
I don‚Äôt want to miss my chance to be heard but I also fear that writing certain things may negatively affect the outcome of his trial.  I put money on his books a few weeks ago and was told by someone from the organization that is helping me not to do that again because his lawyer will try to use that against me during trial.

I‚Äôm looking for some guidance/advice from those with experience on what to stray away from writing.  Or even that, being at this part of my recovery, it might be in my best interest to not write a victims impact statement.",2023-04-03 20:54:37,2025-03-17 03:18:37,survivor

After what I thought was a loving relationship quickly turned verbal abusive he construction put me down, accused me of cheating and other things. 

One evening one of our arguments got a little heated, then it stopped I thought that was the end of it but he tried ending my life. The next morning my mum came to get me (as we were living together) after about two weeks of apologies and gifts I went back to him. I know I shouldn't have but I loved him. We started off again like it did at the beginning until I started working, he'd constantly accuse me of cheating, always checked up on me, came in to my place of work to make sure I was working. If I came home late (I was made to walk home even at night) he'd accuse me of cheating. 

Finally one day I had enough and a few months before I was 21 I called my mum and we moved all my stuff out but not within him trying to manipulate me into staying. I ignored him and left but it didn't stop he would constantly turn up to were I was staying, send me gifts, he even invited himself to my 21st birthday meal. After Christmas I was finally fully free of him until one day I had a male friend over someone who gave me the confidence to leave him after being in a similar situation with his ex girlfriend. My ex turned up at the place I was staying and barged his way in and attacked my friend as he thought we were ""sleeping"" together which wasn't true I tried to stop him but I ended up getting thrown into a wall by my ex. The police were involved over the attack but at the time I didn't want to press charges because I was too shaken up. I don't know if my friend did but it was me who mainly got hurt in the process.

Now I am fully free of my ex, it has taken it's time but I am healing, I am married with a 3 year old. This year 2022 I went to the police and made a report about everything although it's a game of he said she said and have closed the case I feel better about telling someone what had happened.

y3il3o,DV survivor going through it again,Ita_Angel,6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/y3il3o/dv_survivor_going_through_it_again/,"I (27) grew up with domestic violence, the abuser being my father. I have undiagnosed anxiety and most likely PTSD. ( yes I‚Äôve attempted to get help but let‚Äôs say that experience was less than ideal , I‚Äôll try again soon I‚Äôm sure just traumatized at the moment ) but my father has relapsed and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Any advice? 

Here‚Äôs the back story:
My dad has been an alcoholic since I could remember. He was very abusive to my mom and I could never understand why. 
He would always go on these drunk rampages about stupid things like not locking the door or us dropping something on accident. 
I‚Äôve learned to not slam things or stomp my feet purely to make sure I couldn‚Äôt make him mad. I‚Äôve now adopted this into my normal life that I get a mini panic attack if someone starts yelling or if I heard someone slam something. 
Two years ago I finally had enough and couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I lived at home with my sick mom and my dad. He came home one night so drunk he blamed us for things I didn‚Äôt even understand - such as us talking bad about him with his brethren in his lodge, snooping through his things, and more. He use to be in the military and I‚Äôm 1000% sure he has undiagnosed PTSD and paranoia. 
I had had enough and told him to stop it and tell me what is wrong so I can help him. One thing lead to another and he threatened to kill us after trying to back me into a corner and hurt me. He‚Äôs never hit me ever until now. This wasn‚Äôt the first time he has threatened to kill us though but this time I was extremely afraid he would purely by his eyes. He took out his gun and everything. He left after that and went for a drive. I called my sister and told her what happened. I got my mom and we went to my room. I put a space heater and a few other things in front of my door just in case and told my mom to go to sleep. I didn‚Äôt sleep that night, I stayed up and waited till he got home. I researched everything I could for help.
I made a plan to grab anything important and leave while he slept.
He came home at 3am made sure we knew too by honking the horn to wake us and maybe even the neighbors up. Got in the house and slammed the door to his room shut. Shook the house.

My mom and I got our things and left with the dog to a family friends house for help in the morning. We called the cops and he was put in jail for 24 hours. We had 24 hours to get everything together and get out. Which we did. After our court hearing we asked the judge to not put him in jail only if he agreed to getting counseling  on anger management and vowing to stay sober. Judge gave it for 18 month requirement with monthly check in on alcohol.

Since then my sister, brother in law, nephew, and mom went back home with him because purely he was so much better and wasn‚Äôt drinking. We were all happy! 
I ended up moving to Texas with my husband. 


Now it‚Äôs 2022, it‚Äôs happening again. We noticed earlier in the year that he was starting to pick up drinking again. He‚Äôd come home late but never buzzed or drunk. He didn‚Äôt know we knew at the time (we track his location). Lately he‚Äôs been coming home buzzed and or drunk. His anger is back to how it was prior to us leaving before. He almost hurt my nephew (2 years old) while yelling about who chipped his mug and throwing it in the direction of the baby.
They live together so it‚Äôs a little harder this time to up and leave like before. I also live out of state so I can‚Äôt just fly up to help..

Since it‚Äôs started I can barely sleep or eat a whole meal. I think I‚Äôve eaten maybe a one whole meal in the last 4 days. 
All I want is my family to be safe and my dad to get the help he needs.. before he loses his whole family permanently this time.",2022-10-14 03:20:44,2025-03-17 03:18:44,survivor

My situation is really bizarre because it started out with mainly verbal abuse as a small child, but escalated to serious, brutal physical abuse when I was around 7-16. My dad abused both me and my mom, but my mom also abused me too. I used to fight back and whenever I did my parents would start recording me to have ‚Äúevidence‚Äù against me if I ever attempted to report them. When I was 16, my family packed up and moved a few hours away from where I grew up. After that, the physical abuse mainly stopped, just the occasional slap which, to me at the time, was nothing. My parents always told me that they stopped bc they realized they made mistakes, but they continued to manipulate me and verbally and emotionally abuse me until I moved out at 18. As I‚Äôve gotten older, I think they stopped physically abusing me because I was getting too old to keep quiet about why I constantly had cuts, burns, and bruises. 
Here is why I struggle calling myself a DV survivor: I still keep in contact with them. My family has always been well off and so when I was in college I maintained a relationship with them so they‚Äôd pay for my school. Now I keep in contact with them so they‚Äôll pay for my upcoming wedding. They‚Äôve given me a car, paid my rent for years while I was in school, and will undoubtedly offer me more if I attempt to cut them off and do it on my own as I have in the past. I feel immensely guilty because not only does this make me feel dirty and cheap for putting a price on my trauma, but I also feel ungrateful because this level of financial security at my age is such a massive privilege. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do about all of this. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs right to finally cut them off or if it‚Äôs just me being spoiled and ungrateful. What I do know is that I don‚Äôt feel like my story will have an end until I cut contact with them, so right now I struggle to call myself a DV survivor.",2022-08-30 22:55:07,2025-03-17 03:18:45,survivor

dbx1h2,Brain Injury in 81% of Reported DV Survivors,Concussion-GamePlan,29,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/dbx1h2/brain_injury_in_81_of_reported_dv_survivors/,"Domestic Violence Awareness Month and Brain Injury - Of the intimate partner violence (IPV) survivors who seek help, 81% of them have suffered a head injury and 83% have been strangled. Brain injury is intimately tied to abuse and violence. 


1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men will experience some form of physical violence from a partner, with even higher statistics in marginalized populations such as people of color and LGBTQ+ populations. Intimate partner violence is the cause for a large proportion of brain injuries. This includes traumatic brain injury (TBI) from whiplash and physical beatings as well as acquired brain injury (ABI) from strangulation and oxygen deprivation.  


Of those who are seen in the ER, 70% of IPV survivors will never be identified as such. (Hospital staff will either never identify or never address the violence in 70% of cases.) In addition, the invisible wounds of a brain injury are often overshadowed by more visible trauma like broken bones and bruises. This lack of identification of both IPV and TBI virtually eliminates the possibility of connecting these survivors with proper resources. 


Brain injuries are linked to highly increased rates of mood disorders such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. IPV survivors who suffer from brain injuries are at an even higher risk. We need to better highlight these brain injuries so that survivors seeking help can be properly identified and treated.

Knowing to look out for brain injury can improve the care survivors are given from hospital staff, police, and judges. Knowing memory loss and confusion are symptoms can prevent an outsider from assuming the survivor is lying. Knowing that personality disorders, aggression, and frontal lobe issues are symptoms can help explain why this survivor is not getting along well with shelter roommates, etc. Knowing executive function and planning issues are symptoms can help someone from assuming the survivor is purposefully avoiding court, etc when in reality they just honestly forgot. 


Concussion GamePlan works on the PINK Concussions IPV Task Force, which works to compile an international network of resources for these survivors. If you are in an abusive relationship, resources are available. Call 911 for immediate help, or 1-800-799-SAFE to reach a DV hotline. You can also text ‚ÄúSTART‚Äù to 741741 for any type of crisis.",2019-10-01 17:56:32,2025-03-17 03:18:49,survivor

Staff and the other residents act like I am lying about everything in my past, everything I am currently saying, etc, and keep intentionally giving me horrible advice and making promises they don't intend to keep, they (staff and residents) are making fun of me/my situation, they make fun of where I'm from, and they are hoping to sabotage anything good I have going for me.
Since I've left him almost 2 months ago now, I've been told that I dont even qualify as DV anymore, yet I feel I never got the healing and help I needed to begin with!!
I have no family, a friend back home but they can't help. I'm beside myself and massively depressed. What do I do??",2025-03-17 02:39:43,2025-03-17 15:15:04,help

These were my encounters that are signs of DV 

Emotional: 
- Cussing at me (using foul language in arguments) 
- Calling me horrible names (b*tch, c*nt, stupid, etc)
- Disregarding my feelings to make his feelings seem bigger 
- Telling me I shouldn‚Äôt wear more ‚Äúrevealing‚Äù clothes because I‚Äôd be seeking men‚Äôs attention
- Constantly asking ‚Äúwho I‚Äôm trying to look good for‚Äù anytime I‚Äôd put a little more makeup on than usual, or do my hair 
- Saying or doing awful things to me behind closed doors, but making me feel guilty and like I‚Äôm the bad guy if anyone found out about some of the things he said or did 

Physical:
- Isolating me from my friends by saying he doesn‚Äôt like them and trying to make them seem awful (and I‚Äôm not seeing it because they‚Äôre my friends) 
- Using scare tactics during arguments: furrowing brows, showing teeth, clenching jaw
- Yelling during arguments
- Escalation from slamming his hands down during arguments, to throwing items, to throwing items at me, to grabbing me, to throwing me onto bed and pinning me down 
- Also slapping me on occasion (but never the face) 
- Driving erratically with me in the car 

There are a lot of other things he‚Äôd say or do, smaller in detail, that I won‚Äôt list here. But if anyone has questions on if what they‚Äôre experiencing is DV, please reach out. I wish I found a post like this when I was experiencing it, because at the time I couldn‚Äôt decipher if what I was experiencing was normal or abusive. Overall he was a very aggressive, narcissistic, and controlling man that could hide it well with the lovey dovey that he showed me 75% of the time. ",2025-03-15 14:33:57,2025-03-17 16:06:05,signs

- He told me I am lucky to have him and will never find a man like him. 
- My husband always gives me the silent treatment.
- My always refuses my food after going through so much stress of cooking just to hurt my emotions after an argument. 
- I am now so afraid of communicating with my husband because he gets angry and raises his voice at me whenever I try to communicate my feelings to him. 
- My husband is the perfect husband in one minute and plays with my emotions the next minute. 
- I have to first beat around the bush in order to have a discussion about our life with my husband because I am afraid he will get mad the moment I start. 
- My husband is in so much debt and doesn‚Äôt like discussing this with me. He always gets angry and starts to ignore me whenever I asked to know the exact amount he is owning. 
- My husband always gets angry whenever I am chatting with someone he doesn‚Äôt know about before. I am from a very large family and I sometimes get messages from family members I haven‚Äôt heard from in years. ( Example; This morning, I got a message from a cousin I haven‚Äôt heard from for more than 14 years ). My husband will want to see proof even after telling him the person is a family. 
 - My husband once told me to fuck off during an argument. 
- He told me I can‚Äôt send money home to my family because he doesn‚Äôt send to his family. 
- He sometimes asks me how will I stay in UK if we separate. This is because I am in UK on spouse visa. 
- At times, I will cry and cry but he will pretend he doesn‚Äôt hear anything. 
- I am not making any contribution to our expenses ( rent and food). This is because he doesn‚Äôt want me to contribute anything and we are currently staying in a shared apartment. I have tired to speak with him about renting our own private apartment with me contributing to all the expenses but this conversation always ends up in argument. 
- Like I said, he has so many debt and I offered to help him with some of the monthly payments ( like over payment). This is because I feel his debt is causing me anxiety and we are not living a normal life because of this. I sent him ¬£1,800 out of the ¬£3,000 I had about three days ago to do some overpayment and we ended up fighting because I asked him how much he has left after paying the 1800 I gave him. He sent me a screenshot from lendable one of his debts which I do not understand. He said I should have understood the screenshot if I was intelligent enough. My plan was to keep helping till all his debts are fully paid.

I‚Äôve been seeing someone for about 8 months. Things have been rocky from the start. I have been wondering if he is intentionally emotionally and psychologically abusing me for about 3 months. 

The problem is I have up and moved to a new state for this person. I know. 

TLDR he love bombed me. I thought he was a free spirit so I brushed it off. I came to find out he is not, he‚Äôs methodical almost to a fault about everything. Then came the jokes and commentary; about my makeup, clothes, tattoos. I have gone to such lengths as getting my tattoos removed. And then the fights. Everything is my fault bc I am immature, sensitive, unhappy. The issue is I don‚Äôt feel this way usually and I don‚Äôt often hear this feedback. So I believe he could be right. It doesn‚Äôt feel right though. The fights always begin when he is jumping down my throat and I lash out or if I start a conversation when I try to express my feelings. He always tells me he isn‚Äôt going to fall for my manipulative shtick I have used on other men to get my way. He won‚Äôt say that we are boyfriend/girlfriend but he speaks like we are together and plans as if we are. We have things planned months and months in advance that are pretty serious. I haven‚Äôt really believed it all to be true. I thought he was emotionally abusive and then we talked‚Ä¶and talked‚Ä¶and talked and he opened up more and I chose to believe that he is just a tough nut to crack. And then things became great. He started to open up emotionally and physically SO much more. 

And to be honest things have been good. Until tonight when I told him sarcastically / jokingly to ‚Äúfucking relax‚Äù after he started bashing me for a (admittedly) dumb idea I had. It was totally innocent and my past boyfriends would‚Äôve laughed it off or been like ‚Äúhell yeah sure babe!‚Äù 

I was then lashing out and being disrespectful. As usual he lectured me for about 10 minutes on how I need to act like myself and ask for what I want to be happy. Because lashing out and blaming him for my feelings isn‚Äôt going to work. I didn‚Äôt understand bc I didn‚Äôt feel like I was the one being mean? I just said one comment. 

Anyway, as usual I tried once or twice to say ‚ÄúI feel‚Äù statements that were interrupted until I just said I understand and I am sorry. Then he told me (jokingly) I‚Äôm a fucking piece of shit and he hates me. And he ‚Äúplay‚Äù slapped me. He said it feels good and I should try it. I said I don‚Äôt want to and he told me I don‚Äôt want to have fun. So I said it and he play slapped me some more until I started to brush away his hand.

Is this a sign for what is to come? ",2024-09-16 04:04:52,2025-03-17 16:06:15,signs

I then moved out and we have a no contact order in place. 

In that same night, before the anger started, he was kissing me on the couch fully clothed and he grabbed me by the neck and pinned me down like that for about 3 seconds. I don‚Äôt really like that and something about it really scared me because I could sense some low level agitation starting in him. It confuses me because we weren‚Äôt arguing yet, but it  seemed like he wanted to see how much he could ‚Äúdominate‚Äù me. And then slowly over the next hour he began to pick a fight with me that made me feel like grabbing my neck earlier was fueled by some level of rage deep down.

1elo8ll,Is this a warning sign? ,Due-Passenger-323,6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1elo8ll/is_this_a_warning_sign/,"Really wanted to come on here and get an outside opinion on this situation. I'm at a loss for what to think and I don't even know how to approach this. My boyfriend and his brother used to be really close. They both kind of raised each other so they definitely have a bond between them that no one else in the family has. Back in 2022 my boyfriend's brother (I'll call him Jay) got together with his first girlfriend. I guess in the beginning the relationship wasn't all that great. According to my boyfriend, Jay would confide in him about how his girlfriend was really controlling and jealous, to the point where he couldn't even say another woman's name without it being an issue. He even contemplated breaking up with her. Fast forward summer of 2024 and they've been together for 2 years now. In that time, Jay has slowly but surely begun to almost cut ties with the family, even my boyfriend whom he used to be so close to. 
   Jay doesn't hang out with his brother anymore, doesn't make time to play video games with him anymore, doesn't visit, doesn't really call, doesn't do anything. He always flakes on plans and seeing how much that hurts my boyfriend is really hard to stomach. Recently we drove to New York from Rhode Island to celebrate Jay's birthday and it was a complete disaster. Jay and his girlfriend pretty much spent the whole time fighting, and were extremely inconsiderate towards my boyfriend and I. They made us drive around New York city to an unknown destination for hours, just to never show up to the destination, and we had to drive another hour to meet up with them. My boyfriend and I really didn't want to start any drama, so we sucked it up so we can focus on Jay's birthday, but the whole trip was filled with them just being disrespectful,fighting and Jay apologizing as if the whole thing was his fault. Of course my boyfriend didn't want to stay quiet about the situation and tried to bring up his misgivings about what we witnessed and experienced during the trip to Jay, only for Jay to turn it around and say that WE were being rude and disrespectful, and that WE were the problem. It was honestly a huge slap in the face. 
  I'm trying to understand Jay's perspective and take accountability for how he thinks we wronged him, but honestly that's really hard to do when he won't even hold himself, nor his girlfriend accountable for how they treated us. Now, Jay hardly ever talks to my boyfriend, his brother and really, best friend. Blows him off at every opportunity. He's currently moving to a location outside of New York with his girlfriend (who is from New York) and wants nothing to do with us and his family cause apparently his girlfriend can't forgive us for how we treated her? Mind you, we are nothing but kind to this girl. I and the family will take responsibility for however we made her feel, or whatever we did to he, but she won't even give us the courtesy of talking to us to tell us what we did wrong. Meanwhile, Jay is slowly but surely cutting ties with the people he used to value.
   To add further context, my boyfriend wasn't the nicest to the girlfriend at first, especially after Jay would confide in him about how controlling she can be. Also, my boyfriend really didn't like how Jay acted like a completely different person when she was around. Plus, Jay hardly ever goes anywhere without his girlfriend which is another point of contention. After my boyfriend and I got together, and I talked to him about giving the girlfriend an honest chance, he changed his behavior for the better. But that wasn't enough I think. I know this situation is hurting my boyfriend in ways I can't understand, but I really don't know if there's anything I can do to help. Any advice?",2024-08-06 17:47:57,2025-03-17 16:06:18,signs

I spoke to one of the refuge workers here, and she told me it looks like my daughter is experiencing the after effects of witnessing and experiencing abuse.

I reported the child abuse to the police, and they refered the case to children's social care and now a strategy meeting and child protection case is going to be open. Aswell as a police investigation.

My daughter has also been refered for a child behaviour and mental health assessment.

I'm very confused.",whitney_likespeaches,17,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/m4r51m/ive_been_told_that_this_will_escalate_but_so_far/,"I am so confused and hurt right now. My boyfriend and I just got in the nastiest fight which elevated to him saying terrible things about my character (many curse words and degrading comments, he called me an a\*\*\*\*\*, sociopath, narcissist, psychopath, and abuser).

My boyfriend and I have been together for 1 yr. He recently had to quit law school due to worsening health problems. I have chronic health issues too, and we are both partially disabled. Since then, he's taken up an extremely bad habit of gaming 7-12 hours a day and is in a terrible deep depression. He's been doing this for *\*months\**. I love him, he's nice to me most of the time, but this drives me crazy. Most often, we are sweet and kind to each other, having a nice time, but once a month (or so), he burts angry explosive insults at me that leave me emotionally *destroyed* and thinking terrible things about myself/my character for *days.*

Most recent fight: I don't have a lot of money but I bought an expensive ($1800) computer to edit videos (which I'm not doing much anymore). I let him use it 95% of the time (since his old computer broke) for the past 6 months. Occasionally, I want to use it to watch movies or TV shows because my old computer sucks and has no memory. I only use the new comp a few hours per week; every other waking hour of the day, every day, he's on it.

I used my new comp to watch a TV show to decompress after working on a research proposal when he was asleep. Within 5 minutes of him waking up, he asked for my computer so he could play games. I was on the season finale and wanted to finish. He wanted me to quit midway & give it to him. He said it was ""unfair"" of me to give it to him since I'd used it for several hours (when he was sleeping). I said that it was ridiculous that he was tallying time I used MY computer when HE was ASLEEP.

I suggested he do something else for 30 minutes while I finish the season finale, and offered to let him use my old computer to do whatever. He said my old computer is a ""piece of c\*\*\*"" and it can't do ""what he *needs* to do"" (play games). I pointed out that he didn't *need* to play. He said my use of the word ""need"" (that he didn't *NEED* to play games) was manipulative +disgusting because I took this statement ""out of context"" and was trying to ""insult"" him. He said that I was a ""liar"" for ""twisting his words around"" - that saying you don't *need* to play video games is ""judgemental and manipulative"".

I said it's unfair that I never get to use the computer that *I* paid for with *my* money.

This is when he **COMPLETELY** lost it. Suddenly, because I brought ""money"" into the equation (only in the context of my computer, nothing else), he started yelling and screaming at me, hurling every insult he could think of: a ""financial abuser"", wielding ""power, money, and status"" to manipulate &control him, being a ""slithering slimy snake"". He said it was DISGUSTING of me to mention money, and I was using resources and privilege to abuse him in a ""sociopathic""/evil way. I was called a c\*\*\*, judgemental w\*\*\*\*, and that my actions come ""straight out of the book of psychopathy"". He said that I had intentionally hurt/insult him (I truly didn't intend to, I was stating what I thought was objective fact), and because of that, he admitted that he ""WANTED to HURT me with words and insults"". He said that unless I can ""admit"" to being a ""disgusting manipulative a\*\*\*\*\*\*"", then we are ""OVER"". If I didn't admit to it, then I was a ""liar"". So in other words, my only choices were to be a ""liar"" or an ""a\*\*\*\*\*\*"". Pinned into a corner, forced to admit to something I don't think I did. When I told him to stop fighting, that I cool down and stop verbally attacking me, he said ""this isn't over"". I told him I had a headache and went into the other room and he followed me, yelling at me, getting in my space.

I am now feeling extremely upset and wondering if I'm the ""bad guy"". He spent HOURS trying to convince me that I'm a psychological abuser, narcissist, liar, sociopath, and that I have MAJOR character problems/toxicity.. I'm starting to wonder if that's true. I've gone as far as watching youtube videos on psychopathy/sociopathy/financial abuse, trying to figure out if somehow he's right and I have been incredibly abusive somehow but completely unaware of my actions. I even offered to go to therapy to work on becoming ""more aware"" of my ""toxicity"" since I apparently am not understanding it. Right now, I'm 50% convinced that I'm a covert narcissist without ever knowing it. This is devastating to me. Because he attacks me like this so often, I've started recording our conversations and have been listening to them again trying to understand where I went wrong or how I lied. It's utterly confusing because in the recordings, I don't see what I did wrong, all I hear is him attacking me.

The next day, he apologized and said he didn't mean what he said (even though during the argument he said he meant it). But, he DOES still think I was a jerk for bringing up money. I told him that I am now extremely concerned about ""being a narcissist"", and to that, he responded that I have a ""weak sense of identity"", am ""overly sensitive"", and should stop bringing up water under the bridge. As far as he's concerned, that was ""normal"", he acts like nothing happened, and I AM the ""pathological one"" for not ""letting go of the fight"".

TL;DR: I am very concerned that I'm a covert narcissist without realizing it or that I'm toxic, as my boyfriend says many times during our fights. I don't understand how my behavior or comments are ""toxic"" but if I say one thing wrong that triggers him, he flips this anger switch and starts attacking me and assaulting my character, calling me a narcissist/sociopath/all sorts of terrible curse words. I'm confused beyond words and concerned that I've been a narcissist without realizing it. My head is spinning.

We've already had some marriage counseling, a short separation, and advice from my sister to leave him. We've seen a lot of progress in our relationship over the past two years, but I can't get over these incidences.

In the beginning, he once punched a hole in the wall, but I wasn't there for it. Later on, he punched a hole in the wall in front of me. He knew how upsetting this was for me due to my history of having a sometimes violent father. He apologized, we made up, progress, etc., etc. Next is when we got into a fight prior to an event that I refused to go to because of the fight. On the way home, as he was driving, he purposely swerved the car in the street (no cars nearby) and said it was because he was angry. I was absolutely inconsolable because I have a fear of getting into a car accident (which he knows) and made him switch with me so I could drive home. A few months back, he got so angry that he grabbed a wire basket (about the size of a small laundry basket), threw it against the dresser in front of me, then proceeded to pick it up and bang it against the floor until it was bent out of shape. I told him I was going to leave him after that. Eventually, we made up, but I told him if he ever did something like that again, it was over. We made progress! Our marriage has been going really well. Fast forward to tonight. We had been fighting for over an hour and I told him I was going to text someone about meeting up to talk about our argument because we needed a third party to help us come to a conclusion. I grabbed my phone. He reached over to take it from my hand because he didn't want me texting anyone about it. I hit him, hard (I admit because I was angry), twice in the forearm to get him to let go. He grabbed both of my wrists, hovered his body over mine (we were in bed), got close to my face and said, ""Don't EVER hit me like that again."" His face was red and he was so angry that through his words he got spit all over my face.

That last incident is what makes me question everything the most. He's never done anything like that before. Am I overreacting? I 100% haven't been the best wife. I've yelled, screamed, verbally abused him and put him down at times because it's an awful defense mechanism I have. I've said vile things to him before. Anyone who has been put down as much as he has surely would break at some point - but did he go too far? I feel like he wouldn't ever physically hurt me.

I love him more than anything - I know that he's hurt inside and he needs to heal, but is this abnormal? I feel like I have nothing to turn to. Everything I read online feels like it's too extreme to relate to my situation, yet I feel like this isn't normal. Am I the crazy one? He's not a violent person. These are extremely isolated incidents. He's not a monster and I know he's trying his best to make progress as a person.

Sorry for the long post. Thank you if you've read it all. I don't know what to think or believe and honestly I'm just very tired.",2024-04-25 03:14:28,2025-03-17 16:06:23,signs

157x05c,Concerned about my best friend's (28F) 12-year relationship with an unstable partner (30M) - Signs of toxicity and potential DV. How can I help her without damaging our friendship?,ivegot_brainrot,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/157x05c/concerned_about_my_best_friends_28f_12year/," My (28F) best friend has been with her (30m) boyfriend for 12 years, and I have serious concerns that the relationships is toxic, unhealthy and heading into DV territory. 

For context: 

They met when they were 17 and 19 respectively, and the relationship started off fine‚Ä¶ He has always had mental health issues (potentially bipolar), however I never suspected that the relationship was toxic due to this until around 5 years ago, when he became a lot more mentally unstable, cut off all of his friends and became completely reliant on her for all of his needs. There was a long period of time where he couldn‚Äôt hold down a job, as there was always something wrong with the boss. It was never him, the world was simply out to get him. Thankfully, he found a job he really enjoyed (a dive bar that allowed him to be himself, something that is crucial for his wellbeing) and found a crowd of friends through that job which meant that my bff could have some reprieve from having to be his only person. Unfortunately though, he was still showing toxic traits: ie - calling her every half an hour when she went out somewhere (even though they live together), speaking to her disrespectfully in public, having emotional outbursts at her, forcing her to leave parties early with him, and generally controlling/questionable behaviour. 

In the past, he‚Äôs also made passing comments about their sex life to me and other friends of my best friend, saying that ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt want his dick, and he could have a line of girls waiting to have his dick if they were to break up‚Äù, which is unhinged behaviour considering he was saying this to HER friends. 

He is unpleasant to be around, and many people find his personality overbearing, and people (especially my bff), has to walk on eggshells around him because he is susceptible to having emotional outbursts and socially inappropriate. To be completely honest, he is a loser and she is a literal goddess who could have anyone she wants. It breaks my heart because if you look at their relationship over the 12-year period, you can see how much she has changed, from being this incredibly confident, fiery girl who would always call out behaviour, to now having low self esteem, a loss of identity, and so much more introverted than how she used to be. Her light has gone out... I want to also mention an added complex layer to this: She lost her mum to brain cancer 3 years ago, and it so happened that her BF also lost his dad to cancer....a week apart. and in the same hospital, which created this trauma bond between them, and he always talks about how it must be fate that they are together, and have to remain together because of it. 

I am writing this because last night when I was hanging out with both of them, they had an argument which was triggered by his lack of social awareness when talking about someone he didn‚Äôt like like (a constant thing), which led to him storming off, telling my bff to fuck off and storming out of the bar to who knows where. Just really aggressive behaviour that makes me realise that the way he acts in public, is probably tenfold worse behind close doors. 

Note: My friend and I tried to imply that we didn‚Äôt think her relationship was healthy a few years ago during a one-on-one dinner with her, but she shut it down quickly/didn‚Äôt want to get into it. 

**TL;DR**: My best friend has been in a 12-year relationship with an unstable, mentally unhealthy partner. He shows toxic behaviour, calls her incessantly, and makes inappropriate comments. Recently, he had an aggressive outburst in public, raising concerns about what happens behind closed doors. I want to help her, but previous attempts to discuss it were shut down.

Obviously during dating times or even early marriage, things were hard financially but sweet. Then came the frequent job hoppings, he couldn‚Äôt secure a stable career for our family and didn‚Äôt allow me to work. But I had to cos well, we have to eat. 

I‚Äôm a freelancer, my jobs come in short 3-4 months contracts and require me to stay out for at least 12 hr shifts each time. He was never happy for me or my career and didn‚Äôt want me to go out to work or even go out without him. 

Fast forward 2 years, I just finished a major project and got pregnant with our second. This time he had established himself a career and with 2 kids, it‚Äôs almost impossible to go back to my old job. So I didn‚Äôt work for awhile. Again same, whenever I try to bring the kids to the park or museum, and I would inform him of our plans but it feels like I‚Äôm threading on eggshells cos he is unhappy that we are going out, not in a way where he feels left out but rather he says he will ‚Äúmiss us‚Äù. So I said ok fine, we will head out less, and when we‚Äôre home, he ignores us and just does his work. 

And when the kids are playing at home he throws a fit saying they are noisy and he can‚Äôt think (for his work). So obviously this has a very bad effect on our kids especially my elder child. Now she feels like she is threading on eggshells every time she plays with her sister cos daddy is working. And I see how this whole thing is affecting her negatively. She shouldn‚Äôt have to feel like that while playing at home. 

So fast forward again to now, where I‚Äôm starting my own business to try and be independent and accrue some savings, cos even though he pays for bills and food and everything, he doesn‚Äôt give me money. Again, with my business when I tell him I need to go out to meet a client or do some supplier sourcing he isn‚Äôt happy with me stepping out of the house. 

For 6 years now, every time I have activities outside the house, be it my own drs appointment, visiting my mum, work meetings alr play dates I get scared informing him of my plans. I have tried not informing him and of cos that makes it worse.  

I‚Äôm hiding in the bathroom typing this after putting the kids for bedtime and even so, he texted me to ask me what am I doing and where I am.

Have you ever been in a relationship with an abuser who changed their ways? If yes, what influenced that change? If not, what was a clear sign for you to call it quits?

How do you get an abuser out of your house? (I solely own my house)

Backstory: My (F26) boyfriend (M27) and I have been together for over a year now and we both live in my house. He grew up in an abusive household with alcoholic parents. He has carried many issues from his upbringing into his own life. He drinks alcohol daily. He has anger problems. I have always tried to be understanding knowing what his childhood was like and knowing that he suffers from depression. Things started to get violent last summer. It is not a daily occurrence, maybe once every few months we get into what I would consider a brawl. I keep giving him chances to change because I have known him since middle school and the good side of him is my best friend.

Last night was the latest episode resulting in me getting punched in the face and one of my vases being thrown down the stairs shattering everywhere. This was preceded by me waking up at 4:30 am to use the bathroom and smelling cigarette smoke. He knows I dont allow smoking in my house or my car. I went downstairs to confront him and it escalated from there. I could not have an adult conversation with him. First he tried lying (there was a beer can covered in ashes on the table so obviously he was smoking inside).  I called him out on his bs and how this has happened multiple times and he is disrespecting me and my property that I work hard for. He also knows I have asthma. 

He ended up yelling at me to shut up and going upstairs. I continued to confront him in our room and told him between this disrespect and the constant lying (caught him on chat sites numerous times talking to other women), and his drinking, that I was done. He proceeded to tell me he would ‚Äúbury me in the basement‚Äù and refused to leave. The physical fighting started after he took my vase and threatened to break it, I tried taking it back and it went from there. 

Every time this happens he begs for forgiveness stating I made him mad and him hitting me was an accident. The next day he acts like nothing happened. He said he would stop drinking, but I have serious doubts. 

Other things he has threatened me with but then says he wasnt being serious and was just mad: setting my house on fire with me inside, setting my car on fire, breaking anything he can get his hands on. 

I dont want to get him arrested and him lose his job and he has also threatened me with CPS. I take great care of my child, but we live in a state where recreational cannabis is legal and I do partake. I dont know what if anything would happen, but he uses that against me if I threaten to file a police report. My child was not home to witness this episode.",2021-03-12 14:20:31,2025-03-17 16:06:37,signs
vrtez9,(35F) Feeling guilt/unsure after confronting husband (45M) about abuse warning signs,throwaway_break_,9,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/vrtez9/35f_feeling_guiltunsure_after_confronting_husband/,"TW: Potential child endangerment, potential emotional abuse

&#x200B;

My husband and I dated for about 7 years and have been married for two years.

We have a 2.5 month old baby.

The tldr: He's been showing more and more warning signs of domestic abuse, and emotional abuse. I asked him to get relationship counseling and he's blaming me, saying I'm overreacting, and implying I've ruined our relationship.  


The story: 

He has begun showing various warning signs of abuse, which I'll list later.  
He has never actually hurt me or the baby, but during a fight, he held our baby upside down by the ankles. He won't apologize for this or promise not to do it again. 

I told this to a counselor I'm seeing, and she reported it to CPS. 

I told husband we have an unhealthy relationship, that I'm half-way decided to separate for the baby's safety, and that we need relationship counseling. I did not use the term ""abuse"" or explain that what he's been doing are warnings signs for abuse. I did not share that we've been reported to CPS.

He responded saying that I'm overreacting, this is my fault, that I hurt him, and that ""I thought we were special. I don't feel that way any more.""

I feel like I have ruined our marriage and maybe I really have overreacted. It hurts so much to consider leaving. But I love our baby the most and I want to make sure she grows up safe. I don't want her to see an unhealthy model for relationships.

Am I overreacting? Isn't it better to be safe than sorry when a baby/child is involved?

Summary of the recent warning signs:

\- He threw some cushions around the house in anger during a fight. (Intimidation)

\- Holding the baby upside down by the ankles is the biggest one, which pushed me over the edge to seeking help/taking action. It was during a big argument, but he seemed calm when he did it. The baby was not upset or hurt. He has never done it before, and the fact that he did it during our fight makes me think it was done to feel powerful and in control.  (Intimidating you through threatening looks or actions.)

\- He insists he was ""just playing"" when he held the baby upside down. When I ask him not to do it again, he says I'm overreacting, that he doesn't agree that it's not safe. He refuses to read literature, or listen to our pediatrician, which say it's not safe to do that with a newborn. He says I have a problem being overprotective and too strict with him. (Minimizing, blaming)

\- When I asked him not to hold our newborn upside down, he started saying that I'm mentally incompetent, that I'm not safe for the baby, implying he would take the baby away. He said ""go write a book report about how you're mentally incompetent"", making fun of my habit of reading a lot and sharing research/info with him. (threatening to take the children away, making her think she's crazy)

\- He is increasingly critical of me. (Telling you that you never do anything right.)

\- He dislikes my sister and has been criticizing her. She is visiting, and he is saying he will not have her visit again. When I ask him to stop/change behaviors, he says ""Is this because you talked to your sister?"" Saying she is a bad influence on our relationship. (Isolation)

\- Three times when I tried to make a minor purchase (under 20$), he blocked it, saying ""We need to save"", when he will spend money on similar value items without asking my permission. (Controlling finances in the household without discussion)

\- Repeatedly, when I say ""I felt hurt/sad when I heard you say/do X"", he responds that I'm being disrespectful, that I'm attacking him, and that I'm not listening to him. My original statement of what he did is never addressed, and I end up apologizing to him for being hurtful. (Minimizing, blaming)

\- When I said I was going to adjust our water heater so the max temperature is lower, for the baby's safety, he said he was ""fully against you touching the water heater"", that I wasn't listening to him, that I shouldn't make decisions without him. (Controlling)

\- When I asked that we get relationship counseling he said that the problem is that I am too insistent on getting my way all the time, and that I'm too overprotective of the baby. (Minimizing, blaming)

\- Also in response to my request that we get relationship counseling, he asked if I want to be a single parent, saying I'm acting like I want a divorce. (Threatening to leave)

\- I told him that my counselor said our relationship is unhealthy, and that she said the problem is not me or my communication. He said that I broke trust by sharing info with her about our relationship, that it was like ""an emotional affair"" to talk to her about my life. He said she doesn't have context or know the tone I use and her opinion is invalid. (Isolation, minmizing, blaming)

\- Weirdest of all; during an argument, he physically pushed me down to give him a BJ. I said I didn't feel comfortable because we were not in a good place emotionally. He said ""I know - that's why I need this."" I went along with it, and after we finished he resumed arguing with me. (Sexual coercion?)

Some older things that give context:

\- When we got engaged, he convinced me to promise to never talk to anyone about our relationship or fights, ever. (Isolation)

\- Also he convinced me to promise, (which I now regret and told him I won't follow), that I'd let him make the final call on all decisions in our marriage. (Controlling)

&#x200B;

More context:

\- He's always been a bit controlling but I had not minded. 

I'm pretty easy going. He decides what we watch on TV, often what we eat, sometimes what I wear, and handles the budget. With furnishing/remodeling our home, it's been his project, and he asks me for advice/approval, but really the house is his style, not mine, but I don't mind. He has good taste.

\- He's shown a pattern of disregarding safety with the baby since she was born, and I have pushed him to be more careful. To sum up - he wasn't following the safety guidelines for sleep and for how long to keep formula after mixing it up at room temperature. I protected the baby as much as I could by caring for her \~20 hours a day, meaning I got little/no sleep, didn't shower, etc, and after about a month convinced/pushed him to where he does now follow those safety guidelines for feeding and sleep. But he seems resentful that I pushed/convinced him about these things.",2022-07-05 08:54:05,2025-03-17 16:06:39,signs

Nearly 2 months or 60 days later the defendant hasn't done either. If they had it would have been recorded on the courts website, like everything else filed regarding the case.

The signs I've been getting that he ***MAY*** hit me are really scary when they happen. We'll be in a little argument (most the damn time, there doesn't even NEED to be an argument, it's like he gets off on getting upset with me) and he will grab my entire face, start shaking my head and say, *""I'm about ready to throw you through the wall.""* or *""If you don't shut the fuck up, I ***WILL FUCKING HURT YOU***!""* It is so scary and uncomfortable when he shakes my head like that. I also want to add that this **only** used to happen while he was drinking, but it has graduated to just happening every single time we get into a fight, even if the fight is tiny. And speaking of that... This man will get upset/angry/fly off his rocker over the **SMALLEST** things. For instance, he will get ***OFF THE WALL*** ANGRY if I do small things like: spill some water, lay on him the wrong way, (by this I mean, maybe I accidentally knicked him in the jaw while trying to cuddle) the other day he was doing a ""live"" Instagram video, I called while he was doing it, having ***NO CLUE*** what he was doing, and he literally almost broke up with me over it. It'll be ***TINY*** things like that that end up with us in a fight, that end up with him nearly hitting me... I have been in three (now four) **VERY** bad abusive relationships, and unfortunately, I have only been in ONE relationship that wasn't abusive either physically or mentally... it's sad the way that works. Anyways, maybe I just need some words of encouragement, I'm not sure. I came here for a reason, I'm just not sure what that reason is...

I'm looking at ~50 days left on my lease with my abuser boyfriend and the apt is open on the 3rd. I want to escape so badly but he thinks were going to sign on a new place together (even though he tells me know much he hates me and doesn't want to be with me, fucking bdp).. 

Please help me overcome my guilt and move forward with signing tomorrow. I feel like I'm going to trigger his BPD by moving out silently and secretively but I also know it's the safest way for me to escape. I'm so scared for my family and myself..

It's stupid but I need validation right now..any advice and encouragement to keep walking this path of freedom would be loved..",2019-12-13 05:12:15,2025-03-17 16:06:44,signs
sg7koy,I missed the signs of abuse,Ok_Extension2021,6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/sg7koy/i_missed_the_signs_of_abuse/,"TW physical abuse - I had a physically abusive childhood. My father would get angry over everything and then physically abuse me and my sister. His weapon of choice was usually the belt but could be anything. I remember one time when I was around 8 years old and he was frustrated fixing something. He asked me to hand him a wrench and then hit me over the head with the tool because it wasn't a wrench. Like an 8 year old girl knows what a wrench is? He took out his anger on his children.

I survived my father's abuse and swore I would never be with an abusive man. I didn't realize that abuse comes in other forms too. I ended up with a sneaky abuser. A man that used more subtle ways to abuse me. Because it wasn't physical, I didn't realize it was abuse.

My abuser wasn't an educated man. He didn't have a high intelligence level. But this man had an advanced knowledge of hidden psychological abuse that was at a genious level.

Hindsight is 20/20 but I can't believe that I wasn't able to see the signs. He was sexually coercive and would throw tantrums until I stopped saying no and gave in. I would just lay there and let him use my body. Why didn't I see that as abusive?

He had me convinced that my memory was bad. He would rewrite history and then tell me he was worried about me because I didn't remember how it happened. It wasn't until I started rereading his texts and emails that I realized that he was gaslighting me.

I gave up all my friends and family when I was with him. I don't even know how that happened other than if I were mad about something they did, he would ""support"" me until they weren't in my life anymore. At other times he would just point out the negative in people until I stopped wanting to be around them.

There were a lot of openly abusive things he did early in the relationship but learned after counseling to use more mind games. He used to block me from leaving, break things, punch holes in the wall, threaten to damage my vehicle - things that were proof of his controlling nature. He graduated to using hard to prove things like implied threats, he'd force an arguemnt when my blood pressure was already high (he knows I have hard to manage hypertension), during the split he'd tell me that his lawyer said (and try to terrorize me with scary legal threats), or tell me how his therapist said (whatever he wanted to be right about that day, I don't even think he saw a therapist).

I'm afraid to trust my own judgement anymore. What I thought was love, was actually control. How can I avoid ending up in another abusive relationship or the opposite and never trusting anyone again?",2022-01-30 11:47:15,2025-03-17 16:06:45,signs
hhqcqm,Early Signs of Domestic Violence? Ex-Partner,Yuki_no_Ookami,21,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/hhqcqm/early_signs_of_domestic_violence_expartner/,"So first of all, I am safe right now. I have been separated for months, blocked him everywhere and he seems to have finally given up. 

However, something that has been bothering me for a while are some very subtle signs. I have the feeling that my relationship progressed very slowly compared to others and he was very careful with how he pushed boundaries, tested and then drew back and waited. 

He hit me once, early on, which was during sex and he claimed he had  been afraid I'd bite him during oral and it had just been a reflex. It was more of a slap, it didn't hurt, I was more shocked than anything. This did not happen again, he apologized. (Still, why would I suddenly bite him?)

We always had arguments regularly, or more him telling me what he disliked about me. They got louder, more frequent and he sometimes would say I deserved punishment for being the way I was, or I deserved to be hit, yet he wouldn't do it, things like that. One day, I wasn't there and he was angry at me, he called me to say he had to let off steam and attacked my suitcase and he didn't know if it was broken or not. This made me very afraid what would have happened, had I been there. Yet, I returned. Suitcase looked as if nothing had happened tbh but it left a certain impression. He also slammed his fist on the table once or twice later in the relationship. 

He would try and push sexual boundaries as well, very slowly and while early on focusing on my pleasure, stop doing the things I liked slowly and then ignore obvious discomfort or demand I change my attitude eventually. 

He would also for some reason, despite me telling him I hated having my neck and throat touched, ask to touch it. To caress it, and later to lightly choke it (never that it hurt or cut off air). He would simply say ""I want to choke you"". He then promised it wouldn't hurt and was totally harmless, but I can't shake off the feeling that this was to get me used to that kind of thing. He would also start tickling me, start pillow fights when I was clearly not in the mood and very tired and ready to go to bed. Like  he could tell the timing wasn't good. 

Now, all of this happened over a 5 year period. And none of this probably would have counted as evidence. But I can't shake off the feeling that this was going to escalate. It would take probably months or years, but I am just incredibly certain at some point he would have hit me again. At some days, when he looked at me it just was a look full of hate. Sometimes I just felt very sure that if I stayed, I would end up being killed. That he was able to do that or would be at some point. I feel like the testing of boundaries, shifting of tone, level of aggression so subtly increased I almost didn't notice. 

Was I just being paranoid, or did my gut know things that hadn't made it to my brain yet?",2020-06-29 01:04:15,2025-03-17 16:06:46,signs

I‚Äôve been married a year and a half and we knew each other for only a year before that. 

We have a seven month old baby. 

He has pushed me EXTREMELY hard where I go flying three times- once because I walked towards him angry, once because I pushed him, and the second time because I punched his arm. 

I know I can‚Äôt put my hands on him, but it‚Äôs worth noting that both times I did, I screamed multiple times for him to let me leave and he was physically stopping me. I was trying to leave bc I knew I was too angry. 

However, he threw me into a bed the first two times, but this last time he threw me into the couch where my spine violently hit a hard edge where our center console area is to hold items and drinks. 

It‚Äôs been a week and i can still barely move my neck and am in a ton of pain. He also busted my lip open when he pulled me tight in some kind of mma hold. 

He threw my and then pinned me and squeezed my arms only two months ago and I was scared he‚Äôd hurt me worse, and he already has. I believe he choked me both times but it happened so fast and he denies it, but both times he ends up holding me VERY tight and I can‚Äôt breathe for 5+ seconds. I was bruised for a couple weeks when he grabbed my arms, too. 

I‚Äôm scared for my life. Please give me advice.",2022-01-27 02:48:26,2025-03-17 16:06:47,signs

One of the things were that he would like to randomly ‚Äúfake wrestle‚Äù me. He would push me in the bed and wrestle with me, all in good fun.

I would tell him to stop and that I couldn‚Äôt breathe, but he wouldn‚Äôt do it right away.

How can someone how claimed to love me do the things that he did. Here‚Äôs what I put up with for almost our whole relationship: 

- The yelling. If anything went wrong in his life (for example, losing his wallet) he would get so angry and loud, he didn‚Äôt care who heard him. It would scare me so much I would hide in my room. A lot of times I felt I was to blame. 

- Destroying property. Whenever he would get angry he would punch, break, rip, anything that was mine or close to me. (Examples: he punched my hydroflask  bottle on the table and left a dent in it, tore a cushion off the couch that was attached.) 

- Jokes about hurting me. This didn‚Äôt start happening until about the last year but he would joke about hitting me or act like he was going to hit me and then laugh about it like it was a joke. I repeatedly told him that I didn‚Äôt like it but he would do it anyway 

- Guilting me into having sex. Whenever he wanted it he would always expect that I did too, even though I wasn‚Äôt in the mood. I would have to tell him no several times before he‚Äôd stop asking. Sometimes I would just give in 

- Passive aggressive comments. He would sometimes say mean things to get a reaction out of me or to get what he wanted. He would target things that I was most vulnerable about. 

It was so hard to believe that I was being abused and to admit that it was domestic violence because these things didn‚Äôt happen all the time. We had a lot of happy times. But I‚Äôm so glad I woke up because things could‚Äôve gotten worse. It was so hard to leave this relationship and it took a lot of therapy but I‚Äôm glad I did it. I‚Äôm posting this because these are the signs that I took for granted. These are things I thought were normal for a relationship, that this was a normal way for men to react to things.

kuwui4,I sign my lease tomorrow,aljc6712,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/kuwui4/i_sign_my_lease_tomorrow/,"A year ago I decided to leave a toxic, emotionally abusive relationship of 7 years with my 7 year old daughter. 

I left one bad relationship because I was desperate to escape and blinded by the soon-to-be worse situation. 

A coworker convinced me to leave, I was love bombed and fell for it in my vulnerable state. The initial breakup was horrible and I had everything I owned stolen from me by my ex partially due to the new guy pressuring me to ""choose"" because I would return home where my ex still lived, though we had broken up, neither of us had means to completely separate immediately. 

Because I essentially had nothing, I became dependant on the new guy for means of a functional home, this all happened a couple weeks before the pandemic hit our country and province went into full blown lock down. The provinces closed up borders, which separated me even more from my support system, my family lived a mere two minute drive away... Just outside the border

There were red flags from the start, but I was so isolated due to my job being on the opposite side of the border, the country in panic, the province closed everything down, having very little possessions, I grinned and bared whatever hoping that it'll get better.

Turns out that he's a major alcoholic. Withdrawal syndrome if he hasn't drank in 14 hours, shakes, nausea, panic attacks, etc. 
About 4 months in, I tried to explain how out of control his drinking was, and that set off a bomb, he flipped the couch I was sitting on, so I hit the wall it was pushed up against, a blanket underneath me, he yanked out, so I again hit the floor, while curled up he threw large clay flower pots at me. My daughter waking up and seeing this. 

I try to tuck her back in, doing my best to keep her out of his sight because I wasn't sure what he was like, this was the first I experienced. 

She wouldn't let me leave her alone, she was scared, but I knew I had to because I was the target and she wasn't safe near me. 

However I held her as she trumble beneath me, I had her lie down with her face into the bed, worried if he heard her crying, it would draw attention to her. 

It lasted hours, several things broken. 

Since then, there was at least 4 other violent incidents. Each time, I disassociated quicker, not giving him the reaction he wanted, he pushed further. I started to record the audio, I took pictures of the bruises or damage. 

The worst incident though, he just broke his toe from kicking the door, thinking I left it cracked when I walked away from him trying to fight.

A problem I always had was the backdoor had a two way deadbolt lock, so only he could unlock it. My daughter's bedroom closest to that door, if there was a fire that prevented her from reaching the front door, she would be trapped. 
He knew that was an anxiety for me, so after breaking his toe, standing in the hallway between my daughter's room and the front door where I was, he lights a rubber table runner on fire, throws it to the ground, basically threatening my kid's life.

She woke up at the same time, so he immediately snuffed out the fire, and stopped. 

I walked outside knowing he wouldn't continue to fight where neighbors would definitely see. 
He locks me out and says now, he's really going to burn the place down. I calmly say ""I'm calling 911."" 
Obviously, opens the door, goes to bed all innocently like I imagined it all. 

Since being violent didn't work, he began routinely calling the cops on me, trying to give them the impression that if I were to go to the cops with my evidence, he appears like the calm one, as if trying to beat me to it. He probably called the cops on me 8 times in the last 6 months. 

The last few times, they told me essentially they know his mental state has gone downhill and that I never did anything. 

All this long post to say, after months of trying to leave, I sign my lease for a place tomorrow. 

I can't afford rent, utility hookup, damage deposit, as well as living room furniture, dressers, bed frames, dishes, etc, and I'm terrified of not being able to get a functional home for my kid, but I'm going to try.",2021-01-11 06:15:07,2025-03-17 16:07:55,signs
ccetke,Are these early warning signs of abuse?,throwaway001today,8,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ccetke/are_these_early_warning_signs_of_abuse/,"Regular user going anon. I just need some perspective from others who might know the early warning signs.

My partner and I have been together for about three years. This person is the sweetest, most sensitive, loving person I have ever been involved with. But, from the beginning it was very apparent that they also have a side to them that is very prickly. Can never, ever be wrong, argumentative and aggressive. This has affected their job many times and also made friendships very difficult because of my partners moodiness. For a very long time, none of this ever affected me. My partner has always been just incredible. So warm, loving, gentle. 

But that is slowly changing and I am seeing it more and more. Lately, my partner is becoming-for lack of a better word- an asshole. Not all the time, but sometimes. He is more prone to snap at me and he is starting to use language with me he never used before. I am not the easiest person to live with and I know that, but there are signs here I would be a fool to ignore. Like I said, they have anger issues and it affects pretty much every other aspect of their life but it has never affected our relationship until now. The main red flags are lately when my partner is angry, he will clench his fists. He will curse and it's a tantrum. I don't feel comfortable bringing him around family or friends, because he just can't keep his mouth shut or let things go. And I think of all this and I think: 'red flag, red flag!"" but then I think of the warm, loving side and I think I am being way dramatic and maybe just imagining all this. The good has far outweighed the bad for so long but I feel like lately that is shifting. I just I guess need some advice. Thank you",2019-07-12 18:41:14,2025-03-17 16:07:56,signs

Last October, it was really bad and I was paralyzed and scared, and he suddenly got a bolt of reality and realized there was a 97% chance of me leaving and he realized he was the problem and after I left, he'd still be stuck with him as the problem, so he straightened up and stopped being abusive. He started up with therapy a few months ago at my urging, in particular that he address the avoiding sex that has been going on for years. 

Last night, things have been going well, so I brought up the sex subject (therapy appointment scheduled for the next day, today, and 99.9% sure he has not talked about it to therapist) and he, 32, said he's never going to change, that's just how he is, and I said honestly I'd been waiting 7 years, occasionally bringing it up as an area of major concern, and he blows up, then I wait and hope for awhile longer. And I can't. He needs to address this with therapy. Fortunately his therapist has been very good on unraveling the abuse and its causes. 

I realized something as we argued: first, that his claim that I resent him was actually projection - signs that he was feeling resentment and likely something underneath that. He started talking about the miscarriages I had and how I blamed him for us being childless, and I said, well, in all honesty, we both know you withheld sex a LOT. He brought up our being childless, resentment, and his verbal abuse and claimed that I had all those three things connected to sex, and I said honestly, sex is separate from those things. I'm just here talking about sex. I realized that while he claimed I resented him, he was actually deep in resentment and those three things were interwoven for him. 

He started saying stuff like he never loved me (or hinting it) and that he was just so insecure and he resented our age difference. I asked if he meant a different word from resentment and he said yes, but didn't know what it was. 

I realized that abusers really have terrible self esteems and allow themselves to choose the low road, to make terrible choices, and that's why they don't do the right and noble thing. they just are sick of themselves. (I was terribly abused by my family). They have no hero within that makes them make a good choice and stick up for what is right. He's lying to himself, and me. and heading down a bad path.

I'm scared, as he's showing bad signs, hoping therapy will help him today, really scared that I will feel trapped and desperate as I don't know where to go right now.",2019-05-16 19:51:14,2025-03-17 16:07:59,signs

I was in an abusive relationship (physical, emotional, psychological, and abusive) prior to dating this new man so I was hesitant to start dating again. This new man and I had sex and he came inside. After we had sex, it wasn't awkward at all, in fact he made me realize what and how sex should feel like. We talked and cuddled all night but a week later he became distant. I didn't understand how he was able to open up to me that deeply and walk away as if it was nothing. Back to the topic, I got an IUD back in 2015, but apparently it expired. I realized I was pregnant when I kept getting symptoms so I took 8 tests; one was negative the other were positive. When I told him the news, he broke down crying as so did I because I'm not ready to become a mother. Ultimately, I decided to end it.

I came over on the weekend to talk about plans. All of a sudden, he tells me he bought a test to see if it's really true. I got completely furious as I did not come over to be interrogated.  He starts calling me a liar, claiming that I only faked this to see him when I have a bunch of other situations going on; the last thing I wanted was to get pregnant. Keep in mind, this man already has a child from a previous marriage/relationship so you would think he learned his lesson. I already knew what my plans were and I didn't need a man to tell me 18-20 times to end it as it was already a difficult situation in itself. He starts yelling and telling me to pee on the pregnancy test. It doesn't take a genius to figure out if he is okay with yelling, ridiculing, and insulting my character then it would not be surprising if he wanted me to pee in front of him or put a camera in his bathroom to see if it's really true. It's a cycle of him not taking ownership/responsibility that it's not his child, paying support, etc. I felt as if he treated me like an animal yelling me to pee on a stick. This is what they do in prison or terrorists, forcing them to drop their pants, pee in front of them or bend over, cough and see if anything is stuck in there. Emotions were high and there was a lot of yelling, screaming and I felt as if I was a rape victim again. I haven't had that feeling for years and the feeling seemed as fresh as it happened yesterday. I remember when people doubted my story, authorities shaming and blaming me, friends and family disbelieving me to the extent where I fell into a deep depression. Additionally, this behavior of his made me view him in a different light and I couldn't see him the same way anymore. Yelling, ridiculing, insulting and insinuating demanding I pee in front of him made me feel like less of a person. Is this emotional abuse?  Am I wrong to think this?

I came over because she wasnt answering her texts, so I had to make sure she was ok. He could just be overly protective, but i‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm tail spinning here. 

She‚Äôs done before in the past, too. Not answering her texts. But every time she would always apologize and things would be fine again until the next period of being off the grid. 

He asked if she knew that i was here. I said no, right off the bat,  but i was about to explain myself that I was concerned for her but he cut me off and told me to leave. 


There‚Äôs also this photo i have here of a time when he had a supposed breakdown and trashed everything in their house. Broke plates, glasses, anything you can think of. She helped clean it up. When she sent me the photo, she downplayed it a lot. 


This what she wrote. 


‚ÄúHey, I uhm, had to do a lot of cleaning yesterday so I'm sorry I didn't text you back. My brother had a breakdown or something out of the blue, idk I just didn't see it coming‚Äù

Hi subreddit, fortunately this is my first time posting on here and honestly i‚Äôm not sure if i‚Äôve used the right flair tag. 

To explain the situation, i‚Äôve never been in a DA relationship before, and i am wondering if anyone knows any early signs. 
I recently brought up to my bf that i‚Äôm worried about him voting for a far-right political party (reformuk) and it did not go well. 
He doesn‚Äôt use reddit and won‚Äôt see this but i still don‚Äôt want to say too much. 
Basically he got very angry and upset and said the cliche ‚Äòso you think i‚Äôm an awful person‚Äô etc and told me i shouldn‚Äôt be upset about it. 
He also threw something at me however it was to make a point, not to hurt me in any way, what he threw couldn‚Äôt have hurt me and didn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt want to say what because it‚Äôs somewhat personal. 

Conclusion: should i be worried? we‚Äôve been together a few months and he‚Äôs lovely to me normally, but holds conservative views that don‚Äôt align with mine as a queer woman, we‚Äôre also only 20 so i‚Äôm unsure atm what to do

We have had an excellent partnership in most aspects of life and have been each other's biggest cheerleader and support system.. but recently what started as a simple conversation snowballed into an argument and we both kept saying triggering things to each other.. at one point when he made a particularly aloof comment I lost my cool and used cuss words.. within seconds he slapped me multiple times across my face and when I hit him back on his face once, he manhandled me in a violent manner as he continued to hit me.. I was left with multiple bruises and a red eye and bleeding nose.. he's never done this before but it has left me with major PTSD.. I'm unable to sleep or be normal.. i wake up multiple times at night and small noises scare me.. I'm inclined to lodge a complaint against him because i have the medical report from that night when I had to go to a hospital.. but everyone at home are discouraging me and repeatedly asking me to consider my marriage of 10 years and my child's future.. even if I don't lodge a complaint I am not certain if I can continue to live with him but these 10 yrs of marriage has seen me truly grow and progress with his support and there was genuine love... I am well educated and can stand up for myself but hesitant about which direction to go.. I'm unsure of what to do next.. would love an unbiased and sensible perspective on this.. p.s: I am financially backed decently and not dependent on him for much.. but we did have a decent run for a decade until it wasn't the case.. so I have some hesitancy in making a decision..

Edit: To those asking how he's been since the assault.. he has not showed any open remorse.. my family quickly got involved and when they asked him why he hit me he said i provoked and triggered him so he did it... But he's told a couple of people individually that he shouldn't have done it and he's not justifying it.. but it's been more than 4 days since the incident and he's yet to show any sign of guilt.. I said I wouldn't stay a moment in a house with him so he's left for another city for a week.. but the fact that he didn't bother to even check on my injuries or he didn't flinch when he had to leave our child behind before he packed his bag and left to get some ""space"" and clear his head is looming as the biggest reason why I'm considering leaving this relationship.. some people love only themselves and they are incapable of being part of a family I guess ..",2024-11-18 18:36:49,2025-03-17 16:08:09,signs

My husband hit me while I was 9 months pregnant, weeks before my due date. I ended up in triage with erratic contractions caused by the trauma to my stomach. Luckily, the contractions calmed down but I still delivered earlier than expected. My placenta had signs of damage not typical for delivering at 38 weeks. Nurse said it looked like post 40 weeks and the placenta was essentially dying. Can't help but think the trauma caused the damage and the early labor. I didn't allow him to be in the delivery room and asked him to move out. This lasted about a month. He eventually moved back in and is in the guest room helping me take care of the kids.

Baby is now 3 months old. He started therapy, is apologetic, and seems willing to change. Some of his old habits that bothered me before are still present. He wants to be better. The truth is, I'm stressed out that he's around, but I'm exhausted without the help. I want to believe that he is working to be better for us. Is what he did forgivable? Should I try to make this relationship work? He was my best friend before this event and I never thought he could hurt me like this or put our baby in danger. I'm just really conflicted. I don't want to stay if there's a chance he could hurt us again. But people do make mistakes, do I give him this chance to be better?

Edit: Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond. I have a lot to think about. I know, in my heart and mind, what he did was unforgivable. I shouldn't justify his actions. We never argued in front of our toddler and tensions were high throughout the pregnancy. His anger came from me wanting him to do more around the house. I never wanted to be a nagging wife. Now that he's doing more around the house, it felt wrong. Like this effort he's putting in is spoiled. 
I fantasized about this version of my husband being present for our family for so long. I just wanted it to be true. I feel like such a hypocrite, because I would have told someone to leave given these circumstances, then why can't I do the same for myself?
We started couples counseling. In therapy, the goal is to repair a relationship. The conflict, in part, stems from these sessions. Part of me wants to be angry, but we're given all these tools to regulate our feelings, to tell us that anger is meant to be processed and fought. That it's primal and not useful. The hardest battle is this internal banter with myself.",2024-07-09 03:43:03,2025-03-17 16:08:20,signs

At the first court date, his lawyer told my lawyer that if he was served a full protection order, he may lose his job. They told him they would fight a protection order, but would sign a restraining order. Me, being afraid of retaliation if he were to lose his job, said we can work with that if they can get me removed from the lease (I had to flee the state due to the situation). The full protective order would have removed me from lease liability. His mom is the co-signer, but me and him are on the lease. 

So the court date got moved up a month (it is next week), and I still don‚Äôt know what the restraining order will say. I regret falling for their trick, and am worried that if I decided to pursue the full protective order now that I may not win it because I moved to another state and because it has been a month. The cops refused to do any investigation, and I‚Äôve been told that it‚Äôs all kind of based on what the judge feels in the moment and not evidence anyway. I have the police report on its way but I don‚Äôt know if it will be here before the court date. He has already started seeing another woman, which I think may look like he wouldn‚Äôt try to find me but I‚Äôm still afraid for my safety. 

I‚Äôve decided to show up at this court date in person instead of via zoom so that the judge will see that I am serious, because I want to fight for the full protective order if the restraining order doesn‚Äôt state what I want it to. My lawyer hardly responds (he is a DV lawyer that is super busy), and doesn‚Äôt seem like he wants to fight them. Should I just settle for the restraining order? He has said it would be similar to a protective order, but I know it doesn‚Äôt hold the same weight legally. I also feel this weird guilt like it‚Äôs my duty to file for a full protective order, to try to warn anyone who looks at him in depth about his abusive tendencies.

Things got so bad that I was hospitalized at times, but I kept going back for all the complicated reasons that many of you here probably understand.

When I first heard about It Ends With Us, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to watch it. The thought of rehashing all that pain was too much, even though I had hoped the movie might really shine a light on the realities of abuse, like why people stay or go back, and maybe even help others understand instead of falling into victim blaming.

When it popped up on Netflix, I finally decided to give it a try but could only handle it in small chunks, of 15-20 minutes at a time over two days. I wanted to be brave and face it, but I was scared it would hit too close to home and bring back all the pain I‚Äôve worked so hard to heal from.

Honestly, I was so frustrated and disappointed. As a survivor, it felt like the movie watered down the reality of abuse, making it seem like all it takes is getting hit a few times and then just walking away. It completely ignored how manipulative, dangerous, and deeply complex these situations really are. It didn‚Äôt show the mental toll, the brainwashing, or the very real risks that victims face. This fairytale version abuse does nothing to educate people on the warning signs and reality of abuse or accurately represents the profile or level of narcissism present in real life abusers. It left me feeling even more misunderstood and isolated instead of validated.

Has anyone else felt hesitant to watch it? If you did see it, did you feel the same way, or was your experience different?


TLDR: I finally watched It Ends With Us but felt like it downplayed the complexity and danger of abusive relationships. It made leaving seem way too easy and missed a chance to educate people about the realities survivors face. Anyone else feel this way?",2024-12-15 00:35:53,2025-03-17 16:08:35,signs

I was using the oura ring and my cycle switched up bc I started taking vitex to make my periods less painful. He had taken me engagement ring shopping a month and a half prior, but we had issues after that bc I found someone else's hot pink glitter eyeshadow all over his sink and a blue rhinestone. I ended up miscarrying and found out he was involved with other women. He blocked me on everything without closure, refuses to return my belongings, has been spreading a smear campaign, and causing a lot of issues. I have become very ill from the stress and had to send him a cease and desist.

After he took me ring shopping, I found glitter and a rhinestone in his sink. When I asked if it belonged to his roommate‚Äôs girlfriend, the roommate said it didn‚Äôt. B then tried to stop me from leaving, begging me not to go. Later, he started picking fights, saying he couldn‚Äôt get over the fact that I almost left (even though I was just trying to get some space because he was screaming in my face). He accused me of not trusting him and became more verbally abusive over time. Eventually, he broke up with me, claiming we‚Äôd get back together once he started his business, but that he just didn‚Äôt have time for me. He also said he was dealing with mental health issues but refused to go to therapy. The night he dumped me, I went out with friends and went bar hopping. After drinking, it hit me late at night‚Äî‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm pregnant? We had unprotected sex.‚Äù So I took a test, and it was positive.

I started having a mental breakdown. I was hyperventilating. My worst fear was getting pregnant, and B knew that. My previous abusive ex (A) had sexually assaulted me. He also had a history of doing that to other women. A got me pregnant and I ended up miscarrying. It took me a long time to heal from that experience. When I got involved with B, I made it very clear from the beginning that I was terrified of getting pregnant. He spent a lot of time reassuring me that he would never leave me, even after we had unprotected sex.

That night, I tried texting B, but he was asleep and didn‚Äôt respond. My friends ended up bringing me more pregnancy tests to take. The next day, B finally replied, saying if I was pregnant, we‚Äôd figure it out and that he still liked me. But over the next week, he acted really strange. He called me about 7 times a day, almost every day, sexted me, and acted like we were still together. Then, things took a dark turn. He said some really hurtful things to me, like ""I don‚Äôt love you,"" and ""You should get an abortion."" Later, he backtracked and told me he didn‚Äôt mean any of it, claiming he just wanted to make it easier for me to move on.

Despite all of that, we got back together‚Äî even though we were already acting like we were together, and he kept insisting there was no one else. He acted weird about putting our relationship status back on Facebook. Eventually, he did update it, gave me a gift basket, and wrote me an apology letter full of the same excuses: that his biggest regret was dumping me, that he wanted to focus on his business, and that he was struggling mentally. He claimed he was excited about the baby and that we‚Äôd figure everything out.

Then things started to get even sketchier. He began treating me badly, telling me he‚Äôd rather play video games than spend time with me. At one point, while I was pregnant, he even said, ‚ÄúLife would be better if you were dead, haha.‚Äù I later found out that he had searched ""local hookups (his city)"" on Reddit, which I discovered through a local Facebook group was actually linked to prostitutes. He told me he had only been looking up porn the night we broke up, but I knew it didn‚Äôt make sense. The group he searched was local and had no photos‚Äîit was more than just porn. He was worried I‚Äôd tell his family about it. When I confronted him, he screamed in my face and told me to get out of his house. After a while, he calmed down. I was terrified because I was still pregnant, and I didn‚Äôt know where to go or what to do.

I ended up miscarrying after two months. He pretended to be supportive, but it was a struggle to get him to disconnect from his video games and come upstairs to be there for me while I was going through it. He told me everything would be okay and that we could try for kids again someday. I tried to hold on to those moments where he seemed supportive, but it was hard to ignore the feeling in my gut telling me that something wasn‚Äôt right.

Toward the end, he screamed at me and put his hand over my mouth after I found nudes of a ""friend from Tinder 5 years ago"" saved on his phone. I had told him it wasn‚Äôt appropriate, especially since they had a history of flirting and sending each other nudes, and I didn‚Äôt want him to have her on his Snapchat. After putting his hands on me, he apologized and promised he‚Äôd delete her. But just a few days before, he had threatened to delete¬†*me*¬†for her.

He asked me to visit him the weekend after he put his hands on me, and I felt terrified to go. Later, I found out through a ‚ÄúAre We Dating the Same Guy?‚Äù post that he had dumped me because he wanted to ask another woman out on a date. He had gone out with her while we were together and decided he wanted to pursue her. He lied to me and tried to keep me on the hook for sex, saying he‚Äôd want me back later. Only three hours after I told him I was pregnant and he promised we‚Äôd figure it out together, he asked her out, started talking to her about ""settling down"" and having a long-term relationship. She had no idea I was pregnant or that we were ever together. It hit me that he had been lying to me for months. Instead of being a responsible adult and supporting me, bringing me more pregnancy tests, he was in another woman's DMs.

I confronted him about everything. He tried to gaslight me at first and told me he had ""just asked her out for coffee as a friend."" When I told him I had the screenshots, he screamed at me and wouldn‚Äôt let me say anything. He called me ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù and said he never wanted me in his life again. He told me he didn‚Äôt believe I was ever really pregnant and suggested that I must‚Äôve used a two-year-old pregnancy test from when my other ex sexually assaulted me. He had never told me before that he thought I was lying about the pregnancy.

After all of that, he blocked me and ghosted me without giving me any real closure. Later, I found out from multiple women that he had been on Tinder while we were together. A lot of them said he‚Äôd been on Tinder from the time he took me ring shopping until the end of our relationship. One woman told me he claimed he was in an ‚Äúopen relationship‚Äù (which wasn‚Äôt true) and that he was a pilot (he wasn‚Äôt‚Äîhe was just visiting me). This was a week after he found out I was pregnant and after we got back together. It was the same day he gave me the apology gift basket.

I tried reaching out to him, offering to provide proof that the pregnancy was real. I also told him how awful he had treated me and asked for my things back. But he blocked me at every turn. So, I decided to contact his mom to explain what had happened (that I was pregnant, he cheated on me while I was pregnant, and he had put his hands on me) and to ask for my belongings since he lived in one of the houses she owns. She never responded, refused to look at any of the evidence, and his whole family unfriended me on everything.

His ex-girlfriend (the one he supposedly ended things on good terms with) told me he was narcissistic. She tried reaching out to his brother to help me get my things back. His brother, who barely knew me, called me ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and told her to ignore me. I also tried contacting his old roommate, who still needed to pick up his things, and another friend of his to get my stuff back. But as soon as I reached out, he would immediately call them, telling them I was ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and to ignore me. So, I sent them screenshots of everything that had happened, asked not to be dismissed, and continued to press the point that I just wanted my things back.

At one point, his friend got really rude, so I told her that if he didn‚Äôt send my things back, my only options were to send a cease and desist or do a civil standby. My ex immediately called my mom and yelled at her over the phone. My mom had previously tried to ask him to send my stuff back and even told him I was pregnant, but he had apparently blocked her. Asking for my things back was like pulling teeth. He sent my mom photos of my lingerie, saying I ‚Äúbarely had anything there‚Äù and shouldn‚Äôt expect him to send anything back. My mom offered to pay for the postage. He finally said he could leave my stuff outside for me to pick up. My mom told him I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that or driving 1.5 hours to get it. His response? ‚ÄúGood, because I would‚Äôve called the cops on her anyway.‚Äù He then said he‚Äôd told his neighbors to keep an eye out for me. He told my mom he had never cheated on me, threatened a restraining order, and even threatened a defamation suit (even though I had screenshots and evidence of everything). He said he‚Äôd only send my stuff back if I stopped talking to him, his family, and his friends, which is ironic since some of his friends have added me after the breakup and have been talking to me.

He was basically trying to control who I could talk to and stop me from telling the truth. In the end, my lawyer sent him a cease and desist to demand my things back, to tell him to stop making threats and trying to intimidate me, and to stop discrediting me. It‚Äôs been over a month, I‚Äôve tried reasoning with him, I‚Äôm tired of being smeared, and I‚Äôm emotionally exhausted.

At this point, I‚Äôve realized that him screaming in my face was completely unacceptable. It was a clear sign of him lying and was a form of abusive communication. But at the same time, I‚Äôm struggling because there was also a lot of good in him throughout much of our relationship. We bonded over so many things‚Äîour values, hobbies, religion, and life goals. I never imagined he was capable of any of this, and it‚Äôs been really hard for me to accept. I‚Äôve been struggling for the past month and a half, trying to move past everything. I‚Äôve been grieving the loss of our baby alone, and now I‚Äôm having to come to terms with the reality of who my ex really is. The stress has made me so physically ill that I‚Äôm now going to TRE and physical therapy for muscle tension. Meanwhile, he‚Äôs been chatting with other women on Reddit under posts asking for titty pics, using the same line he used with me: ‚ÄúHello fellow fish keeper!‚Äù He seemed so nice for so long, and now it‚Äôs just hard to process how he turned out.

just keep wondering: was any of the relationship real? Does he truly think I wasn‚Äôt pregnant? How could he do all of this to me? Why is he acting like I‚Äôm the threat when he‚Äôs the one who has harmed me? My mind has been looping these thoughts over and over, trying to find some peaceful solution for the past month and a half. I dreaded sending that cease and desist, but I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. Part of me doesn‚Äôt want to accept that he‚Äôs really harmed me. I keep wondering‚Äîwhat if this is all just a misunderstanding?

I‚Äôm really struggling right now and I‚Äôm desperately seeking any advice from people who have been through similar situations. I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing how you dealt with it, how you started healing, and any insights you can share to help me understand what I‚Äôm going through. I feel stuck and emotionally drained, and I just don‚Äôt know what to do next.",2025-02-21 10:20:57,2025-03-17 16:08:37,signs

I called and got transferred over multiples times, finally I reached someone saying that I could fill out a form and get it notarized but it‚Äôs not a guarantee and takes a couple months. So condescending about it too. How does that help me now?? 

You gave my abuser all of my information already, so why does that matter?? You failed me. I found a new place so I could get away, now you gave it to him.

1jablxw,He has a drinking problem and is kicking me out,NoPractice111,4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jablxw/he_has_a_drinking_problem_and_is_kicking_me_out/,"Hi friends, not sure if this is the right subreddit but I‚Äôm grasping at straws here. 
A little backstory:
My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months. We met off Tinder, but went to the same high school and have many mutual friends. After our first date, he was constantly trying to go on more dates with me and I was enamored; the connection was there. We began dating shortly after and he moved into a new house that needed some help fixing up. I helped him fix the house, and at that point I was spending so much time there that he was begging me to move in with him. Everything was great so far, so I figured why not. Through the months I met his whole family and I loved them, they accepted me as one of their own. We talked about marriage, having kids, how we‚Äôre both ready to settle down and have a family. 

We eventually moved into a new house (renting) and that‚Äôs when things started to take a turn. He started drinking, and he‚Äôs not the kind of person who can handle it. He doesn‚Äôt know when to stop. He will drink until he is belligerent and a completely different person. Usually when he gets that drunk, he will start an argument with me and try to pack up his things so he can leave. I never let him drive like that, so he‚Äôs never actually left. Every day after a fight like that‚Äôll, we always talk about how he has a problem with drinking and he‚Äôs going to stop. The usual. At first the fights were a month or two apart. And then it was every two weeks. This week it‚Äôs already happened twice. 

Last night after he lied to get me out of the house, he made me sit at a bar with him and his friend while he got drunk, and refused to let me drive his car. He then drove to drop his friend off, and then sat in his driveway with him for 3 hours drinking close to 18 beers while I sat there and twiddled my thumbs. My phone was dead at this point and I couldn‚Äôt do anything. Then he tries to leave. He can barely walk, can‚Äôt speak a coherent sentence, and wants to drive. At this point I‚Äôm crying, begging him to let me drive because I am stone cold sober. My best friend died from being in the car with a drunk driver and I am extremely uneasy about the situation. He refuses, rips out of the driveway, and takes down his friend‚Äôs mailbox. He severely damages the side of his car, gets a flat, and knocks off his side mirror in one go. He has to pull over and tells me to get a ride. My phone is dead, he will not let me use his. It is 1am. He starts calling me toxic for trying to control his drinking, and breaks up with me. 

I sit here now in our shared house and I am unsure what to do. I have no money to my name. He hasn‚Äôt let me have our (private) landlord‚Äôs number this whole time, and is saying he‚Äôs calling her to tell her I need to leave. All of my things are here and I have nowhere to go. I have also paid 40% of the rent this month which is good for 24 more days. Can he legally kick me out with no warning period..? Not that I want to stay, but I do need somewhere to rest my head while I figure out my next steps. I really am just at a loss. I got a concussion a few days ago (unrelated) and that, mixed with the emotions of what is going on is rendering me unable to think. 

TLDR; (now ex) boyfriend is trying to kick me out of a house that I have paid 40% of rent for, effective immediately.",2025-03-13 13:11:19,2025-03-17 16:08:41,signs

I‚Äôm reading more, I‚Äôm practicing somatic exercises, I‚Äôm taking the bus and going on walks, I‚Äôm sharing my pain and shame with friends and my professional supports, I‚Äôm advocating for tenant rights to build a paper trail, I‚Äôm saving more money just in case!",2025-02-23 13:36:13,2025-03-17 16:08:42,signs
1ix4hb2,It‚Äôs so much better on the other side‚Ä¶,wtfcarll123,16,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ix4hb2/its_so_much_better_on_the_other_side/,"I am 1 year and 6 months out of an abusive relationship. 

If you need a sign to leave, this is your sign. 

Things are so much better on the other side. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was tough at first. But it‚Äôs been so worth it. I‚Äôve grown so much as a person this last year and a half. I‚Äôve done things I had no idea I was capable of doing. I‚Äôve demonstrated my own resilience to myself and I continue to demonstrate my new found wisdom to myself. 

When I left him, I really took the time to educate myself on these things. I read, watched YouTube videos, explored websites of organizations fighting against DV, and more. I‚Äôve also been in therapy which has been a huge help for me. When I initially left, I watched the show Maid and I‚Äôm so glad I did because it helped boost me with the strength I needed to push through and pave a way for myself. 

I feel really lucky because I had really great people that were like lights helping guide the way. Coworkers, friends, mentors, and even strangers that I shared moments of vulnerability with. I made it a point to search out healthy couples. I had to know that there ARE healthy couples out there. Because when I realized I was being abused, I realized I had never seen a non-abusive relationship growing up and this influenced my subconscious view of relationships. 

But let me tell yall‚Ä¶ there truly are healthy and happy couples out there. I know, I didn‚Äôt think it was real either. But it is. And in knowing these couples and having them support me, on top of the educating I did for myself, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm ever settling. 

I even briefly dated someone who was so kind and gentle. It didn‚Äôt work out because they live in another country, but I‚Äôm thankful for him because he showed me how I deserve to be treated. 

I have become more financially independent and stable. I have my own 1 bedroom apartment with my 2 kitties. I left my old job to grow in my career and I‚Äôm really really succeeding and chasing my dreams! I have made SO MANY great friends that have shown me what real love looks like as well as exemplified healthy relationships with their significant others. And the ones that aren‚Äôt in relationships can relate to the experiences that I had and we our conversations are always fruitful if we do discuss abuse and whatnot. 

It hasn‚Äôt always been easy, but damn has it been worth it. I feel that I‚Äôm exactly where I need to be and on the right track. 

I think the hardest part at this point is seeing people I know or love stuck inside these terrible relationships with no idea of how terrible it actually is. And all I can do is just show them as much love as possible. 

But I also just want to continue practicing giving myself as much love as possible. 

I‚Äôm so thankful that I made it out. There are people out there waiting to support you and to love you. They are people out there that would carry you if they had to. There are opportunities waiting to make you feel fulfilled and accomplished. There‚Äôs a little person inside of you waiting for you to come ‚Äúhome‚Äù. 

Your life IS worth something. And you have something to offer the world. Just because you‚Äôre getting through the abuse doesn‚Äôt mean you have to. 

Do it for all of the survivors and victims before you and for all of the survivors and victims after you. There‚Äôs great liberation and empowerment in this. 

Don‚Äôt give up on yourself. Don‚Äôt give up on your dreams. And if you have forgotten what your dreams are, then there are plenty more to find and chase. You are worthy of kindness. You are worthy of support. You are worthy of being healthy. 

And for the love of God, always listen to your gut. Learn to trust yourself. Learn to listen to what your body knows and is telling you. There‚Äôs a reason you feel like shit. 

And remember that it‚Äôs soooo soooo sooooooo much better on the other side.   

I‚Äôm never going back. ",2025-02-24 15:21:00,2025-03-17 16:08:43,signs
1i3zpp2,I'm not sure what to do.,Lisaxss,3,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1i3zpp2/im_not_sure_what_to_do/,"Sorry this is a long post. TLDR at the bottom.

Backstory: my bf has been divorced for 5 years and has a teenage son from his precious marriage.


I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for six months, and we got engaged two weeks ago. Until now, our relationship had been great. Even during arguments, he never showed any signs of aggression‚Äîno shouting, no hitting walls, nothing like that. He would occasionally say mean things but would always apologize after calming down. I‚Äôve never once felt unsafe around him.

Last night, we went out to celebrate a new work contract I‚Äôd just signed. We had dinner, went to a bar, and played some pool‚Äîit was a fun night. However, we ended up arguing about something trivial. He asked why I never uploaded photos of him on my Instagram, and I reminded him that at the start of our relationship, he didn‚Äôt want me to because he was worried his ex-wife or son might see them. For some reason, this upset him now, and the conversation turned into a small argument. He said some hurtful things, so I suggested we end the night early and head home since he seemed drunk.

At this point, he grabbed my arm hard enough to pinch my skin. I pushed his arm away and told him not to grab me like that, explaining it made me uncomfortable because of my past abusive relationship (something he knows about). He called for a driver to take him home, and I called a taxi. Then, he suddenly asked me to cancel the taxi and go somewhere to talk. He kept insisting I go to his house, but I told him we should go home separately, sleep it off, and talk tomorrow.

Eventually, I gave in, and we went to a caf√© to talk. He kept saying he was a terrible person and that I shouldn‚Äôt be with him. Frustrated and exhausted, I finally said, ‚ÄúOkay, if that‚Äôs what you want.‚Äù He left, and after waiting 10 minutes, I left too.

As I walked to the taxi pick-up area, he came back, insisting I go to his house. He grabbed my arm aggressively and started pulling me. I felt scared and told him I needed to use the bathroom. I ran to a public restroom, locked the door, and stayed inside. He waited for five minutes before pounding on the door and yelling.

When I finally opened it, I told him I was tired and just wanted to go home and sleep, hoping he‚Äôd calm down. For a moment, it seemed to work. But as soon as we got outside and I said I was calling a taxi, he grabbed my phone. I asked for it back, but he started swearing and grabbed me again. I shouted at him to let me go and managed to get my phone back.

That‚Äôs when he punched me in the face. The impact made me fall, and while I was on the ground, he kicked me in the face twice before bystanders intervened. He ran off.

The police were called, and I was taken to the hospital. I needed 10 staples in my head because of a wound I got when my head hit the wall during the attack. My face is swollen and bruised, and I‚Äôm in so much pain.

Today, he‚Äôs sent me over 100 messages apologizing and claiming he can‚Äôt remember what happened. He‚Äôs begging me to drop the police case, saying he‚Äôll lose his job and won‚Äôt be able to provide for his son.

Should I drop the case and just ask him to never contact me again? I‚Äôve met his son, and he‚Äôs such a sweet kid. I don‚Äôt want to hurt him, but I also just want this to be over. Any advice?

TLDR/ My fianc√© of six months, who had never shown aggression before, assaulted me during an argument, leaving me hospitalized, and now he's begging me to drop the charges, citing his son‚Äôs well-being. Any advice?",2025-01-18 04:33:22,2025-03-17 16:08:44,signs
1iy9hyy,Judge refused a temporary Order of Protection,auraqueen,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iy9hyy/judge_refused_a_temporary_order_of_protection/,"I am so heartbroken and scared.

Today I went to family court to file an OOP petition that I prepared with the local DV shelter. I just signed it, dropped it off, and a judge would look at it at some point either today or tomorrow and make a determination. My petition included details of physical/sexual/financial/psychological abuse by my soon-to-be-ex husband that has escalated over the past few years and months. He showed up at my place unannounced and acting manic just over a week ago and I had to call the police, which finally scared me enough to pull the trigger on an OOP.

Both my therapist (who also works as a DV support in court), the DV shelter, as well as the clerk that helped me file the petition were all in agreement that it was likely I would AT LEAST get a temporary order.

Just found out this evening that the judge refused to issue a temporary order of protection, and issued a court date 2 WEEKS AWAY. Either already tonight or tomorrow, my spouse will receive his court summons which includes an entire copy of my petition, where I call out his abusive behavior. This will make him beyond angry, and will give him ample opportunity to hide his firearms and other weapons before court in case an order is granted afterwards. My best guess is that the judge thinks I'm being vindictive because my husband is the plaintiff in our divorce, and the OOP was filed after I was served papers.

So for the next two weeks and likely long after, I get to live in absolute terror that I just poked the bear. That the man that has already been abusive to me, has nothing deterring him to abuse me further. And my hopes of an OOP are completely crushed; if a judge didn't deem it necessary to grant a temporary one based off my petition, as brutal as it was, why would he decide to make one permanent?

I am disgusted by this judge and my county. They would rather protect an abuser's temporary rights than protect a victim and potentially save a life.

My ex accidentally raped me in my sleep.


And he thought I was awake.

I have evidence of him admitting to the rape in texts he sent me and audio.

He also admitted to abusing me in text, apologized for gaslighting me in audio, evidence of him saying he is sorry for the verbal abuse but then does it more in text evidence of all of the verbal abuse. 

Evidence of him writing a letter of him admitting to raping me, grabbing my arms to the point of bruising them, verbal abusing me, and saying I can use that written letter in court if he ever physically or sexually abuses me again. He dated it and signed his name on it. And yes he ended up physically abusing me, grabbing my face and screaming at me, and verbally abusing me again after that.  

Unfortunately we work together after all of that. And a coworker got into our business at work, only after he pretended to be friends with me and no doubt sniffed out my vulnerabilities and distraught state. 

He outside of work, encouraged my vents usually, and knew ive been gaslit. I broke down in the car trying to verbally process and not sure what to believe between the good I see with my ex at work. And that coworker may have recorded that breakdown where Im not sure if the the rape was an accident but my body remembers how it felt, saying a lot of maybes and what ifs about what my ex did to me with rape and abuse like maybe i shouldn‚Äôt of called the cops that day maybe he is a good guy, maybe i could of let him calm down while screaming at me while driving the car and verbally abusing me. Beating myself up constantly thinking I did something to deserve it. And said I was scared.

Will a video of all that take away the written and text evidence I have on my ex? will it look like defamation and false allegations of rape if I go to court? and a video like that gets shown? And its already getting around to other coworkers at work where they think I lied about my ex and the car scare.

State is VA.

He threatened to kill me if I left him, and I've left. He has guns and conceal carry etc.

He was arrested and then released on bond apparently. This means he is loose in the world again, right? Does he get to have his guns while he awaits the criminal trial? Am I safe from him shooting me, or does he still have guns?

Is this a good sign for my progress? I had what I felt was a lot of evidence of ongoing abuse and they wouldn't arrest him if they didn't think there wasn't a good chance of him being convicted, right? How does that work?

It says assault- specifically labeled as simple assault against a family member. From what I have read for my state, it is a class one misdemeanor. The word simple is throwing me off I think, because it was repeated physical and sexual assault, but maybe that is just the wording. 

What should I do next? I am appealing the protective order (they denied it initially) and pressing criminal charges. Am I on an okay track, am I doing okay with this? I just really need some guidance, I don't know how this system works and it has been extremely traumatic recounting what happened repeatedly.

He didn't choke me per se but he was holding on to my neck for sure. I started crying (hiding the tears form him because then he gets mad that I kill the vibe), and just hid behind my hair and let him finish his strategy. Then he saw me and started hugging me and saying oh no im sorry I didn't want to take you to that place (inside of my head speaking), and I was like, it's okay and he was like no, because now I feel bad, the vibe changed.

He stayed at my place and I was just so confused because I couldn't believe what just happened, did he really grab my neck because of a stupid video game?

Any way, I'm not gonna ask if this is a reflag because I know it is, I want to ask about how y'all felt when this happened to you ( the first time he showed violence), I know this is very likely to happen again, but then again sometimes I think it was just a one time mistake.  
I ve been talking with him normally and I feel somehow ashamed, idk. This was just so off :(  
Bye we're both 27, have been dating for about 8 months, and the only previous sign of violence was once he hit the seat of the car in which I was in.  
Is this really that bad? I know most people say this will escalate and that this is a red flag but im so confused because he is not a bad person and it came out of nowhere.  
Btw he's also super verbally and emotionally abusive when we are having any sort of problem as a couple and I get so anxious I hurt myself, either by bruising my self or hitting my head",2025-02-18 01:37:41,2025-03-17 16:08:53,signs
1ixjadp,Pregnant and trying to leave my abusive husband,Dear-Peach-,4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ixjadp/pregnant_and_trying_to_leave_my_abusive_husband/,"Hey guys. I don‚Äôt really know where to start. My husband has been abusing me for about a year now (out of the year and a half we‚Äôve been together). He has held loaded guns to my head, held me hostage in my own bedroom, strangled me, etc. I called the cops back in August for the strangulation incident, for which court is still ongoing. They put a temporary protection order in place, however I‚Äôve still been in contact with him. I have a video from today of him threatening to beat me up and slapping my leg. He also pushed me a couple of days ago, and I fell pretty hard which was a huge concern for me because I‚Äôm pregnant. I don‚Äôt want my baby to be hurt. Here is the thing: I could take that video to the police right now and no questions asked they would arrest him on violation of the protection order. Or I can hide the fact I‚Äôm pregnant (from the courts, he knows I‚Äôm pregnant), divorce him, and try to flee. He talks a lot out of anger, but he said he didn‚Äôt want to be a part in this babies life so I think it would be easy to get him to sign divorce papers without mentioning I‚Äôm pregnant.  Basically to sum it up: if I send him back to jail he might make this divorce harder than it needs to be vs if I do it the other way. however I‚Äôm not sure if that would be the safest. I‚Äôm also concerned that there‚Äôs a chance he could get visitation rights. He says he has a video of me (naked) yelling in his face, which is probably true because after so long of being abused I did start to act out of character, until finding out I was pregnant. If anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them. ",2025-02-25 01:41:36,2025-03-17 16:08:55,signs
1iucumd,The permanent damage,_ultraviolenta,5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iucumd/the_permanent_damage/,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I've been very emotional these past few weeks. We broke up almost 4 months ago, I cried every day for the first two and then by last month in January I didn't cry a single day. I thought I was clean. However, these past few weeks I've been getting emotional about him again and I've been crying. I don't know if ""missing"" is the right word, I don't want to talk to him or let him into my life in any way again, but I feel very nostalgic lately remembering the good times. Maybe I just miss having someone who ""loves"" me with me, a partner.

And I see myself unconsciously making the same judgments to others that he made to me and I feel horrible, I don't want to become the horrible person that he is. His words come to my mind constantly telling me what a whore I am. I feel all the damage he did to me like a burden on my back that I'm now spreading to other people. And I feel bad and I blame myself, like who the fuck told me to fall in love with a sociopath? The signs were there from the beginning and now I can't live in peace even though he's not even close to me. Sometimes I wish I had never met him.

The worst thing is that none of his hallucinations ended up being true because not only was I never unfaithful to him, but since we separated I never went out with anyone or saw anyone again. It's not that I don't want to, I'd love to be able to say that he's not the last person who laid a finger on me, it's just that I don't feel motivated enough to meet people again and have his unbearable prejudices tormenting my head. He's not with me, he doesn't talk to me anymore, he left me alone like I wanted after considering reporting him; however, I feel that the damage he did to me is permanent and I'll never be at peace. I can't even drink alcohol cause it reminds me of and it tastes like him. At what point does a person truly heal? When will I really stop hearing him inside me?

Recently we were sitting by the fire just talking about Christmas and how lovely it was to be with friends and his family and out of nowhere my partner blurts out ""I would kill you if you ever cheated on me and then I would kill the man you cheated on me with and then l'd go to prison and our children would be orphans"" and I kind of got worried and instantly reassured him that would never happen and we continued on with our conversation and night. I'm unsure where it came from as our relationship has been great and there have been no signs of any worry from either party but this has concerned me because prior to meeting my partner I was in a very abusive relationship and he knows this too. I'm taken back and don't know what to think or how to act. I'm very worried for my safety, not that I would ever cheat on him but it worries me that he had that thought randomly and he was so serious about it and had such a stone cold look on his face. To make matters worse I am alone, I have no parents they passed in a car accident when I was very young and I have no family around me at all. I'm unsure how to navigate this or what to do going forward. Any advice on how to talk about this with my partner or bring it up in conversation?


TL;DR My partner threatened to kill me if I cheated on him completely out of nowhere and I don't feel safe and comfortable around him anymore",2024-12-29 23:34:07,2025-03-17 16:08:58,signs
1izb0jo,Finally got counselling organised,RipOk3600,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1izb0jo/finally_got_counselling_organised/,"So since my ex wife and I broke up in November she has embarked on a campaign to try to destroy my reputation and my life.  

I was in a psych ward for 2 weeks after we broke up and she was constantly messaging me trying to get me to sign over the house my mum left me when she died.

She has made continuous false comments on social media designed to paint herself as a victim and destroying my reputation in the meantime, including to people we work with.

She has messaged my family trying to paint me as an alcoholic.  When dad said she and I needed to work out our property together she accused my dad of being a terrible person and telling him my mum would be ashamed of him (dad is still grieving mum, it‚Äôs only been a couple of years and they were together for over 20 years)

When she wasn‚Äôt getting her own way she would then use her kids (my former step children) to try and get what she wanted, dragging a 12 year old and a 14 year old into situations which were nothing to do with them

She has called the police and animal welfare falsely to try and get her own way 


Thankfully when she moved out of my house she moved in with a mutual friend of ours and after that friend saw her behaviour she contacted me and said ‚ÄúI have really seen a different side of her‚Äù and ‚Äúif you get back together with her you would be an idiot‚Äù.  She also told me my ex was making joking comments to her that ‚Äúoh well if I don‚Äôt find anything better he will always take me back‚Äù.  My ex also called the police on our friend again because she didn‚Äôt get her own way and threatened to have her attacked because she ‚Äúknows people‚Äù.

If it wasn‚Äôt for the support of my dad and my sister and my friend I think I would be completely losing my mind.  Her comments just don‚Äôt match with reality and as a result I just don‚Äôt feel emotionally safe even in my own home.  I had a panic attack when the police turned up, I had another one when I found out she had called animal welfare and it‚Äôs just been constant.

And now looking back over the relationship the gaslighting has been constant, for example complaining when I wanted to spend any money on myself and yet always buying stuff herself.  Complaining if I asked her for money when I was paying almost all the bills and she only ever paid a couple. It wasn‚Äôt until after she moved out and I found out she was telling everyone she paid all the bills that I sat down and listed what I had been paying and realised she basically paid nothing and I have no idea where all her money went.

I ended up calling the government domestic violence line the other night and talking to them and they validated the experiences I had been going through and that yes it is considered domestic violence (cohesive control, legal abuse, social abuse) and put me onto a counselling service who I have finally been able to get an appointment with.  

In some ways it would have been easier if she had been physically violent the way her son has been with us all year.  At least when I had concussion from him hitting me in the head with a metal drink bottle I could say ‚Äúno this did happen, and it is wrong‚Äù but the emotional manipulation has in effect twisted me around completely.  For example when we had to have her son move out because of the constant attacks she had wanted to turn his bedroom into a craft room and I had kept saying not to because it would make it harder for him to move back in and then months latter when I am trying to ensure that there are safety plans in place when he moves back in being attacked by her saying I never wanted him here which is the complete opposite of the truth (in fact he has actually said his mum has told him multiple times that she wishes it was just her and her daughter).

Between the physical violence from him and the emotional manipulation from her I really wonder if I could ever go into another relationship again because all I keep thinking whenever I contemplate dating again is how would I protect myself? Would this just happen again?

1j3jgex,Feeling angry with abuser's parents,SparklesandStilettos,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j3jgex/feeling_angry_with_abusers_parents/,"I am seriously going through the 5 stages of grief since my incident. I've already made a post about the full story of what happened on 2/17 with my now ex-fiance of only 48 hours. Long story short, an argument about him saying he was going to kill my dog turned into him approaching me in our bedroom with his sheriff duty weapon shouting, ' what did you say?"" twice in a threatening manner. I ran out barefoot once he left the room. I tried for 3 hours to get him to leave after trying my 2 resources, and staying with them wasn't an option. I called my mom, with whom he has a good relationship, and she said she couldn't even get him to listen to her and was manic. I called his mom and told her about what happened in the past to give context. I told her I was barefoot at a gas station with nowhere to go, no wallet, ID or money. She said her husband is on the phone with him now and began saying she didn't raise him that way, she doesn't know where he got that from, he's never witnessed abuse, He was a good kid, and no fights, don't let a man put his hands on you, etc. All of this was lies because he has told stories of her being abused and him fighting in school She ignored the fact I am calling her because I am barefoot as a gas station because her son pulled a gun on me. She had no sense of urgency to help the situation and even told him once he found out I called her that she just wants to stay out of it. I felt no need to discuss further with her if she felt that way. She called back  and I didn't answer. I was too busy trying to figure it out on my own after that. I decided I need some documentation here after the 2 instances of abuse. The first time, he showed up on his motorcycle intoxicated and slammed me up against a concrete wall while pregnant with his child, which made me run to get an abortion I didn't want to have the next day because I was afraid of being stuck with him and broke up with him for a few weeks. The second time, he put me in some kind of headlock, took me to the ground, and put his knee on my neck. It was over going to get ice cream with a friend; he didn't believe I was still there at 8pm when I left at 5pm and hadn't seen her in months. He begged and begged for another chance, went to therapy for 9 months, and there was no sign of physical abuse until this incident. We moved in together and got engaged this past Valentine's Day. I felt at this point his behavior needed to be documented, and I went to the police. I told him I was going, but he still refused to leave. I told him when the officers arrived, but he still refused to leave and told me to ""Do what you gotta do,"" and if he loses his job, we are going to have a problem, so I hung up. I don't know who that person was, but at that point I felt he was unpredictable. The police arrived at our apartment, and he was still there in the bed as if nothing happened. He was combative with them and made up 3 stories, and they arrested him on aggravated assault after he admitted to my story. After realizing he was in jail with no bond, his mom pressured me to write letters to the DA and his supervisor to keep his job, and then victim shamed me for staying with him after the 2 previous incidents and said, ""The past is the past, and you went on trips with him after that,"" as if what he did didn't matter. I am feeling pretty upset today because she could of helped that night and showed up to get him in that 3-hour timeframe, so I felt comfortable and had somewhere safe to stay like my mom would have done for me The incident happened at 8pm and went on until 11pm before I called the police. I know ultimately it is no one's fault except his, but they including him seem to think it is my fault because I got the police involved. I'm sure he is telling all kinds of lies, like he did the police, and they seem to think he can do no wrong and are unwilling to consider that maybe he doesn't tell them the truth. I am disgusted she would defend his past behavior just because I stayed with him after and gave him another chance. I genuinely feel I tried my best that night to stop him from going to jail by going to be with his friends, frat brothers, or family that night. His interaction with the police is what got him arrested. He refused to leave when they asked too. Why am I so wrong for calling?",2025-03-04 19:38:35,2025-03-17 16:09:01,signs
1j8mg8j,Do I (F19)leave my boyfriend (M21) of three years?,devynnyved,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j8mg8j/do_i_f19leave_my_boyfriend_m21_of_three_years/,"My boyfriend is so great to me, he is kind, caring, respectful, connects with my family. We have some slight issues, he still has no career goals/no drive, the jealousy issues have been a work in progress but have gotten significantly better. I could go into more detail regarding those issues but the most recent event is what I need advice on. When my BF drinks he has always become more jealous, incoherent, not recognizable etc. When drinking together it typically ends with him getting mad, me crying or me crying because I think he is upset, obviously I realize this is my anxiety from the past times we've drank. Typically, the morning after these events I start to gaslight myself about why I was so upset as the alcohol hurts the memory, although I remember the feelings being real last night I typically question the details which makes me less confident of my emotions so we both apologize have conversation and feel better. 

Last halloween (2024) my sister (F23) my BF and I went out, my sister and I were at a table talking to some guys, my BF saw this and I waved him over, he has this face like I had murdered his mother. I instantly try to shut this down cause I can't handle it, long story short he was insanely hammered (not an excuse) and pushed me hard into a hightop, tried to come after me again and my sister got in between him and I. I had my hands in my hair stressed and he commented I hope you rip it out. He had never been physical while drunk with me before at this point, the next morning he can't remember so I tell him. He starts to cry, apologize etc, we discuss recognizing limits. I tell him if it happens again I will leave him but all in all I end up comforting him then forgiving and forgetting. 

3 days ago it happened again, I asked him to sober up while I was outside waiting with my friend till their ride came, I come back and he obviously worse. Later, I explain I was just sad and wished he had sobered up when I asked. He kept claiming he had nothing wrong, once I was ready for bed I told him I was headed up and he ignored me then called his friends inviting them over. As I am grabbing the rest of my things to head to the bedroom, he tells me he is tired of this. With that I finally loose control over my emotions, i start to cry and tell him he is being very mean and I head upstairs and lock the door behind me. 3 minutes later he is knocking, his sister is sleeping in the room over and I was nervous he was going to wake her up so I crack it and very calmly tell him i'm going to sleep alone tonight, or I can even more to the other bedroom and he can have this one, that I just need space. He begins to tell me I should be the one alone, I am a waste of his time and tells me he wont talk to me when I go on my trip, I explain that isn't what I said and I just need some space, he then switches me and asks me to leave him alone during my trip and leaves. 2 minutes later he is back but more aggressively shaking the knob then banging, i crack the door at this point he aggressively bodies the door open hitting me and asking me ""whos in here?"" I am starting to cry again and keep repeating ""please leave, please just leave"" I try pushing to just get him out of the doorway, he won't move and is silent. Now I am scared and shakily still begging him to leave, as an attempt to scare him I say ""I am going to call my parents"", he starts smiling and laughing in my face and eventually does leave the room after I stop talking, he calls me a bitch as I shut and lock the door. I had to call my dad to come get me, while he went back out, lost his phone and was even walked home by the cops. Before he lost the phone he was sending miss spelled texts, that he can't figure me out and I am a mistake. 

He doesn't remember this the next morning, says he is sorry if he disrespected me and that he thought we had a goodnight. After explaining what happened, he tells me he is sorry, how he is disgusted with himself etc. I leave for a 2 week europe trip today with my sister, I told him we could talk more when I get back. I know I should end it, I know these are signs, I am just terrified of the hurt, I genuinely love him, we have a great relationship aside from the drinking, he is my best friend, so kind and loving when sober. I guess I just want advice from people who don't know us or has been through something similar, as well as possible advice for ending it/getting through the breakup.

But the crushing guilt set in now. The concern for his mental state. It also appears that he might actively be avoiding my attorney trying to contact him about the divorce / alimony etc. I think that because he has been reaching out to all of my siblings‚Ä¶calling them as if nothing has happened. Almost seems like he is reverting back to a state from years ago to cope with everything. I don‚Äôt know. But it‚Äôs concerning and I feel awful. I feel even more awful because I met another man who is the kindest , most loving person and it makes me feel terrible. I was NOT looking. I met him while I was posting healing things online and we connected on spirituality and we just clicked. 
Now I feel terrible about it all. 

Like I feel that I should  be suffering alone or it doesn‚Äôt make what i went through real. Does that make sense? Like how dare I feel happiness .

I haven‚Äôt told anyone what I‚Äôm about to say here but I‚Äôm feeling so alone and honestly I have no one to talk to, I‚Äôve lost all my friends, I don‚Äôt really have family and I‚Äôm confused, i grew up in a way that abuse was very normalized & I saw a lot, it was imbedded into me that abuse was just apart of love and ‚Äúfamily‚Äù. Now that I‚Äôm older I‚Äôm left with much confusion on what I‚Äôm in and if I‚Äôm in danger at all? My husband which I love so much has extreme rage at times. 5 years ago while we were home he blew up at me for talking to the neighbor he didn‚Äôt tell me that was why but that‚Äôs the only thing I could think of that triggered him. He‚Äôs never told me why. He forgot it even happened I feel like.  We never talked about that night after it happened. That night was a nightmare for me, and I can‚Äôt forget it. I have dreams about it alot and was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety & depression. Along with OCD (which doesn‚Äôt help with the obsessive thoughts the are constant) 

*TRIGGER WARNING* 
The night it happened, He pretty much came from our room and started attacking me, no warning, no lead up. He ended up dragging me across the floor by my hair, throwing me out the door as I gathered myself up he snatched me up and threw me back into the apartment where I ended up face down on the floor, he got ontop of me and ended up scratching me up, biting my face pretty hard & ended up dragging me to our bed where he started strangling me. His eyes were black and he was gone I fought so hard and I thought I was going to die. I don‚Äôt know why he stopped but he did. I begged for my life that night after he stopped strangling me all he could do was roll me off the bed just to pick me up and slam me back down and yell in my face to ‚Äúgo to fucking sleep.‚Äù I cried in pain and agony all night and was too scared to move or even go in the bathroom to look at the damage done to my face or body.  Fast forward now,  5 years later nothing to that extreme has happened again. Every now and then he has a fit of rage where he will scream at me, throw things, belittle me, compare me to my abusive family or tell me I do nothing and he could do everything on his own but then he apologized, and it‚Äôs like he completely changed into someone different, Takes me out, spoils me as he calls it.  I love him, he‚Äôs all I know I‚Äôm 28 and he‚Äôs 42 I know he has lived more life than I have but he can be extremely hard on me and his expectations of me are extremely high. I do my best to keep him happy & love him the best I know how. I know the bad is bad but the good is so good I can‚Äôt imagine living life without him, I know that sounds so dumb after someone has hurt you but I really love this man. He says he loves me so much but why does he do the things he does?  Does he really love me can he change or will I have to worry forever? Why do I feel so guilty for saying anything? I feel as if I‚Äôm betraying him by writing this. I‚Äôm not sure if this is even allowed here I‚Äôm just so alone. Confused.  Thank you for reading this far I know it‚Äôs so so long.

I had no idea she hadn;t had any valium since before surgery and had nothing else... she thoght she couldnt take them with the oxys. (which also make her crazy no doubt)  
Me making dinner was the trigger, and she came in and threw away what I was doing and was gonna try and make her own, when I tried to intervene cuz, you know...surgery...  
next thing I know she's bending me over the chest freezer onto the metal kitchen can onto the floor choking me and screaming in my face  
I honestly dont know how i got away or how she let me up but she did it again in the living room over the recliner so the wooden arms dug into me...cuz I was trying to call her therapist so someone could witness the screaming...she punches herself in the eye while holding me down by my neck screaming ""Ow! stop hitting me"" and says if I call the cops we're both going to jail.

of course I dont call the cops, im not gonna put her in jail with a 7 inch incision on her neck.

  
Today was a waste of time trying to figure anything out. had an appt at the clinic and didnt even get to address my issues because THIS - and he gives me a damn virtual telehealth mental health provider and says they do couples too... ugh still wondering if he made notes about it in my chart

I had to just lockmyself inmy room when I got home and take a fuckin nap. I hurt all in my sternum, ribs to my hip. I'm 55 and got enough arthritis to know the difference. got a good bruise on my jaw too

She told me her Dr called and said of course take the valium, and now she's fine and the dr says she's fine and it was just the drugs and it will never happen again...see? 

I maintained ""normal"" this evening thru dinner and we were gonna watch the Kamala Rally...she started to get ready for bed and I told her I was using her ice packs for my INJURIES..(.because I'm still salty and wanted to make sure she knew just because I was speaking to her doesn't mean we're all good, I'm just not ready to ""talk about it"" yet)  


So she said something about me heurting more than HER and proceeded to hit her head on the door and throw herself into the wall and break a cookie jar onher head to make a point...I tolf her to knock it TF off and stop being ridiculous and now im on the floor being choked again...this time she's got a shard from the cookie jar at my eye/cheek  
She also said to go ahead and sleep tonight and see if I wake up  
that she's taking the other cat of ours, even if she kills it by throwing it out the window of the car  
I'm locked in my room for now and ses in bed but of course it's my fault I started YELLING at her about the ice packs...  


I'm done. But I can't deal with the undoing of this...the unentanglement.  
I'm trying to give her a few days to sell what she can and fill the car (that's in her name that I bought her...)

I own this house, I'm NOT leaving. She already said that if I leave she'll kill both cats and trash the house

Now it's conveniently the weekend and nobody's on call...whoo would I call anyway?

She's managed to run off my kids so I have NC with them and cant even find them now... I'm ashamed to tell friends because we are ""so in love"" as they all say...

My shoulders and neck pain is getting worse and I can feel the swelling.  
I've been in bad and absive relationships, NEVER had someone strangle me and I dont know what to do I am frozen in fear and pissed too. BUT I dont wanna be the bad guy of course...

I'm going to uber to the ER if I can't swallow by morning...and that will be the end of it,

He has never hit or strangled me, or laid a finger on me in anger. He knows this is a very hard line that I draw in the sand and that I'll immediately end the relationship if he does. Sometimes he slaps/bites me (jokingly) a little harder than I like, and I'll say ""ow that hurts"" but he says I'm no fun and just too sensitive. He also puts his hands around my neck, without applying any pressure, and pretends to strangle/throttle me. Or he will wind up/raise his hand as if he's preparing to hit/lunge at me, then stop at the last minute before he hits me. If I flinch/look frightened, he will laugh at me and say he's just messing around/joking and that I'm too sensitive, or act offended that I think he was *actually* going to hit me. He makes jokes about strangling, killing, or hurting me on a regular (sometimes daily/multiple times a day) basis and looks offended or acts like I'm being crazy anytime I ask him why he keeps joking about it.

Is this considered ""physical abuse"" even though he has not actually hit me? Or is it just mental/emotional abuse?

We had been arguing and she turned off the bedroom light while I was in it, where I live it‚Äôs really dark with no street lights in a village so I turned it back on and she went nose to nose with me, my first reaction was to push her out the way as I‚Äôd been in a DV relationship over 5 years ago and at this point it‚Äôs just reflex when someone gets too close.

I don‚Äôt want to write too much about myself but let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm from the south asian community and abuse and toxic family dynamics have always been involved in my family. I was abused by my parents and siblings all my life I‚Äôm not innocent either I normally fight back because I am being abused or just have to defend myself or others sometimes. 

I was asking for something really simple and my brother just got really angry and because I was reaching to show him he pushed me back and grabbed my throat and was shouting and swearing. I got really angry and swore back and said I‚Äôm going to call the police because he did this. My younger brother (25 m) just came and intervened and I was trying to remove him but he was not going.

I didn‚Äôt think they could hear through the voice mail or message where they ask you what department you want but they heard all the commotion. 

I‚Äôm just tired of being abused of being told because we‚Äôre Asian we can‚Äôt do that or because we‚Äôre Muslim we have to tolerate it.

It's a bit of a long story but I feel this isn't right and I want to talk about it. 

I don't have a job which can support me enough for my life and I asked to my father some money to help me, they weren't many. Some days after he said he gave me some money and when I said that some were still missing, he said he would strangle me just because I didn't say thank you but said that some money were missing. He said it in a way that he wouldn't do for real, but what he said was pretty bad and let me explain why. 

Several years ago after I returned from studying abroad for one year, my father and mother both would say violent things to me. They have been always violent towards each other but they increased their verbal violence to me. I felt suicidal. He would tell things such as I break your bones or that I took drugs when that is not true, and what made me plan to escape was that he threatened me to beat me up because I talked about changing tactics with his customers/clients. After that, I planned to escape and successfully escaped from home. I lived some years abroad with one of my exes but he was abusive to me as well and wanted to kill me so I was forced by the circumstances to return home. 

I hoped things would be different at home, he was still offensive and insulting but not at the level to threaten to beat me up. 

I am also recovering from a very bad depressive episode where I struggled to eat and even fainted. I need a good environment to heal and although my mother had some narcissistic episodes which I could somehow work through, I really felt my father shouldn't say he would strangle me even if he didn't want to say that. 

He is obsessed with spending money (compulsive shopping) in general and he has a good job (not too rich but still wealthy). 

Most of the times he was so abusive to me was for money. But I didn't expect he would say that. 

I am in a position where escaping again would make me loose many money I worked on and without a good job it is difficult, plus I am still recovering from depression. Another alternative is to never talk to him again although it doesn't seem to have worked so much. I don't know what to do. I just feel what he said is wrong and want to do something for it but dnk what.

Me (20) and my boyfriend (20) have been seeing each for two months. He has always been so constant about being with me. I heard a knock on my dorm door and it was him showing up with my favorite food. That was when I let him in my life. Right within the first days he started saying he is in love with me and sees himself being with me for the rest of his life. He was very rough when I met him, he would pin me down and grab my wrist super tight and lightly choke me. I thought it was hot and eventually, over time he stopped that dominant behavior. Everything seemed good, he would constantly want to be over my dorm and be with me. I caught him knocking on my door for 4 mins straight before he left. He even lied about it to me, trying to gaslight me that it wasn't him. When he admitted it was him he said it's cause he didn't want to seem like he was down bad for me. Two-three weeks ago, we hit a bump in our relationship. He strangled me. He usually just lightly puts his hand over my throat. But this time, I think I triggered something because I said a guy texted me saying he wanted to come over to fuck me. He said that I was only his and strangled me, putting his two hands roughly against my throat squeezing me. I almost passed out. It was the scariest experience ever. I had trauma the entire week of falling asleep because I was scared I wouldn't wake up. Eventually, we moved past this as he is seeking professional help since he wants to be better for me. Lately, he has been on good behavior and hasn't done anything bad. I think our relationship is going in a good direction. He met my parents already. Just today I felt like throwing up and he raised his voice, basically wanting to force me to walk it off or throw it up when I just wanted to relax against the wall. What do you guys think about our relationship ? Red flag or we worked things out well.


There's more too. I talked with him when I was high, curious to know what was the freakiest stuff he has done. He told me he was with a girl in high school who liked extreme stuff. She loved when My bf would punch her, leave her bruises, bite her roughly, choke her roughly and aggressive stuff like that including slapping. He said he forced himself to like stuff like that for her because he felt like she was the only option he had. He supposedly says he wasn't turned on by any of this stuff... but I talked deeper with him and also if this could be why he strangled me last that and he said maybe. Is it normal for a regular guy to even do that violent stuff with a girl? Or is it not normal for a guy to agree to do that stuff with a girl? I don't know how to feel about this... I don't know if I should be concerned or be like it was a phase or something....",2023-05-22 07:47:23,2025-03-17 16:10:33,strangle

We‚Äôre both recovering alcoholics, and last night we made the stupid decision to have a few beers because we‚Äôd been struggling with relapses here and there and hiding/lying about it. We end up getting into a huge argument about how I feel he‚Äôs distant and not as affectionate towards me lately. It spiraled into a bunch of random issues I‚Äôve been bottling up. Things were calming down and then once we got into bed to lay down, we ended up fighting about something else.

He then proceeded to strangle me for a good 30 seconds- a minute. I can‚Äôt even remember what he said in the moment but his face was red and fuming. I just kept telling him to ‚Äúdo it‚Äù because in the moment I was so heartbroken and depressed I wanted to die. 

He immediately apologized, hugged me, and told me that seeing me holding the knife made him have a PTSD episode (history of war, abusive parents, being jumped, etc). Now that I‚Äôve slept on it and sobered up, I can‚Äôt get this feeling of a weight on my chest to go away. I felt so safe with him prior to this.

1iw3gxx,My best friend was murdered by her ex,genericname1211,323,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iw3gxx/my_best_friend_was_murdered_by_her_ex/,"I‚Äôm telling this story as a cautionary tale. On February 3 of 2025, my best friend was brutally murdered by her ex boyfriend. He waited in her car until she got off work. Got her to go to a more secluded location. And some time after that, he stabbed her 40+ times and left her in the trunk of her own car. He then drove to our local mall and met up with a friend. He showed this friend what he did, and thankfully that friend called the police. 

This is how it ended, I‚Äôm going to tell you how it all started. It started in high school. It started with him threatening to kill himself to get her to hang out with him. 

It started with something that small. It escalated quickly. She told me about a night when he got angry with her, and he started strangling her until she was blue in the face. He still lived with his parents at the time. She told me the look in his eyes was really scary. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like he wasn‚Äôt there anymore.‚Äù Or something to that effect. He had cheated multiple times by this point. Only a year or two into the relationship.

There was a night in 2020 on his own birthday, where we decided he wanted to kill himself. He was high and drunk. He got in her car, and she got in with him. She honestly wanted what was best for him. She really did love him at the time. And when she got him to pull over, she took the keys and ran away. He very quickly caught up to her and tackled her through a fence. The took the keys and took off in the car. He got into two hit and runs. They had a no contact order in place when he got to jail. He was only sentenced to 6 months. Though his rap sheet should‚Äôve put him away longer. He committed grand theft auto, two hit and runs, DUI, simple domestic assault, and other minor charges. He broke the no contact order by calling a friend and having that friend connect their calls. He would send letters to a friend and word them in a way where he was talking about her, and not to her. So they would get to her. And by this point he had torn down her self esteem so much, she thought she was nothing without him.

When he finally got out, she gave up her life to help him. She took him to see his PO, and he pissed dirty every damn time. He spent a weekend in jail and then left. Then he‚Äôd do it all over again. He kept breaking parole. She worked her ass off to cover amenities for him. Drugs, food, and eventually rent when they moved in together. He kept cheating. He was about 19 or 20, and he had sex with a fucking 15 year old. Both corroborated this account. The girl and fuck face.

He cheated so much he caught an STD and gave it to her. She had to get a shot for it. He knowingly gave her an STD. He also raped her several times through coercion and she told me a few times she woke up with him on top of her. She would say fine just to get it over with. He would strangle her during these rapes, to the point of passing out and having seizures. I don‚Äôt know how often it was consensual. She said having sex with him hurt her.

There was a night she came over to my place when I still lived at home. Because he had gotten drunk and had beaten the shit out of her. She said she got in her car naked, it‚Äôs hard to think about what events lead up to this. She had some clothes with her. And she stayed at my place for two nights to avoid him. His mother came over the next day after the beating. I don‚Äôt remember everything she said, but something that is seared into my brain forever ‚Äúyou know he loves you, right?‚Äù I hate that woman. Who is herself a battered woman. And she put my friend in danger. I had to go to work the day after the dumb bitch came over. And that woman left my friend ALONE with fuck face. So they could ‚Äútalk it out‚Äù. My friend was thankfully not killed that day. But the possibility was there and it bothered me so much.

It took me nearly two years of tough love to get through to her. No one else, was telling her what she really needed to hear. Which, honestly, pissed me off to no end. We had to take an 8 month break. It was so fucking exhausting constantly worrying about her. 

It wasn‚Äôt too long after this that she finally broke it off with him. This relationship spanned 5 years, one miscarriage and two abortions. She was so thankful she never had a kid with him. But the contact never stopped. She do t cut contact because he threatened her life, my life, her cat, and her family. She felt like she couldn‚Äôt go to the police, because they had been oooh so useful up until this point. 

They had been broken up for about two or so years. He never fucking let go.

There was a day he wanted to hang out, and she didn‚Äôt feel up to it. So that night he came over and busted out her back windshield and slashed all her tires. The police were called and a report was filed. Nothing ever came of it. Then nothing major happened for a while. Until earlier this year. At the end of last year, we moved to another state with his family. Then he decided to come back. And he stalked her relentlessly. Contacted her at 3 in the fucking morning even though she had to work (I didn‚Äôt know this until after everything happened). He would get mad if she fell asleep on him. And he would prattle on and on about useless shit. 

Then the first of February. Her birthday. He apparently tried to get in her car very late that night. To leave a ‚Äúgift‚Äù. Then he tried to get into her car on the second. Couldn‚Äôt, so he left and set an alarm to try again later. Apparently he over slept the alarm. So on the third he finally did what he wanted‚Ä¶ she texted me. Just before everything happened. And I‚Äôm glad I got to tell her I loved her. Something didn‚Äôt feel right about the texts. But I couldn‚Äôt put a finger on it. She told me she was going to her parents‚Äô place to hide out from him. But it haunts me I couldn‚Äôt do anything for her. She protected me in her final moments‚Ä¶

I got the call at about 10:30 that night. I was stressing because the police did a wellness check. They heard she had a roommate so they wanted to make sure I was safe. They don‚Äôt tell me what happened. Because they hadn‚Äôt talked to her family yet. I felt so numb. I couldn‚Äôt eat for two days. Her dad informed me of what happened. And it felt like I was dunked in the arctic water. I felt sick. I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I knew immediately who had done it before anyone told me. It could only be one person. 

I‚Äôm telling you this, because you need to leave as soon as possible. Get help as soon as possible. Go to women‚Äôs shelters. They have advocates there. People that will advocate for you when you go to the police. You need someone to really be there. They can give you all the resources. 

GET THE FUCK AWAY! I mean this with all the love. He doesn‚Äôt fucking love you. He loves an idea. And the second you don‚Äôt fit that idea, the second you show you are your own person. It will piss him off. Control is all he cares about. If he hits you, he will do it again. If he strangles you, he will *kill* you. 

I always knew this was a strong possibility. I‚Äôve never wanted to be more wrong in my life. God how I wish I could‚Äôve take her place. 

She was such a sweet, kind and beautiful woman. I feel so lucky to have spent this time with her. She had the warmest hugs. Ones that you needed no matter how you felt. Her smile could light up a room. Her laugh was so contagious and I found it endearing. She always hated it. She was beautiful inside and out. She was so compassionate, even to those who didn‚Äôt fucking deserve it. I love her. She was like my sister. I wouldn‚Äôt change our time together for the world. But I‚Äôd give my life to bring her back in a heartbeat. 

She never felt safe enough to use her voice. So I‚Äôll be her voice.

Sorry if this is a jumbled mess. I just really need to get this out there. I want her story to be told. I want other people to learn from this. I can‚Äôt stand seeing this shit anymore. This happens all too often. If I can reach even one person. Then I‚Äôm doing something right.

I wanted so badly to be her shield. She ended up being mine. So now I‚Äôll be her sword.",2025-02-23 06:02:57,2025-03-17 16:10:39,strangle
17zwicm,My (30m) fiance shoved and strangled me (28f) during a heated argument because I wouldn't let him leave,papergirl_lemonade,2,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/17zwicm/my_30m_fiance_shoved_and_strangled_me_28f_during/,"We had an argument before he had to leave for work, and I was so upset that I couldn't let him go. I kept urging him to calm down and not leave while we were still in that heated state. Despite my pleas, he insisted on leaving, stating that it wasn't what he needed right then and he had to go. Eventually, I reluctantly agreed, but I emphasized that I didn't want him to depart in anger with unresolved issues hanging in the air. I continued to ask him to calm down, hoping for a reconciliation, and as I moved in for a hug, he shoved me, causing me to fall to the floor.

His frustration escalated to the point where he ended up strangling me. After this disturbing incident, he left, only to return home an hour later without going to work. Throughout the day, he neither apologized nor acknowledged what had happened, choosing to ignore me instead.

I've consistently struggled with giving him space when he's upset during an argument. The challenge stems from the fact that, in those moments, I'm also upset, and what I crave is comfort and a discussion about the issue. I'm even fine with not delving into the details; it's the standstill that triggers my anxiety and abandonment issues. I've communicated to him multiple times that I would be okay if he simply left in a considerate, kind, manner, as it fulfills his need for space without causing additional distress on my end.

This was the first time he laid a hand on me during an argument, though I've been aware of his struggles with anger management, I'm questioning whether I might be to blame for provoking him during such a heated moment. Or for not giving him the space he asked for when he was trying to manage his anger, or if I was being too needy and inconsiderate.

TL;DR: My fianc√© physically assaulted me during an argument when I prevented him from leaving.  Wondering if I was wrong to do so.",2023-11-20 19:22:15,2025-03-17 16:10:40,strangle

Need advice.,Mobile_Sir_4360,7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1aomi1b/friends_aunt_was_strangled_by_husband_need_advice/,"I'm a 20F. My friend's aunt was strangled by her husband in front of their 2 daughters, both under the age of 10. There is a long history of physical, emotional, and financial abuse.

My friend's mom (the victim's sister) asked my mom for her advice. Shockingly, my friend's mom is still unsure whether her sister should leave this nan. 

Initially, my mom said that my friend's aunt must take her daughters and leave. Then later in the course of the phone call, she instead started telling my friend's mom that another good solution would be that their parents (my friend's grandparents) come and live in the home with this man and observe his behavior. Then they can figure things out from there.

I am shocked at my mom's terrible judgement. My own father was abusive and I cannot believe she would recommend that two older people go live with a man that just strangled his wife. I want solutions. Can I call the police in this situation? Anything at all I can do? I don't have proof. 

I am also trying to discuss the urgency of this situation with my mom so if you can share anything helpful, I would appreciate it.",2024-02-12 00:01:41,2025-03-17 16:10:42,strangle

Lately we‚Äôve been fighting a lot because my husband spends some time with a group he  of 3 friend(s 2 women and a men) he just met, and im very jealous of one of the girls , sometimes he stays late to have dinner with just the two women and play some board games . And it doesnt give as time to talk on rhe phone at night, it drives me crazy since im far away from him , but he doesn‚Äôt want to stop seeing them since they‚Äôre the only friends he has now, and all his family is far away inclunding me.
Last time i was with him , things escalated , i got super jealous even tought i trust him and i know he wouldn‚Äôt cheat on me , but i got crazy and told him to stop seeing that girl and he refused , so i started screaming and i broke a vase and threw a chair on the floor, so to calm me , he pushed me on the ground and strangled me a little for a few seconds , a neighbor came after hearing the screaming, he blamed me for making a scene and shaming him with the neighbor who also works with him.
After that i asked him to divorce me and i left the house. ( i had my flight to go back to my city that same day)
It was the first time my husband was abusif physically, he was never abusif neither verbally nor emotionally, he was always so kind , loving and understanding.
I regretted asking him for a divirce since its a word that we agreend to never use, and also making for making a scene
So i came back from the aeroport , didnt take my flight , to apologize and make things right since i was just angry and never meant what i said because i love him and want to spend the rest of my life with him.
When he knew i was coming back he got out of the house and disappeared ( he spent the bight at a hotel) i kept calling a hundred times and sent hundreds of messages he didnt answer i looked for him everywhere.. he only sent me a message saying its over and hes not coming home
I told him to just bring me the keys to our home since i didnt have them but he didnt want to, i end up spending the night at our neighbors house.
I found him the next day, he told me that i crossed lot of red lines, he cannot forgive me right now and needs time, he also blames me for strangling me .
I apologized hundreds of times , and cried and promised to never make a scene or ask for a divorce when i dont mean it
But he wouldn‚Äôt listen
He took me to the aeroport to take the first flight and go at my parents 
He dont answer to my messages , nor my calks its been 4 days , the only thing he said that he would come next week to our city and then he would call me and talk to my parents .. i dont know if he‚Äôs going to announce a divorce to my parents or what
I miss him but im also mad at him for abandoning me like that and not apologizing for his mistakes..
Im sorry its long but i tried to make it the shortest possible

**TL;DR;** :i have a long distance relationship with my husband for 1 years and half, we fight lately a little because of a new  girl friend of his that im super jealous from and he doesn‚Äôt want to stop seeing , i got angry , made a scene , broke some stuff , so he pushed me on the floor and strangled me , then i asked for divorce , now hes mad and even though i regret and apologized he still dont talk to me",2024-01-21 00:22:57,2025-03-17 16:10:43,strangle

135l2vh,"Ever since my husband strangled me, I suspect he does things to mess with me in a way that makes it not seem like it",lifechange4theworst,18,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/135l2vh/ever_since_my_husband_strangled_me_i_suspect_he/,"I don‚Äôt know if this is all in my head or if my husband is doing these things intentionally to hurt me. 

Over a year ago he strangled me to the point I thought I was dead. It was so bad that I had bruising and scratch marks all over my neck and bruises all over my arms and chest. I had dried blood in my ears and blood shot eyes. My tongue felt swollen and I couldn‚Äôt talk properly for days. 

Anyways, he gets in a bad mood whenever I have a flashback or a panic attack about it. It has absolutely traumatized me so much that I get scared out of the blue. I have nightmares often and even wake up feeling like I‚Äôm gasping for air. I have a reoccurring dream where he‚Äôs on top of me with all his pressure on my chest and I can‚Äôt breathe, then I‚Äôll wake up and not be able to go back to sleep. I have always been able to sleep through the night until this happened. 

Whenever he sees that I‚Äôm upset and asks why, if I say it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm having flashbacks, he gets all angry and says ‚ÄúI will kill myself before I ever lay a hand on you again. However, I think he might be doing small things to antagonize me but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs all in my head or what. 

A couple of examples. I get motion sickness. I‚Äôm legally blind and so he drives. Whenever I am sick in the car it always seems like he will go fast over speed bumps, stop really fast at lights and even drives over curbs. All of this of course makes me more sick. I could be wrong but it never seems like he does this when I‚Äôm not feeling sick. He will ask if I‚Äôm feeling sick and if I say no, the drive will be nice and smooth. So, I have started to always say I feel great. I never tell him when I feel ill in the car and try my hardest to hide it. 

Another thing he does is this. He smokes cigarettes and I‚Äôm a non smoker. He smells so terrible after having a cigarette, it is so strong that have a hard time  breathing and have a scratchy throat when I‚Äôm near him immediately after he smokes. I have asked him to wait for a bit before he kisses me after having a cigarette and for the most part he does. However, whenever I get a flashback or am upset about the strangulation incident, he will come right to me after a cigarette and kisses me even if I ask him not to. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs doing this intentionally just to hurt me in a way that makes it seem like an accident. 

Those are just a couple of examples. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just being over dramatic or what, but the timing of the things he does does to me is such a coincidence. 

Is it even possible for someone to become abusive after years of marriage? The first time he hurt me was 7 years in when he punched me with a closed fist. Since then he has grabbed my arms and swung me around, he broke my glasses, he broke my fingers (at least they seemed broken), he‚Äôs grabbed me by the hair, he strangled me and has done some other things. I never ever thought I‚Äôd be terrified of my best friend. He always has this psycho look in his eyes and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm imagining it or what. I have no idea if the small things that don‚Äôt seem intentional are or if I‚Äôm just crazy.",2023-05-02 13:22:18,2025-03-17 16:10:47,strangle

He's mildly crossed the line in the past in the bedroom but I would eventually shrug it off. Last night, he got upset because I asked his friend what kind of cheese he wanted on his dinner but didn't ask my boyfriend if he wanted any (I already put it on his because I know what he likes). When I tried to explain my logic, he mocked me and overpowered me in the conversation. I got upset and raised my voice. My boyfriend said he wanted me out and dumped some sentimental belongings I had in a box on the ground. I told him he wouldn't like it if I did that with his computer. He came over and hugged me but then grabbed my phone out of my pocket and ran away. I was trying to pull it out of his hands but he kept saying ""This is my phone. I pay for it!"" I went in his computer room in rage but with no intentions of doing anything I'd later regret. Thats when he put both hands around my neck and picked me up (he's 6'5, 275lbs, I'm 5'3, 115lbs). Then he tossed me on the ground. He kept applying pressure to my neck, I had to get him to stop so croaked out ""I love you"". He instantly released and I started to have a panic attack. He comforted me and told me to calm down. My ear was ringing and I couldn't breathe. I went in the bathroom and he said that I needed to give him sex to calm down. My back was hurting from him slamming me into the ground. He blocked me in- I had no phone and nowhere to go. I said that's assault and told him to move out of the doorway. He didn't, he stood his ground and said he needed sex. We live in an apartment so I loudly said ""You're forcing me to have sex! Thats sexual assa-"" he put his hand over my mouth and nose, popping my nose. He released his hand and ask ""whats it going to be?"" I went to give him a bj but was in pain and he was mad that I didn't give all in. I tasted an awful taste and spit in the sink. It was yellow... I believe he peed in my mouth.... he then said he didn't and that was his precum. I let him fuck me after that because I felt like I had no other option to get him to comply. He kept saying that he's going to get me off the pill so I can have a baby with him. He pounded me as hard as he could then after he finished told me I had to give him my pin for my phone, otherwise he'd factory reset it by putting in too many false pins. Eventually, I gave it to him but changed it today. I was afraid that he was going to try to kill me in my sleep but emotionally and physically exhausted, so I kept drifting in and out of sleep. He makes a lot of money and says he's going to ruin my life if I ever leave him. He also claims to know a gang and has threatened to have them kill me and my family. Today, he is being nice and I haven't left the bed. He got me to put all of my money in a joint checking account and empties it into his savings, whenever I show signs of leaving. I no longer have a car because he manipulated me into signing it over to his name so he could let his sister use it. I did this in the beginning of the relationship, when things were good. I'm not sure what to do or how to get out. The only thing he has allowed me to have is my phone because he hasn't seen me doing anything bad on it. I also think that he thinks that I am so in love with him that I would never reach out for help. It's difficult to get away... especially, now during the pandemic, since he never leaves the house without me. I've never called a shelter and don't know what to expect from DV organizations.

I haven‚Äôt talked about this much to my friends or anyone really, to the people I‚Äôve told I don‚Äôt think they really understand and so I‚Äôve just kept it all to myself. However this has bothered me for so long and I just want to put it out there. I was in a physically abusive relationship when I was younger he did just about everything- I‚Äôve had bloody noses, fat lips, a hematoma the size of a small orange on my hip, bruises so dark you could see his knuckles in them, stabbed with a pen, ect ect. Anyway towards the end of our relationship he started strangling me, he had done it a few times but always let go.. until one day he didn‚Äôt.. I was on our bed and he was over me and at first I was just like whatever he‚Äôs gonna let go then it was like oh my gosh he‚Äôs not letting go and then it was panic and then it was black. When I woke up, he was in the shower. This is what‚Äôs always bothered me. I don‚Äôt know how long I was unconscious for, I don‚Äôt know what he did when I blacked out I don‚Äôt know if he checked to see if I was alive idk what happened. And so today I started looking up how long it takes to regain consciousness and I read it was almost immediately after pressure was released but when I woke up he was in the shower and he didn‚Äôt know I was up because as soon as I woke up I ran away and had I been awake he would not have left me there alone to decide if I was going to run away or not. He wrote me a few months ago on social media with a very sorry excuse for an apology and since then it‚Äôs been stuck in my mind, how long was I out?",2023-05-09 04:09:12,2025-03-17 16:10:50,strangle
llsudw,He strangled me will he change?,Initial-Net-8964,16,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/llsudw/he_strangled_me_will_he_change/,"Hi all I've never done this before. I'm really looking for some advice. I have been with my partner for nearly 8 years. I'm 27 he's 36. I was very younge when I met him and he was amazing and I quickly fell in love with him and him me. About a year into the relationship we had a argument (can't remember what about) he was trying to get me out of his flat but I refused as I wanted to sort things out. He then pinned me up against the wall and strangled me. After he calmed down he was very sorry and I accepted the apology and he said he would never do that again. 7 years later I can sadly say that simular situations during arguments have happened at least another 6 times over the years most recently in the Autumn so a few months back now. Hes strangled me almost every time, pinned me up against the wall and has slapped me plus all of the awful names I am called ( bitch, hoe, retard) I never fight back or swear I just about raise my voice. I've always known that this is bad and not normal however I think over the years I have become very good at ignoring and blanking out the truth. Since turning 26/27 I've been doing alot of research on domestic violence and have accepted that I am a victim. I wouldn't say that I am your typical victim as most of the time our relationship is amazing and full of fun. However there has been times (roughly once or twice a year) when he's particularly stressed and when an argument breaks out he has become violent. As of recent I've addressed these issues with him and told him that what's he's been doing isn't normal and that I am not to blame for his out bursts. I've told him if it happens one more time then we are done for good. He's extreamly sorry and realises that he's been a monster to me at times. Does anyone here been in a similar situation as me? And can things actually change or am I just wasting my time? Thank you all xx",2021-02-17 11:55:20,2025-03-17 16:10:51,strangle
gge4u8,My husband strangled me,5050Sunnyside,43,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/gge4u8/my_husband_strangled_me/,"Three days ago I got into an argument with my husband, it somehow escalated into him choking me. He lunged at me and choked me. I tried to fight him off, then he picked me up by my throat and slammed me on the floor and started to strangle me. At first I figured that he was going to let me go, but when he picked me up by my throat and slammed me on the floor I instantly thought that he was trying to kill me. 

I then yelled for my eight-year-old son in the other room to run. I thought that if my husband was going to strangle me to death that he might hurt my son. After I yelled for my son, my husband started to choke me again and bash my head on the floor. Our son came into our bedroom and he yelled at his dad to stop, which worked and I was able to back away from him. After he let me go I was going to call my mother-in-law to come pick me up. Unfortunately I‚Äôm much closer with his family than I am my own. On top of that I‚Äôm the only person in my family that still lives city I grew up in. He found me trying to call his mom and told me to stop, I just went with whatever he said because I didn‚Äôt wanna be choked again. I have marks on my throat where his hands were my jaw is swollen it almost looks like I had a wisdom tooth taken out. The rash/burn on my neck stings every time I turn my head. 

We‚Äôve been together for 10 years and he‚Äôs never done anything remotely close to what happened.

pi2bnj,My boyfriend strangled me... and killed off all of my dreams.,Obvious_Course21,22,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/pi2bnj/my_boyfriend_strangled_me_and_killed_off_all_of/,"I'm not really sure what the point of this post is, partly to vent I suppose. Or if anyone has any insights on how to move forward, I'd really appreciate it.

My partner of 5 years and I got into an explosive fight, which resulted in him strangling and choke slamming me in a fit of rage. Everything shattered in that moment. Now I'm beginning the very difficult process of starting my life over. I'm 28f... no children (thankfully). I am in a safe place.

It's a tough pill to swallow‚Ä¶ it sounds stupid, but I really wasn't ready for this. I knew things were bad, but not this bad. After he strangled me, I left in a terrified panic to go somewhere safe, not fully realizing that I would never be able to go home again. Now it's been a month and it's finally sinking in... Nothing will ever be the same. I still haven't been able to go back for any of my belongings... We've made arrangements for me to go and get my stuff when he isn't there, but honestly I can't even bring myself to look at the house without my entire world shattering into a million pieces. It's not fair. The thought of starting over is eating me up.

It all happened so quick, and while it's true that things have been ""off"" for quite some time, I kept trudging forward with the hope that things would eventually turn around. Instead, things turned violent. I gave him every ounce of myself that I had left and in return, he strangled the breath out of me. I don't even know who I am anymore... I feel like I'm nothing. How will I ever find happiness again when my entire identity has been slowly smothered out of me? How will I ever trust again?

Not only do I have to say goodbye to the person I thought I was building a life with, but I also have to let go of my house, my cat, my countryside property, and all of my independence along with it. All of my dreams seem so far away now. While I realize that a relationship, a house and independence mean nothing when you're living in fear for your life, it's still heartbreaking to let go of. The illusion of him loving me has been shattered. So is the hope of ever starting a family. And it hurts me so much that he gets to carry on like nothing ever happened; the only thing he's losing is me.

Meanwhile I have to start my life over. Everything I've been working towards‚Ä¶ everything I've poured myself into‚Ä¶ everything I've sacrificed myself for is dead and gone. It was all for nothing. On top of that, I've become so cripplingly isolated / socially anxious over the years that I don't even know who my friends are anymore, if I have any left. Toss in a pandemic and not having a living space to call my own, and friendships suddenly seem impossible. Nevermind dating again.

While I'm fortunate enough to have a loving and supportive family who are helping me get through this, I'm still finding it incredibly difficult to move on. Nobody knows the full story of what happened, and I don't plan to tell them for personal reasons. At least not yet. I understand the seriousness of the situation and it's becoming clear just how long the (emotional/ intimidating/ controlling) abuse has been going on, so going back is not an option... but it's hard because a huge part of me feels like I still love him and I just want to go home, forgive him and forget it ever happened (I know this is wrong, but it's hard to shake). The other part of me worries that I'll wind up dead. My self esteem is so low, I'm not even sure I care.

He's been pretty cooperative (though a bit apathetic) through all of this and understands why I need to leave, but somehow that's making it harder to let go. The thought of him finding a roommate to replace me is weird. He was never interested in having friends while I was there, but his sudden need to surround himself with friends and invite people over is making me want to go back. I know this is unrealistic, if I went back we would just slip back into isolation and bad patterns all over again. It also makes me wonder if I'm the reason nobody ever wanted to be around us. I just wanted more balance. At this point it's hard to differentiate between the dream and the reality. We've become so intertwined, I don't even know what to do with myself. I'm stuck. It all just seems so daunting right now. How do I move past this? Does anybody have any advice on how to move forward? The anxiety is overwhelming.",2021-09-04 23:46:49,2025-03-17 16:10:54,strangle

7wvo78,He strangled me.,mirrx,12,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/7wvo78/he_strangled_me/,"T and I started fighting about him being on his computer. He had spent his whole day playing video games and I just wanted him to spend time with me. I had been sitting on his couch for hours and hours waiting for him. It hurt my feelings. He told me I was controlling and a shitty person. 

That i didn‚Äôt want him to have friends. The argument progressed into name calling on his side, and I didn‚Äôt want to fight so I just started agreeing with him on the things that he said. 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a bitch‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a cunt‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you mentally retarded?‚Äù
I just agreed. That I am a bitch. A cunt. Whatever. He hates when I don‚Äôt argue back with him. 

He asked ‚Äúdo you remember what happened last time you did this‚Äù, 
Referring to the incident where he almost broke my wrist. When he held me down. Took my phone away so i couldn‚Äôt call for help. That incident was in November. It still gives me anxiety to think about. My wrist still hurts sometimes. 

Mean words were exchanged, he had told me to leave his house so I started gathering my things. I didn‚Äôt wanna walk home so I asked him for a ride. I have lupus. I have extreme pain issues. 
He told me that I need to leave and to walk home. 
He told me that maybe I would lose a few pounds. I told him that this is why he would be alone forever. Because he is selfish and mean and a shitty boyfriend. He told me that I would be alone forever because I‚Äôm such a bitch and so controlling. 

I told him that I could go be intimate with someone later that night if I wanted to. I went to step past him so I could start walking home. He was sitting on the edge of the couch, and I walked around the side. 

He grab my shoulders and flipped me over the couch. My back hit the wooden slats under the couch. He climbed on me, took both of his hands and put them over my throat and started choking me. I could not breathe and I felt my eyes roll into the back of my head. He choked me for about 10 to 15 seconds. I tried to tell him to stop but I could not talk and I could not breathe. He got off of me, and went into the other room. I laid on his couch trying to breathe while crying.

Eventually I got up and started heading towards the door. T started putting his shoes on and said why don‚Äôt we go for a little walk. I told him to stay the fuck away from me and I ran out of his door and down the street. 

I went to my friends house. She called the cops for me. She called the domestic abuse hotline. I wouldn‚Äôt have reported it if she didn‚Äôt do it for me. He‚Äôs been violent in the past but he‚Äôs never hit me or punched me so I didn‚Äôt think too much of it.

The cops came. Took a video statement. Took pictures of my injuries (still have red marks on my neck). The cop went and arrested him. Aggravated domestic battery/strangle. I didn‚Äôt want to press charges. I knew it‚Äôd be hard but i didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôd be like this. More on that in a minute. 

I got an emergency order of protection on top of the no contact order. And I‚Äôm still scared. He knows when my roommate goes to work. And t hates me. It‚Äôs even worse because I still love him. How can you want to be as far from someone as possible and want to be cuddled in their arms. He did hurt me. But my feelings didn‚Äôt just go away. 

It‚Äôs so hurtful seeing the things he posts on social media. Saying this is my fault because I‚Äôm manipulative. And a liar. 

‚ÄúEveryone is giving pity to the 28 year old divorcee with scars covering her arms‚Äù 

‚ÄúBeing a snitch isn‚Äôt a good thing where I come from‚Äù

He seriously called me a snitch because I told the police he CHOKED ME. It doesn‚Äôt just hurt because of the physical assault. The lies he‚Äôs spreading hurt. The way he isn‚Äôt remorseful at all hurts. Saying I deserve it because I made him mad. 

I got drunk and texted him (doesn‚Äôt mess with my restraining order, i checked). And told him i didn‚Äôt want him to go to prison. I wanted to drop the case. I just wanted him to be sorry. He screenshotted the texts and sent them to everyone. I‚Äôm not ashamed of what I said. But then he posted a Facebook status saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre always playing the victim, how much damage are you going to do along the way?‚Äù

He MADE me a victim of domestic abuse. We did fight but he had no right to lay his hands on me. He‚Äôs trying to paint me as someone I‚Äôm not. But he‚Äôs the one with these charges and I‚Äôm the one with a restraining order on him. 

I have all these feelings. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm sorry this post is long. I just needed people who understand what I‚Äôve been through to maybe give me advice or kind words. 


TLDR: ex strangled me and I can barely deal with my life. Looking for advice and positive words.

I honestly feel like I have been in this relationship for years. It started off amazing, my girlfriend was so attentive and sweet. I did find it a little weird that she said she loved me after 3 days, but I guess I just overlooked it and allowed myself to feel special. I ended up being super busy with school in February so I was not able to meet her in person until March. When we met everything was amazing but I noticed she didn‚Äôt recognize boundaries, she wanted to be around me 24/7 and she has a child and she would leave her child to be with her mom. I guess I‚Äôm saying this part because I find it so odd how disconnected she is to her child, she mentions hating being a mom a lot and has revealed that her child is a rape baby. To top it off she also has dissociative identity disorder, which is why I‚Äôm conflicted in my thoughts on her, I can‚Äôt help but feel so bad for her. The first time she grabbed my neck was during a diabetic attack, long story short she was on a big sugar high and was passed out unable to speak and I stupidly forgot how to put insulin on her so I called the paramedics, she woke up around a whole bunch of men paramedics and that triggered her to grab my neck, she said she has no memory of this happening and her other alters don‚Äôt remember either. The second time she grabbed my neck was after I was able to grab my phone from her that she was holding hostage, she said she stopped because she saw where it was going, and shortly after she locked herself in the bathroom and almost tried to slit her wrist but I was able to grab it from , I felt sad because she said she wanted to unalive herself because she grabbed my neck. Today was another similar episode, she got upset because I told her I needed space because her behavior rage was scaring me. I told her to please leave my apartment ( while we were both in the car ) I shorty found out she was not out of my aparmtnet I told her you need to leave she then throws a hamper with hairspray bottle in it right at my head, I lost my temper and I punched her. I really hate myself for doing this, it was weird tho because she started laughing it‚Äôs almost like she liked seeing me that scared. She then grabs my phone and breaks it ( this is the second phone of mine she has broken btw ) I want to break up with her but I‚Äôm scared to. Now she is saying that if I leave her tell the police that I punched her into face. I‚Äôm so terrified. (I also forgot to add she also spit on me today and started laughing, she admitted that she liked seeing how angry I got because she thought it was funny and she said she spit on me because she views me as a piece of shit. I want so bad to help her work through her trauma, she said she will be willing to get therapy and that she will change. I‚Äôm just really scared at what we have both become and I told her I want to break up but she is making it near impossible. Thank you all in advance and I‚Äôm sorry if this triggers anyone.

Well he‚Äôs been hostile with me for months. Dirty looks emotionally draining me & our daughter (3y) gets it too since he does it in front of her. I‚Äôve stayed cause I‚Äôm scared what would happen if I leave, plus I do love him & beg for change. he gets violent when I ask him to leave, or if I talk about how to fix ya, he breaks things, yells & gets in my face. But Nothing that made me frightened for my life, until, two days ago he snapped. He first hit me & my daughter with a silk long pillow hard, knocks my head onto hers hard. We were cuddled about to sleep my daughter & I. Then he gets her (picks her up) , she wanted me, I get her back after begging & told him to go or I was calling the cops. He moved or tossed her off of me onto my legs, it was fast- then choked me with one hand & plugged my nose & mouth with the other. He stopped but I seen black, almost fainted maybe? I don‚Äôt remember it all happened so fast. We are here with him until he goes to work Tuesday, we‚Äôre acting cool like nothing happened & so is he. But I only have $122 & I don‚Äôt have breaks or Ac in car & might need a rotor before I can go. That will break me or might not be enough. But I think if I have a friend help who won‚Äôt charge much- we can make $122 work to Fix it. I need gas to get to either North Carolina to his family who knows everything & will protect me while helping him (he won‚Äôt know I‚Äôm out of our state) or I can go to Florida to my sister & her gram. I just need to pay to get there. Food for Ride, gas & a hotel for a night maybe two depending on where I choose to go. I can‚Äôt knock it out in a day being the only driver. I don‚Äôt know how I can get money, $, to leave by Tuesday when that‚Äôs my only day I can leave in secrecy. Any help to make fast cash will be appreciated & repaid when I‚Äôm on my feet, please no scams. I don‚Äôt want to post all my proof here that includes last names of my family. I‚Äôll scratch last names out of photos. But this is all my life. I wish I was lying. I love him, he is only here for our daughter he does nothing for besides traumatize her. She‚Äôs scared of loud noises & it‚Äôs cause of him. 
Ps getting pfa morning before I leave, I pray i can Tuesday... pray for us please. He takes my phone sometimes when he senses something. So here‚Äôs to making it to Tuesday with a phone & money to leave before he snaps again & doesn‚Äôt stop.

It was only for about 7-9 seconds but it was scary, and I felt light headed as feeck. After, all I could do was cry and really just lay there on the floor. I was still begging him to stay after everything that happened and the day after he told me he didn‚Äôt remember using two hands. He was saying things like ‚Äúyou ran into my foot‚Äù when he clearly kicked me down, it‚Äôs almost a week later and my chest still hurts really bad from it. When I told him that I remembered him using two hands, he told me he wanted to get help and therapy. He never put his hands on me before and I don‚Äôt know why he did this time. I don‚Äôt know if he understood what he could have done by squeezing too hard or for too long, he did look really mad and I don‚Äôt know if he really was trying to kill me, regardless it happened. I love him and I want to try to stay and make it work. 

It‚Äôs been almost a week and he‚Äôs already changed a bit. I can tell he‚Äôs trying and making all of the immediate changes I need him to but I want to know if you think he can really get help for this or if I should leave. He seems like he can change, but he also never seemed like he would be the one standing over me after having just choked me.  He has remorse now but he didn‚Äôt after it happened. He kept saying ‚Äúif I did it‚Äù. Idk. Thoughts? ",2018-10-11 06:18:43,2025-03-17 16:11:07,strangle
a167wf,My husband strangled me. Help,stalkworthybabe,10,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/a167wf/my_husband_strangled_me_help/,"My husband of 3 years and I are on vacation. Long story short, he drank too much, became unreasonably jealous towards an elderly man that was speaking to me at a piano bar, dragged me out of the bar by my neck, kicking tables and screaming at me then went back into the bar and assaulted the old man, who really had done nothing except ask where we were from. My husband took off before police came, leaving me stranded in New Orleans at 1am with nothing but my phone to get me back to our Airbnb. It took me two hours to walk through droves of homeless to get back. He was apparently in a Lyft looking for me so he arrived shortly after I did. In 2 hours he hadn‚Äôt calmed at all and starts demanding I leave. It‚Äôs almost 4 am at this point. I say I will leave in the morning. I‚Äôm just trying to go to sleep now having walked miles and miles back. He starts talking about my adult daughter who‚Äôs living with us, saying he‚Äôs going to throw her out, etc. Mostly I had been trying not to engage him but I had said I wanted a divorce, called him a POS for stranding me in a dangerous city and said I hated him a bunch of times. When he started talking about my daughter I said something like ok here are your true colors coming out. He said he would show me his true colors and strangled me while I was lying in bed. He‚Äôs a big man, 6‚Äô3‚Äù, 320 pounds. I was laying down on my back but tried to turn away as he grabbed my neck. He put all his weight on me and squeezed till I passed out. I woke up thinking I fell asleep to him having me turned on my side trying to revive me. I don‚Äôt have any visible bruising but my left side of my neck is very swollen today under my jaw. Some background about my husband...He knows I was in an extremely abusive marriage previous to him and I getting together. (My ex had to do prison time for felonious assault, interference with emergency services, kidnapping and stalking). My husband now is typically very protective of me. I feel safe with him as a general rule however he does have some issues with anger and previous to meeting me, addiction issues. He‚Äôs never hit me although he has gotten mad and punched walls and shoved me against walls. He‚Äôs done those things stone cold sober usually over small verbal spats that he reacts to way over the top. He‚Äôs never hurt me or made me feel like he would hurt me until last night. I realize he could‚Äôve killed me, very easily. I feel lucky that he didn‚Äôt. He doesn‚Äôt usually drink either. Today I don‚Äôt know what to do. He‚Äôs very sorry and says he‚Äôs never drinking again and I believe he means that. But he doesn‚Äôt see that he‚Äôs had a problem before this by the overreacting he sometimes has over verbal spats. Am I doomed to have to end this relationship? I don‚Äôt know what to do. I love him very much. 

TLDR: My husband of 3 years got drunk and strangled me unconscious now I don‚Äôt know what to do. ",2018-11-28 13:31:37,2025-03-17 16:11:08,strangle

My husband roughed me up about an hour ago. I'm terrified of course to call the police plus I don't want the kids to see their dad arrested. What are my options? Am I able to file a report in the morning? I took a few pictures but my camera did not hold up. I also filmed my husband beating up our roommate for defending me so I would have evidence. I don't know what to do to get us safely out of the house.

So what happened? My roommate and him were fighting in the garage all night long. Husband wouldn't let go of a situation he had no control over and kept trying to drive the same point repeatedly to my roommate. My roommate wouldn't back down so he took out his anger on me and my son by yelling at him and mentally torturing him (at this point anything was setting him off and we were in the way. He went physical on me. I pushed him out of my way twice when he tried to charge at me and bump chest. This led to him feeling like he needed to pyshcially hold me down, choke me and throw me over the bed. 
He was also belligerent drunk and said heinous things that aren't typical of him like calling me a *fat ugly ungrateful dumb cunt* but none of that matters now because. What are my next steps? Anyone get out of a situation they thought was utterly impossible?

Other than this we have a good relationship. He's gone back to talking to me normally and we're still in the same house. I'm worried that I'm dealing with this in a bad way and that it will have a negative long term subconscious affect on me.

5ery7d,He strangled me,Inaverydarkplace,6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/5ery7d/he_strangled_me/,"I live with a domestic partner who has been verbally and emotionally abusing me for 2 and half years out of the 5 years that we have been together/known each other. We met online and now live together. The violence started subtle with him pushing me onto a sofa during disagreements. Over time he would hold me down when he was angry, leaving bruises on my body. He'd shove me and threaten to punch/hit me. He threw stuff at me. He'd block the doorway not allowing me to leave and force me to listen to him. He lied often and couldn't manage his money, bounced cheques and lost our car because he couldn't make the payments. This kept me isolated and unable to work. 

I am estranged from my parents because they were abusive to me. Out of desperation I contacted my mother during violent episodes by this man. But each time she would tell me she doesn't want to hear about my problems. She wanted to enjoy her life. Even when my problems equal being shoved backwards so hard my skull nearly cracks and I injure my neck and break my finger. 

That was the worst incident until he strangled me 2 days ago. He said he did it because I was arguing with him when he wanted to sleep.

He went to sleep and I sat shaking for hours.

I called a DV number. They could barely speak English. They told me I could have temporary shelter but I'd have to abandon my cats. They are all I live for. They are my family. I can't do it. I have no friends. No one I could trust to look after them.

I called my mother again who I hadn't spoken to in 6 months and sent her photos of my strangled neck. The lease is under his name. Calling 911 would make me homeless. She suggested I call my father who I stopped talking to 20 years ago because of physical, verbal and emotional abuse. She said he's medicated now and might have changed. I didn't sleep for two days and went with her to his house (my old childhood home I still have nightmares about) and told him everything. I couldn't stop shaking and crying. I felt extreme anxiety around him. He said come back to the family we will help you. 

They're all abusive in different ways and I don't know what I'm doing. I feel like I've lost my mind. I have no one stable to talk to. No one I can trust. I think there's trauma bonding on some level. Someone please talk to me. Please. I'm scared that I might end up dead or disabled.",2016-11-25 05:22:04,2025-03-17 16:11:13,strangle

He apologized and forced a hug 
Said never provoke me again I may not stop next time so  please don't don't make me do it again  

He is my brother... was my favorite person the one I trusted the most 

I could see the emotional control as part of a fucked up Middle East Muslim culture 
So I tolerated it as much as I could 
I did resist in my own little ways but I knew I am too libral to be accepted 
 So I hide my real self all the time 

It escalated to physical abuse few days ago for the first time from him
Because I was distant and cold for a while and the last straw when I honestly froze and forgot to do a proper greeting to my uncle 
Which is a big no no to disrespect the elders 

But over all a second time - since I was slapped by my other elder brother for demanding to continue college And not be punished by delaying me a semester -


I wonder did I brought this to my self ?
Is it just wise to obey them until I am out 

I wonder if this will happen again every day 

He said I will enjoy hurting you he said I am sorry he cried 
He said sweetie the next day like nothing happened 

Do you leave from the first time you get abused or try to fix things ?

I am already planning on immigration I am an apostate so 
Should I bother to find peace with them 

Left out details . Because I am sleepy but whenever I close my eyes and it's dark I remember the feeling when I hit the floor fainted

7qt553,My girlfriend's mom is going to remarry the man that tried to strangle her,nussthrowaway,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/7qt553/my_girlfriends_mom_is_going_to_remarry_the_man/,"Around August 2016, my girlfriend's dad tried to kill my girlfriend's mom by choking her and attempting to inflict other head injuries. She was sent to the hospital and as far as I know has no permanent/significant damage. There have apparently been other potentially violent incidents of him losing his temper around this time too, and he threatened to kill everyone in the family. Who knows what happened that we don't know about when him and the mom were alone. The dad was jailed and released the same day. I'm not entirely sure of their ages but the two seem to be in their 40s or 50s.

My girlfriend's mom moved out, but for a year the dad still had custody of my girlfriend on weekends. After her mom gained full custody, the dad fought in court to regain custody of my girlfriend but failed. Around this time, including as recent as a few months ago, the dad had a new SO and family. The mom also had a few boyfriends since the incidents until now.

About two weeks ago, my girlfriend's mom went to the dad's house to bring home any stuff she left there. The dad used his car to help return stuff, and since then, the two have been seeing each other again. Now, the dad is almost always in the house where my girlfriend and her mom live and just yesterday the two said they were going to remarry. He promised to my girlfriend that he could be a good dad, but I don't believe him one bit. 

My girlfriend and her sister have desperately pleaded with their mom to not get back together with him but nothing is working. My girlfriend has even been on the floor crying in front of her mom but nothing seems to change her mom's mind. Her mom even told my girlfriend and her sister that she doesn't care about what they have to say at all.

I am convinced they are not getting back together because of financial reasons or because of danger. My girlfriend told me that they were doing well financially, the two had no contact previously, and her dad did not know where her mom's house was before two weeks ago.

What can I or someone else tell my girlfriend's mom to persuade her to NOT get back together with him? What else can be done for her mom, for example counseling, and how can this help be implemented in her life?

Edit: This is not solely about her mom but also my girlfriend and her sister who live in the same house. I was wondering if there was anything that could be done that someone familiar with the psychology of domestic abuse victims would advise me to do. There may not be, but it's worth a try anyway.",2018-01-16 15:46:35,2025-03-17 16:11:16,strangle

We had been at a nightclub with friends, when we got into an argument. I got really really angry and frustrated, so I left and walked around the streets.
Eventually she came out of the club, and I met her out the front from which we got a cab home.
I was being verbally antogonising all the way home, at one point she punched me in the face; giving me a black eye.
Once home, I didn't calm down and after more of me yelling I strangled her neck for about 5 seconds.

I have since been going to counselling and am managing myself much better, however I still carry some anger.

1hnwf53,I'm told I experienced DV but I don't believe it.,anonykitcat,14,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1hnwf53/im_told_i_experienced_dv_but_i_dont_believe_it/,"I contacted a DV text hotline to gain some clarity on my situation because I'm extremely confused about my situation. The last episode had me feeling a lot of panic and anxiety, and I wanted some help sorting out what's happening because sometimes I feel scared even though he has never hit me/laid hands on me.

They asked me a series of questions about various different things, and I answered based on what had happened throughout our relationship. Based on that, they told me I was experiencing DV (they said it is technically emotional/verbal abuse also counts under the umbrella of DV too). Here are some of the things I shared (based on their questions):

* He yells/screams at me when he's angry (and he's set off by very minor things)
* When he's in a rage, he name-calls: a lot of cuss words, insults, and mocking/belittling
* He's thrown things (not aimed *at* me, but within my vinicity) during fights
* He's kicked things, punched tables/walls, and slammed his fists during arguments
* Once when I tried to leave after a bad fight, he put a knife to his throat and threatened to k\*ll himself in front of me saying I'd have to live with theat image in my head and the guilt forever
* He attempted to abandon me in a foreign city without a wallet, keys, or address/directions to where we were staying
* He's woken me up in the middle of the night screaming at me to clean the bathroom
* He's insisting on keeping me awake for hours in the middle of the night to argue/makeup even if I'm exhausted and want to go to sleep
* He tried to guilt-trip me into flying to his country during a war and missile strike (there ended up being a missile strike during the same time/airspace as my flight was scheduled so the flight was cancelled, but before that, he still called me selfish and threatened to break up with me if I didn't come)
* He's complained about using condoms as a birth control method while I'm ovulating, and asked/begged me several times not to until I gave up on it (even though he knows I don't want children right now and was traumatized by an abortion from a similar situation with my ex in the past)
* He makes a lot of jokes about killing/hurting me, almost on a daily basis sometimes. I know he has a dark sense of humor, but it gets a little excessive. He has made a few jokes about ""Gabby Petito-ing"" me. I usually just roll my eyes when he does this. One time I asked him why he made so many of these jokes and he said that he was obviously joking and I was being ridiculous/paranoid.
* He has jokingly put his hands around my neck and pretend to throttle/strangle me. He has never applied any pressure or restricted my airway, but it still makes me uneasy since I was nonconsentually strangled until I almost blacked out during a date once and it was terrifying.
* He likes to rough house when we're playing around...slaps my butt/arms/thighs or bites me a little harder than I like, and when I say ""Ow!"" he'll say I'm no fun because I'm too sensitive.
* Sometimes he gives me hassle about my appearance: tells me I should shave my head, shave my legs, wax, gain weight, wear certain clothes, not wear certain clothes, etc. He never forces me to wear/not wear anything, but sometimes he will complain or argue with me about it.
* He can get very jealous/insecture and has accused me of cheating or planning to leave/breakup with him several times (even though he's always threatening to dump me during our fights)
* He threatens to break up with me/kick me out or use the silent treatment during arguments
* Has made vague comments that sound almost like threats (things like ""You think this is scary, but you've never seen me angry/scary before"" ""Keep acting that way, see where that behavior gets you"", ""You don't want to see me actually mad"", ""I have absolutely nothing to lose in this life. Do you understand me?"", ""I'll tear this entire apartment up if you continue."")
* He's followed me around from room to room to argue/yell at me and sometimes refuses to stop or leave me alone if I'm not in the mood to talk/fight/argue (now I usually leave the house when he raises his voice because otherwise I won't be left alone)

I'm having a hard time understanding this all. I know a lot of people would say that his behavior is unhealthy and toxic, but It's hard for me to believe that this could be DV since he has never physically harmed me (and he's also promised that he would never lay his hands on me and thinks that men who do physically hurt women are terrible).

We have been in a relationship for about 2 years and have a beautiful 1 year old son together. The verbal abuse started when I was pregnant with my son around my second term. The physical abuse didn't start till after I gave birth to my child. He strangled me , smacked me and called me horrible names. Has pulled out weapons on him (in-front of our son as well). I have reported him in the past (twice) for his abuse and my guilt has taken over and I have dropped the charges.

I finally reported him last Friday . I went into the station because once again, I was being verbally abused in public (many people in NYC mind their business) so, no one helped, He had stalked me all the way to school. It got extremely heated he started pushing me around and tripping me and as well as pulled out a knife on me and threatened to harm my mom. I decided to take out my phone to record and he snatches it out of my hand and takes off running. I call 911 to report my phone stolen and the police showed up and I just broke down and told them everything I have been going through with this person.

Today 2/12 . He was arrested. I should be happy. I should be able to take a breath of fresh air so why do I feel like I am drowning. I threw up my breakfast once they told me they have him. I want to say somethings about this man (not to make you have sympathy) but it's good to mention. He has severe mental health issues. I don't think he understands to the full extent what's about to happen to him or what he has done. This is why I feel extremely guilty. I feel like I have handed him over to a system that I know is not built to protect him or help him. He is a black man with mental health issues , I know inside the system he is not going to get the support he needs and that makes me sick to my stomach. I have begged and pleaded for him to seek professional help and take medication if needed but he never does or lies about going to therapy to try and get me back. He also doesn't have any family to support him either , he does not get along with his family. His family is basically where he works. He got arrested in-front of his peers and bosses. I feel like I have ruined his life.

How do I stop feeling this way? Has anyone reported their abuser and felt this way before? I could really use advice. I am terrified I will repeat the cycle of dropping the charges when the district attorney calls me.",2025-02-12 15:54:37,2025-03-17 16:12:30,strangle

14. He got physical with me when I told him I needed him to help me with chores and bills.
15. Broke his own ankle in said altercation, forced me to call out of work to take him to the hospital.
16. Got fired as a result of calling out of work (that specific day was cited, I had previously missed a good bit of days because my grandma died and my mom has a stroke).
17. Found out I was pregnant with his offspring 2 weeks after losing my job, didn‚Äôt force me to get an abortion this time but I was scared so I did (in a 6 week state, had my abortion at 12 weeks).
18. Verbally abused me, taunted me, and physically hurt me or damaged property after I got fired because I couldn‚Äôt find another job.
19. Quit his job knowing we have no way to pay our bills now because he is ‚Äútired of working and taking care of me‚Äù.

Which honestly, I was making a very secret plan to leave him once I got a job and had some disposable income anyways. I guess this just fast forwarded that plan for me. I don‚Äôt know why I haven‚Äôt left yet, I think I wasn‚Äôt strong enough before. I don‚Äôt have any family to lean on, and my only friend who could help is half way across the country. I don‚Äôt care anymore, I‚Äôm gone. I‚Äôll figure this out. I have finally DECIDED it, I never solidly made the decision before. But I can do this, I can do this and I can keep my pets through this. I will provide for them and make sure they‚Äôre okay too. Then I will do the same for myself, FINALLY. 

The relationship is done in my head, but I am still terrified of him so it‚Äôs just my own little secret for now (and I guess Reddit‚Äôs), on the surface it‚Äôll be fine. I‚Äôll keep it going for now as long as I feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù until I can get out of this lease and get into a new one. ",2024-10-23 05:03:57,2025-03-17 16:12:32,strangle
1iwrwwi,he tried to kill me today.,ParamedicCapable5653,22,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iwrwwi/he_tried_to_kill_me_today/,"I joined this group months back when he first hit me. It was helpful to read stories and know im not alone in this. Recently things have been worse. A couple weeks ago, a domestic violence case was opened on us due to a fight we had. He told me hed change, so i pushed for the charges to be dropped. In the state im in, they dont leave it up to the victim to press charges it goes to the state. Eventually after about 5 days it got dropped due to insufficient evidence and i took him back. Last night, he was upset i was watching something kicked me off the bed. he hadn't hit me since the incident so i went and locked myself the bathroom so it didn't escalate. He started hitting the door putting holes in the process. He calmed down after he seen what he had done and we went to bed together without further incident. The next morning I woke up to him kissing my cheek. He then went to kiss my lips and i was laying on my hair so i moved my head to get it out of the way to kiss him and he got upset because he thought i was dodging the kiss. He then went to start packing, and went to the kitchen to get water. I followed asking why he was leaving me and explaining why i moved my head. As i said that. he was sipping the cup of water and threw it all in my face. I then began to cry and told him if he really wanted to leave he could and i didn't try to stop him because of our previous history with the police. I was afraid of a case opening again because i pushed for the other one to be closed. I started to help him put his things into the pile he had going which upset him. He grabbed me and threw me onto the bed, beginning to strangle me. After a while of me trying to fight back, he then grabbed a throw blanket i had on the side and started to suffocate me with that. I wriggled my way out from under him onto the floor. Once on the floor he continued to try to choke me/suffocate me with the blanket. He then attempted to shove my hair down my throat. While doing so I bit his finger. He then tried to shove the blanket down my throat. At some point, i managed to roll onto my stomach. He then started to elbow me repeatedly in my back. I got myself up into a sitting position and tried to get near the door. When i was by the door, he tried to choke me from behind which got me back onto my stomach becayse i was trying to avoid his hands on my throat. He grabbed a boot of mine and hit me in my head. He then found a heavier platform boot i had and struck me in the head repeatedly with that boot. I begged him for water and eventually he got up to get me water. During this time i grabbed my phone and ran to the door. I accidentally twisted the deadbolt the wrong way which alerted him and once i got the door open he had me by my arm. i fell onto the ground and kept trying to use my foot on the doorway as leverage to get away. Eventually, because i was screaming for help, he let go of me. I ran and found an officer who was dealing with a different matter in the complex next to mine. Im sitting in the ER right now just in utter disbelief that someone who claimed they loved me could attempt to take my life. 

Update: Thank you guys for the love. Upon being discharged from the hospital, my papers said thankfully i only sustained a sprained hand and concussion. This morning waking up i am in severe pain all over my body. Hes in jail for domestic battery by strangulation and domestic battery 1st degree. I hate to do it to him, but he didn't hate to do what he did to me so i guess i cant be too upset. Im going to request a protection order today and probably seek therapy. I am beyond lucky i survived this. ",2025-02-24 02:53:32,2025-03-17 16:12:34,strangle
1j9g263,Is Empathy that hard?,MistakenlyMustard,6,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j9g263/is_empathy_that_hard/,"I really just need to vent. 

I just escaped a years long relationship where strangling was the go to abuse. Which, through the police and therapy I‚Äôve learned is the type of abuse that more often than not leads to homicide so I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm out.

But I digress. 

I had to do a larger than normal grocery run, and I am now a single mom so obviously I needed to bring my son. I‚Äôm in a location that the only family around to help watch him is my ex‚Äôs family so that was a no go.

So, due to previous experiences, I HAD TO put my son in the main compartment of the cart. No if, ands, or buts, it had to be that way for my freshly out of trauma, single mom brain to not have the hell raising toddler in the middle of a grocery store screaming that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to sit there‚Äù and ‚Äúlet me go‚Äù for an hour, which garners aggressively judgmental looks. And the 10 trips we‚Äôd taken previously were without incident simply because I let him sit in the bottom part of the cart.

As you can tell, this one was NOT without incident, but I did not know that at the time. 

To my surprise, my son and I completed our entire grocery store shopping experience with joy and random sing-a-long‚Äôs and queued up to an empty cashing lane, to which I was met with, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have your own bags, do you want some but you‚Äôre going to have to pay for them‚Äù to which I met with a ‚ÄúI have my own bags!‚Äù But then looked into the cart and realized all of my items were on top of them so I had to empty the cart (that still contained my happy son) onto the conveyor belt to get to my reusable bags. 

She huffed and puffed, refusing to scan a single item until I had reached the bags, whilst I‚Äôm apologizing profusely, calling myself stupid, and she‚Äôs just huffing and rolling her eyes. 

I have everything finally precariously placed as my son looks on in wonder as I rip the bags out from under the last remnants of the items we had joyously gathered together. 

She finally slacks and asks me to donate $1 to whatever charity, at which at that point I went ‚Äúsure, whatever, that‚Äôs fine‚Äù in hopes she‚Äôd be somewhat less hostile. 

However it continued and she demanded all the items in the bottom of my cart have their barcodes pointed upwards so she didn‚Äôt have to help, so‚Ä¶.without realizing my son was standing up at the end of the cart, I pulled the cart towards me to adjust and then everything went slow motion.

I see my toddler toppling backwards out of the cart, back of the head into the floor. I‚Äôm trapped in the cash out lane between my cart, the person behind me and that damned conveyor belt. My eyes go wide, my son is screaming, I can‚Äôt reach him, but by the grace of god, the teen in the next lane over can reach him and lifts him into the cart so I can reach him. I hold him, he‚Äôs crying, and I realize she‚Äôs 4/5 through my order so I tell her to finish because I won‚Äôt be making this trip again and refuse to restart it the next time as I was checking over my son.

She‚Äôs huffing and puffing all over again, muttering how I should just leave and go to the ER. I already KNEW my night would be spent in the ER, but what SHE didn‚Äôt know is that I had been previously trained and worked as an EMT, so I knew 1) he didn‚Äôt loose consciousness, 2) he wasn‚Äôt vommitting, and 3) he was completely coherent and acting like my simply shocked from getting hurt son. So finish my order, we‚Äôll check out, I‚Äôll frantically drop it at home and grab all the things I need from home to make him comfortable because I know ER visits aren‚Äôt quick and let me go.

So I finish finally, and walk out but a lady from inside chases me down and reminds me to do an incident report in case he‚Äôs more injured than expected. 

I may seem apathetic rn but I was in a horrored shock during all of this. I was beating myself up over finishing the order, over moving the cart that caused him to fall, over being the horrible mom that let him in the lower part of the cart instead of dealing with the screaming for strapping him into the child safe seat. I was horrified. 

But I walked back in with him to do a quick report before the long night ahead. 

To his credit, the manager was so sweet, he was helping me fill it out as my son kept stating how he hurt and had a headache and I sped through the paperwork. But then SHE walked up and went ‚Äúwhy the hell is she filing a report?!‚Äù She turns to me and goes ‚Äúyou know it‚Äôs YOUR fault this happened right?‚Äù
I said ‚Äúyes, that‚Äôs what I was finishing writing in the report, so don‚Äôt talk to me‚Äù
She continued about how I was going to try to sue the grocery store and I was a bad mom‚Ä¶..and to be honest, the thought NEVER crossed my mind to sue because I was simply filing the report so it was there and SHE is the one that made me want to. 
She kept spouting about how I didn‚Äôt care about my son and finally the manager came back with my copy of the report and I left.

 Luckily, after spending almost 7 hrs in the ER, we found out he‚Äôs ok. Which was made easier from the stop at home to get his favorite plushies and tablet and snacks. Obviously if he had been worse off I would have dropped everything and ran out of the store with my son to the hospital. 

But right off rip she was a dick for no reason, then attacked me afterwards. 

My philosophy is that you never know what someone is going through so why treat people like shit right off the bat. You literally have to earn my ire. 
I shouldn‚Äôt have to enter an establishment and go ‚Äúhey, my child and I were abused for years and just got out of it and I have trauma disassociation and memory loss so if I don‚Äôt react appropriately to traumatic situations, forgive me‚Äù.

Ps, talked to her corporate office and stated that I would never want anyone to lose their means of income and maybe just do some training on customer service and empathy.
Because there was no reason for her to run up as I‚Äôm making a report as I‚Äôm basically crying and telling me it‚Äôs all my fault and telling me what a horrible mother I am because my son fell out of a shopping cart.",2025-03-12 09:23:08,2025-03-17 16:12:35,strangle

1iy5b45,My Victim Impact Statement.,mrsskreatz,28,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iy5b45/my_victim_impact_statement/,"I hope this is the right tag. I wasn‚Äôt really sure what to put‚Ä¶ My ex husband‚Äôs parole hearing is coming up and I am giving a victim impact statement. I had one written up but it was 6 minutes long when I timed myself and it has to be under 3 minutes. I‚Äôve condescended it down to this:

Victim Impact Statement

To the parole board,

[Ex husbands]‚Äôs violence stole my sense of safety. I still wake up from night terrors, screaming, ‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs here.‚Äù Even in sleep, my mind believes I am in danger.

I once thought drugs caused his violence, that if he got clean, he would change. But I now know the truth‚Äîdrugs didn‚Äôt make him this way; they only made him worse. [Ex husband] is dangerous. Whether sober or not, I fear him.

I was 18 when I started dating [Ex husband]. He was 25. He reminded me, when we‚Äôd fight, that I was ‚Äúbasically a child‚Äù‚Äînot to protect me, but to control me.

[Ex husband] strangled me countless times over the course of a year after we got married. I remember the panic, the way my body fought for air, the marks that weren‚Äôt just bruises‚Äîthey were imprints of his fingers wrapped around my neck, lasting for weeks. The pain lingered long after the bruises faded.

I remember how he put a pillow over my face and punched it repeatedly, how I screamed for his brother who was in the room next us for help but no one came. Then I remember, looking in the mirror, my face covered in blood, and seeing the anger in his eyes as he took my phone, snapped a picture, and told me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never call the cops on me. Here, I‚Äôll take a picture for you to prove it.‚Äù As if my pain was something he needed to document‚Äîas if it was proof of his control.

One time, he threw me into a wall so violently that I hit my head, leaving a large bump on my forehead. His children were in the next room. Another time, he stomped on my foot so hard it left deep bruises, making it unbearable to walk.

Once, I hid in a closet. He dragged me out and later told me I should have stayed‚Äîbecause I was so ugly. He also called me ‚Äòugly fatness‚Äô and told me that if I just stopped eating, I wouldn‚Äôt be that anymore.

He took off his belt and beat me with it. 

I was so afraid he would kill me that I kept pictures and videos of the abuse‚Äîevidence, so people would know what happened if I didn‚Äôt survive. That was my reality. I had to think about what people would need to see if I didn‚Äôt make it out alive.

The last time he was arrested, he had stolen my car. When I found it, it was filled with meth, needles, and spoons.

Even after I left, he refused to let go. He called me constantly. He threatened that if he can‚Äôt have me, nobody can.

[Ex husband] has also threatened my husband, [current husband]. If he is released, my family will be in danger. I don‚Äôt just fear for myself‚ÄîI fear for my husband, my child, and the life I have built away from [Ex husband].

I have spent years recovering from the trauma [Ex husband] inflicted on me. I have worked to rebuild my life. I am finally safe, finally surrounded by love and stability. But I will never feel truly safe knowing he could be free. I have a daughter that I must protect. 

Even if he leaves me alone, I fear for the next woman. I fear for anyone else who gets into a relationship with him. The cycle of abuse does not stop without true accountability, and I have seen no evidence that he has changed.

I am asking the commissioners to take my story into consideration. This is not just my past‚Äîthis is my present. I live with the impact of his violence every day. My trauma is not a story‚Äîit is my life.

[Ex husband]‚Äôs freedom cannot come at the cost of my safety, my family‚Äôs safety, or anyone else‚Äôs.


Is this good enough? Does it show the horrible impact he‚Äôs made on my life? I guess I‚Äôm just looking for help, maybe reassurance, and support. ",2025-02-25 20:44:13,2025-03-17 16:12:37,strangle
1i9f5pl,"PFA filed, cops on alert...I am ""free,"" but afraid",MakeWayForWoo,4,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1i9f5pl/pfa_filed_cops_on_alerti_am_free_but_afraid/,"I wasn't entirely sure how to flair this post, but this one seemed most appropriate. I am finally free...but I am also afraid.

Today I went to the family courthouse to file a protection from abuse order against my ex-partner. I got there at 11:45am (their posted hours are 8am to 2pm, and I had to take a few hours off work to go there), but they had already stopped intake for the day and told me I had to come back at 8am on Monday. If he does try to come for me between now and then, I have the option of filing for an emergency order of protection at the criminal justice center. I truly hope it doesn't come to that because I fear for my life and I don't think I will survive another violent confrontation. (The cops, who I mention further down, told me that in order to qualify for an emergency order they ""usually look for whether the person has been threatened with a weapon."" I was like, does a broken candle jar count? My ex has never used or needed weapons to assault me. He was a power lifter in prison and his *body* is a weapon.)

I live alone in a studio apartment; the lease is in my name only. However, he knows where I live, and knows the code to the front door of the building. (Even if he didn't, other tenants often leave the door ajar.) I have a spare key to the apartment and I do not know where it is - he may or may not have it. He trashed my place last night. I'm headed back there now to sort through the wreckage and hopefully find the spare key. That would actually be a huge win for me.

However, because he knows my daily schedule, and that schedule does not vary, I am afraid he could potentially stake out my apartment building and simply wait outside for me to either return home at the end of the day, or leave in the early morning. I know a determined person is hard to stop, but I would feel a little more comfortable if I could install a small security camera outside my building - and ideally also inside the building, facing my apartment door - so I could check it before I walk out the door. I also would like to ask my landlord to change the locks on my door.

Mainly I feel very scared, and very alone. I am estranged from my family and my only ""real life"" friends are my coworkers. I did inform my boss about the PFA and the whole situation, and my workplace security guards know that the ex is trespassed from the premises. Of course, that wouldn't stop him if he was truly determined to harm me.

I won't go into war stories or the details of the abuse, but needless to say he has physically assaulted me and threatened to kill me on dozens of occasions over the last 3.5 years. Early this morning, after he'd been awake smoking crack all night, he punched me in the head and in the stomach, and threatened to ""kill [me], [my] friends and [my] coworkers if there are any repercussions from this"" (i.e. the assault). He threw a space heater onto the bed (trying to catch it on fire? who knows), flung me literally clear across the room from one wall to the other, then smashed a large candle jar in the kitchen sink and threatened to stab me with the big shards of glass. He pushed me onto the floor, climbed on top of my chest and strangled me with his bare hands until I was nearly unconscious, chanting ""You're gonna die now...you're gonna die now."" He's choked me so many times that I eventually learned how to use my legs to throw him off of me, and I was able to get to my feet long enough to grab my phone and my wallet and run.

He also claimed to have a gun in his jacket pocket, but I actually think this was a lie intended to scare me. That said, while I don't think he has a firearm *now*,, it would not be difficult for him to obtain one as he has numerous connections in this city's crime scene.

After I managed to get away from him and out of the apartment, I knew he would follow me out the door, so while he was putting on his jacket and shoes, I actually ran outside and hid inside the ""utility shed"" outside my building which is literally used for trash cans. It was around 5:30am so although I could see out (this shed is built from 4x8s with large gaps between each board wide enough to look out) it was too dark for him to see in. After about a minute and a half I saw him walk slowly out of the building. He looked around and then just casually shuffled down the street like nothing had happened. After I was sure he was gone, I ordered a Lyft to work and jumped in that car smelling like garbage.

On my way home from work today, I arrived home to find him waiting for me. As soon as I saw him I did a 180¬∞ and started power walking back towards the nearest above-ground subway station - I could hear him yelling after me, saying ""I'm not leaving"" and threatening to track me down. I called the police from the subway station, explained the situation and asked for an escort so I could get back into my building. It took them about a half hour to show up, and I stood out in the freezing cold waiting for a squad car to pull up. When we all got back to my place, he was gone. They took my details, made notes of the injuries to my face and the damage to my apartment, and gave me a report number.

He eventually came back a couple hours later (it's 11pm now, so this was around 8pm) but by this time I had packed his few remaining belongings and his medications and placed them outside my door. I have three locks on my door, a basic doorknob lock, a deadbolt, and a sliding chain lock. If he did somehow still have a key, the chain lock would have been all that was stopping him from kicking down my door. But he didn't even try, aside from a few kicks to the door. After about 10 minutes I convinced him (through the door) that it would be better for him to leave before I called the police. I *didn't* specifically tell him about the PFA, but I did tell his mother, and he'll find out from her soon enough.

Fortunately (or unfortunately, since my workplace is my only real safe space) I have off tomorrow...so I can spend the day cleaning up the destruction he caused. Part of me feels relieved, because he actually *left* when I told him to leave - but, intellectually, I know this stage of things is the one that is most fraught with danger. His drug use is what really makes him unpredictable, and I truly believe he is capable of killing me as long as he is actively using.

I know this probably sounds pathetic but I would really, really like to talk tonight or tomorrow, to literally anyone...I'm really fighting to not go into turtle mode and just retract into my safe space and isolate. It doesn't even have to be DV-related talk...just talk.",2025-01-25 04:35:11,2025-03-17 16:12:41,strangle

im a trans gay man, my abuser was cis and ‚Ä¶idk bi or maybe just gay. (not really sure because he said he was bi when i met him and was still with his baby mama but later started implying he was just gay. but that could‚Äôve just been him saying that to throw me off the idea of him cheating on me with a woman.) doesn‚Äôt really matter either way ig, but it adds this whole extra layer to the abuse he put me through

whenever i started acting a way he didn‚Äôt like (like, showing emotion or asking him to give me basic aftercare, how fucking dare i) he would start saying im acting like a ‚Äúfemale‚Äù. 
in the aftermath of strangling me he told me he ‚Äúnever would have put his hands on me if i was a female‚Äù

its so obvious he only saw me as half a man at best. a weaker, inferior version of a man that he could rationalize and justify taking his anger and violence and aggression out on but was still ultimately beneath him, because of my femininity.

the first two months of our relationship were spent with him hiding me from everyone in his life. partially because he was cheating on me and his baby mama at the same time, and i think also partially because he was ashamed to be seen with me. even in places where nobody knew him, nobody would recognize him, he would make me wait in the car and go into shops alone. 
eventually he did make a point of introducing me to some of his coworkers but i honestly think the only reason he did that was because he ended up breaking up with her at some point (thats a whole other can of worms i dont want to open) and was trying to like. idk prove himself to me or something. it felt like the biggest deal in the world at the time but it probably meant nothing to him. 
he never took me out on a date. not once. he promised me he would. he always swore he would. but he never did. it was never important enough to him to make the time so it never happened. or maybe he just didnt want to be bothered or didnt want to be seen with someone like me in public. 

its just so hard. especially when he made a point to always use my correct pronouns and name. as he‚Äôs getting arrested, he calls me his boyfriend to the police. i wonder sometimes if he said that because he knew my mom could hear everything from the other line of the phone call, or if that‚Äôs how he really saw me. i guess it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference either way. its so hard to feel like i‚Äôm finally seen and desired and loved for who i am just to have it all ripped away from me and it just be a facade. i thought for once someone loved me FOR ME, not in spite of me. i‚Äôm not convinced that love will ever find me. it was supposed to be him. i was supposed to be his handsome boy i was supposed to be his boyfriend, his fianc√©, his husband. he told me once i was the cutest guy he‚Äôd seen in the world and he wanted to be together forever. how can you say everything i‚Äôve ever wanted to hear from the same mouth that drips such cruelty and venom for my very identity and soul? 

i feel so alone and isolated in this experience in general, but it just compounds so much more when nobody i‚Äôve talked to really understands or seems to care that queer and trans people get abused too 
its like we don‚Äôt matter at all
the police and courts have misgendered, disrespected and dismissed me every step of the way no matter how many times i correct them politely 
its exhausting 

i just want someone to understand what i‚Äôm going through. the severity and intensity of it all. how deeply it affected every aspect of my personhood, my identity, my life, my personality, everything. i feel like a completely different person and i‚Äôll never be the same. and nobody understands that. 

my parents expect me to be able to act rationally, logically, patiently to emotional situations but i can‚Äôt do it anymore like i used to. it all just comes out, i have no impulse control anymore when it comes to being triggered. its like i can‚Äôt stop myself from doing or saying things. and i know a lot of it isnt exactly easy for them to deal with and my mom has been patient but its almost like they expect nothing to have changed. and its so hard to feel that pressure to act ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and over it and hold it together and patient and the strong one for everyone else when i just want everyone to be strong and patient for me for once in my life.

I'm no longer with this person, we had plenty of issues and situations, I still struggle to even wrap my head around what all in our relationship was domestic violence. This is an event from time before we were together.

So he lived at his parents with his girlfriend. One day he strangled her, until she blacked out. When us, his friends, heard this story he never said it was his fault or that he did something wrong. They did call the police, he spent night in the cell, to calm down as he said.

He blamed this event on his depression and her passive aggressiveness. Always. Only once did he show any shame or guilt about it when he was absolutely broken and crying about what a horrible person he is.

Yet, the weird part and the part I'd like your opinion on. His parents were absolutely fine with her not pressing charges. Now knowing my own parents if I had been him they would have pressured her to press charges.",2025-02-18 10:53:26,2025-03-17 16:12:47,strangle

They‚Äôve asked me to write a victim impact statement, and I‚Äôm feeling‚Ä¶ conflicted.

Part of me really hopes he‚Äôs changed. He had a severe drug problem, and while that doesn‚Äôt excuse what he did, it was a huge factor in his violence. When he was using, he was paranoid, angry, and unpredictable. He strangled me multiple times. He broke my nose, my foot, and tried to break my arm. The last time he was arrested, he had stolen my car, and when I found it, it had meth, needles, and spoons inside. I‚Äôve done a lot of work to move forward, and I truly hope that prison has given him the space to get clean and become a better person.

But the other part of me‚Äîthe part that lived through it‚Äîworries that he hasn‚Äôt changed. Even after he was incarcerated, he called me 20 times a day, even when I wasn‚Äôt answering. That obsessive, can‚Äôt-let-go behavior is what scares me the most. If he gets out and relapses, I‚Äôm terrified he‚Äôll fixate on me again. And the thing is, I know how his mind worked back then. If he convinced himself that if he couldn‚Äôt have me, no one could‚Ä¶ well, that‚Äôs a possibility I can‚Äôt ignore. I have a family now. A husband. A baby. And the idea of him coming back into my life in any capacity makes my skin crawl.

I guess I‚Äôm struggling with what to say. I don‚Äôt want to be vindictive. I don‚Äôt want to assume he hasn‚Äôt changed. But I also have to be honest about the very real danger he posed to me‚Äîand could pose again. I know the parole board isn‚Äôt looking for my personal feelings, just the facts. And the facts are that I barely made it out of that relationship alive.

Has anyone else been in this position? How did you handle it? I feel like I have a responsibility to protect myself, but I also don‚Äôt want to live in fear forever.",2025-01-31 21:26:14,2025-03-17 16:12:48,strangle

It‚Äôs the last day of Strangulation Awareness month, and I‚Äôve been trying to come up with some easy ways to convey the difference between ‚Äúchoking‚Äù and ‚Äústrangulation‚Äù and encourage using the correct terminology. 

Choking refers to airway obstruction. Think ‚ÄúBig Banana‚Äù. 

Strangulation refers to pressure applied to the neck that blocks the flow of blood and oxygen. A highly gendered and highly lethal act of violence, often used by men against female intimate partners, manual strangulation is preferred by criminals who so desperately need to feel like they are in control that they will seek to manipulate and dominate anyone and anything in their lives, and using their hands to control whether you take another breath is worth the risk that you might die right then and there. 

Think ‚Äúsmall banana‚Äù. 

A miserable, inadequate, and dangerous small banana who is 750% more likely to murder the partners they strangle. 

Using the correct terminology and knowing how dangerous strangulation is will save lives.

* Got together when I was a 17-year-old traumatized girl with no low self-esteem and he was a 22-year-old man who also had low self-esteem
* He was apparently a recovering drug addict
* A couple months into the relationship he found me self-harming. He grabbed me by my hair and called me a ""stupid F-B""
* I tried hard to clue people in on the fact that he put his hands on me but everyone loved him so much it would have been hard to convince them
* He got me pregnant shortly after. I didn't think it was ""that bad""
* While I was pregnant, there were ""fights"" we got into, where somehow I became the one who was at fault
* I'd be the one apologizing, whether he grabbed my hair, pushed me, or emotionally abused me.
* I usually fought back because I was taught during childhood that if I don't fight back it's my fault if I get hurt
* After many, many fights, I accepted that it was just all my fault.
* Was grateful that he kept ""taking me back"" every time
* My dumb (at the time) self kept being so happy every time we got pregnant
* I was sold on the idea that one day this magical fairytale ending would happen and we'd all be okay
* He has not had a job longer than 6 months
* I haven't been on dates, don't get birthday or Christmas or Valentine's presents
* have all been homeless, whether we were living in shelters or on someone's couch or floor.
* I had an income (SSI from severe depression/PTSD due to abuse in childhood)
* Any time we did manage to get a place, we had to leave (without getting evicted) because the little $900 a month wasn't enough to support a family of 6.
* Pregnant with my youngest, he strangled me and told our 3-year-old son, ""Mommy needs to die""
* When the cops came that day, I didn't want him to get arrested, so I said that nothing happened
* He told me the scratches that were on him (which were from me fighting for my life), were from me randomly attacking him
* I got arrested for domestic abuse
* He has done this to me twice.
* It's been 12 years with this man.
* I am sick of him. All I can do is lay around and feel hopeless whenever I'm around him which is all day every day since he doesn't work
* my hair had fallen out due to stress
* Everything just sucks and I have contemplated suicide to escape
* In September I found out he was texting girls again, he actually got caught texting a girl right across from me sitting at the kitchen table on my 30th birthday.
* I have texted men before after these fights and expressing that I'm done with him, yet not being able to leave due to not having the money. I have always been honest and haven't hidden this.
* Every time I tried to leave I had to leave my own home because he wouldn't leave even though his name has never been on a lease
* I don't like the idea of calling the cops and having them rip him out of the house to be on the street as nobody really wants anything to do with him due to his ways of always asking people for stuff and never offering to help anyone
* I usually have to leave but then he calls me crying saying he has changed, and my children are usually sad to be away from their dad, whether I take all 4 or only 2 and leave 2 with him
* It sucks and I don't know what to do.
*  For the people who ask why I kept having kids with him, I listened to his false promises of a better future. I was a naive kid myself. 
* I LOVE being a mother and away from this stuff, my kids and I are VERY happy and satisfied with one another. I am a person who loves kids. This is not debatable. I would have had this many or even more, but wish I wasn't naive and planned better.
* I am a full-time student.
* We are not married.

I (24F) was in an on and off again relationship with my ex (26M) for roughly 10 years. I met him when I was 11 and he was 13 and we continued dating/communication for all those years. In April of 2021, he was released from prison for minor charges after spending 4 years there (we talked, wrote letters, and used Jpay every single day). In May he moved in with me. I got him a job at the company I worked for, I believed he was clean and sober, and he even eventually got himself a room that he rented in a house with 4 other guys. Sometimes I would catch him in ‚Äúlittle white lies‚Äù or what I assumed they‚Äôd be, but I always called him out and he would sometimes apologize. Other times, though, he would fly into huge fits of rage where his eyes would just go black. One of those times, he pinned me down and strangled me until I passed out, but when I woke up he was gone completely. The next day he came home to apologize and brought gifts. It was a cycle. He would continually rape me while I was asleep, piss on me, and hit me constantly. It eventually came to a head when he gave me chlamydia and I brought it up to him - where he promptly blamed me and moved out the same day. A week or two later, I got a message from a girl (24F) stating that they have been in a relationship for over a month at this point and that I needed to stay away from him, which I had no problem doing. A few days after that, she called me threatening to beat my ass and accusing me of all types of things. It was crazy, but I gave her my address and was kind to her, knowing what he did to me & how he was. She came over while I had a new guy over (lol yikes) and we sat in my bedroom and talked for hours. She even complimented one of my pillows, saying she had one just like it. I told her was his - turns out it was HERS. She and I bonded and talked about his BS, and when she left, it was as we were newfound friends. 6 months then pass, I‚Äôm in a new, healthy, loving relationship and he begins texting me in the middle of the night. I tell my best friend (25F) and she promptly texted my exes new girlfriend to tell him to leave me alone. This solved the problems for a little while on my end. I would periodically check on the girlfriend on FB & IG to see if they were still together, and about a month ago I saw she was pregnant, but also posting ominous things about drugs ruining people, wanting to be loved properly, and wanting peace. Turns out, she filed a DV case against him. He was doing the same thing to her as he did to me. I knew immediately. I got a text from my best friend last night and she was missing and he was on the run. I knew then and there it was him. Well, they found them both today. He was trying to get a bus pass at a homeless shelter, and she was in a garbage bag in a dumpster in a bad part of town. I feel so guilty, I can‚Äôt believe this is happening. My exes face is everywhere (I live in a bigger city) and I cannot escape it. My heart hurts for this sweet girl and her family. My heart hurts because I didn‚Äôt do more. I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt eat, I can‚Äôt even bring myself to shower. My best friend had to come over today because I can‚Äôt even be alone. I keep having panic attacks, I can‚Äôt get it out of my brain. I‚Äôm reliving the trauma all over again. I know it isn‚Äôt about me, but the what ifs keep going through my head. I should‚Äôve helped her. It should‚Äôve been me. How do I cope? I feel so entirely guilty. ",2024-07-04 00:35:53,2025-03-17 16:13:02,strangle

He made her change her number and I don‚Äôt have the new number.  Even if I did- it‚Äôs no use.  He reads and controls all forms of communication- her Facebook, phone, email, everything.  
I can‚Äôt just show up at her house, he will meet you at the door with a gun if you do.

I turned 20 three weeks ago. This is gonna be long story but it‚Äôs just something I can‚Äôt seem to get over I just keep replaying what happened in my mind over and over. 

Let me start with the backstory. Me and my husband got together when I was 18 and he was 21. I‚Äôm now 20 and he‚Äôs 23. I got pregnant and had a baby with him when I was 19, my son is now 1 year old and we got married when I found out I was pregnant. Over time in our relationship things just got worse and worse. At first it was just arguments and then it turned into yelling at each other and then over time in our relationship it turn into him throwing and breaking things and then finally the hitting came. I still stayed with him even after he hit me, idk why but it my mind I thought it would be the last time and I didn‚Äôt wanna give up on him because we had a kid together and I thought he was changing but then a month later he would hit me again. Things eventually got so bad a week before my birthday we decided to divorce but we were still living together. And also during all of this our son was living with his parents because of all the violence. After we decided to get a divorce he started drinking a lot going out to bars until 2am, going on tinder talking to other women, he started demanding I still cook for him and do his laundry because we still live together and when we were sitting next to each other he would look at models and OF girls on instagram and say stuff like ‚Äúgod damn‚Äù ‚Äúmmm so hot‚Äù very loud so I would hear . He started giving me hell after we decided to divorce, he would do things like show me pictures of the girls he was talking to, before he went out to bars he would dress up super nice, shave, put cologne on and would ask he how he looks. I tried my best to stay calm because I knew he was just trying to get a reaction out of me. He even went as far as when we were sitting next to each other he unzip his pants and started jerking it off to random girls profile pics on tinder right next to me to try and get me jealous. And it‚Äôs gets worse so let me tell you about my birthday 

The day before my birthday arrives he promise even though were divorcing he would still take me out to have fun on my birthday and buy me cake. And the reason why I was gonna celebrate my birthday with him is because my family lived across the country and I have no friends. I didn‚Äôt wanna be alone on my birthday so that‚Äôs why I asked him to at least give me a nice birthday while we‚Äôre separating. Well it‚Äôs the night before my birthday he goes out to a couple of different bars and he comes home at 3:30am the early morning of my birthday. When he walks into the door I can tell that he is extremely intoxicated, he could barely walk and had dried up vomit on his beard. He starts telling me happy birthday while stumbling into a wall and I tell him to just leave me alone I don‚Äôt wanna talk to you right now because of how drunk you are. Then he starts cussing at me calling me names.

Now this is the part when it gets really bad, my memories is honestly kinda blurry from what happened and I can‚Äôt remember well the order of things happening and some spots in my memory are just completely blacked out because of how traumatic it gets but I‚Äôll try my best. So anyways, I remember while we were arguing he started yelling and I tried walking away from him and he followed me and the next thing I remember is he grabs my phone and smashes on the phone over and over again until it‚Äôs into pieces. Then i remember after he smashed my phone he started yelling in my face ‚Äúfuck you bitch, fuck your phone, who are you gonna call now to save you no one‚Äù. I was crying hysterically and asking him why he would do that. Then I remember I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in and he follows me and grabs the key to the door and I tried my best to hold the lock still but he‚Äôs 250lbs and 6‚Äô1 and I‚Äôm 112lbs and 5‚Äô3, so he easily overpowers me and opens the door. He pushes me into the wall and asked me what my problem is. I‚Äôm crying and I‚Äôm begging him to leave me alone because I‚Äôm about to have a panic attack and he takes out his phone and starts recording me thinking it‚Äôs funny that I‚Äôm crying and starts yelling look at this bitch crying. I then run and try to grab my laptop to try and text my family or anymore to please help me. He then sees that I grabbed my laptop and he puts his hands on my next and starts choking me and he yelling at me ‚Äú drop the laptop and give it to me and I‚Äôll take my hands off your neck‚Äù.  After that it just gets blurry so the order of things happening is probably off. But this goes on for 4 hours and I remember him picking me up and slamming me to the floor and while I was on the floor he takes his boot and stomped on my ankle. I remember him slamming me into the dresser a few times. I remember him taking my laptop putting it up in the air and threatening to slam it over my head and he does slammed it to the floor and I quick run out the way so it didn‚Äôt hit me. I remember he strangle me a second time, I remember his hands around my neck and he kept putting more and more pressure on my neck I could start to feel myself loosing consciousness and getting dizzy and I think he started to feel my body becoming limp that he finally let go of my neck and I fell to the floor for a second and it took me a minute to regain full consciousness. I remember in the middle of this I tried running to my car and I get into my car and he grabbed my purse with my keys in it and wouldn‚Äôt let me leave and then grabbed my arm and dragged me back inside and btw we live on 200 acre ranch that he inherit from his family, so no there was no neighbors houses I could run to we lived out in the middle of nowhere and the closest town is 20 minute drive away. I also remember him yelling I‚Äôm gonna fucking kill you a couple of times while this was going on. 

So now I‚Äôll tell you how it ended, well when he wasn‚Äôt looking. I quickly grabbed my old iPhone 8 from middle school that I still had and plugged it in behind the couch where he wouldn‚Äôt see. It took about an hour for the phone to finally turn on because it‚Äôs a very old phone. I grabbed the phone and went to the other room and locked myself in. Even though the phone didn‚Äôt have any cell service, I was still able to call 911 on it. He hears me calling the police and he runs out the door and runs deep into the ranch to hide. The police finally arrived after 15 minutes I told the police what happened and they get a k9 unit to find him. They book him and arrest him at 7am in the morning of my birthday and changed him with assault on family member, breath/circulat, and interfere with emergency request for assistance. They set his bond for 60,000 and he‚Äôs looking at about 6 months to a year in prison. And they put a protective order on me. 

The  morning of my birthday I didn‚Äôt go to bed at all. I texted my mom and dad about what happened on my old iPhone 8 and they sent me money to go and buy and new one and I spend the whole day of my birthday trying to figure what to do about my phone and laptop he broke and I couldn‚Äôt log into my Apple ID because it wanted to send security code to the my phone number and my phone was shattered and I went to AT&T to try and get my phone number back after I bought a new phone but because I‚Äôm under his AT&T account and I‚Äôm not an authorized user I couldn‚Äôt get my phone number back and I lost all the data from my phone. I lost all my newborn pic of my son, my birth photos, all my logins to my social media accounts, and all my contacts, texts, everything. Right now I‚Äôm still living in his house while he awaiting trial, I was financially dependent on him but I‚Äôm looking for a job to move out and get an apartment before he gets out.

I logically know abuse happened because he decided to abuse me. I know that there was no version of him that did not abuse me. 

But there is this fairytale land that existed throughout the relationship and is trying to suck me back in where he was the fun, loving, sweet person he sometimes was, all the time. Where he wasn‚Äôt Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Where he never yelled, hit, gaslit, strangled me, where he didn‚Äôt punch holes in my walls and smash heaters and break into my house.

She‚Äôs strangled did it in public and did it even though my mom was on the phone (previously she had stopped when my mother got involved). My mom only seemed to make her more aggressive. We actually weren‚Äôt even together when she did this , I had broken up with her a week prior but I was weak and let her come to me. She grabbed me by my hair first, pulled me to her side (drivers seat) and punched me over and over. I had to fight back, the best I could from that position. This was maybe the first time i actually feared for my life. I blacked hits with one of my arms and tried to fight her off with the other. She didn‚Äôt stop. She finally did when I resorted to hitting one of her fingers and that‚Äôs when I think my flight or fight kicked in. She got arrested a bit later and I‚Äôve felt guilt. I still feel things and for some reason I just don‚Äôt want bad things to happen to her. The other part of me wonders how she only got third degree, maybe I just don‚Äôt understand what that means. But she prevented me from leaving the car, she pinched me over 20+ times, ripped my hair out, cut me with her nails (I have evidence of it) and she only got third degree. Maybe it‚Äôs because I lied on the questions they asked me (like if she‚Äôs three‚Äôs to k word me).

The nose bleed this weekend (time of the violence) lasted me hours. We have a non contact order by the state but it‚Äôs so weird how I feel.

I know what she did was wrong and I know it‚Äôs happened more than once (not as bad as this time), she‚Äôs left me with a black eye, she‚Äôs tried to strangle me and even the things she said were awful.

Examples of things he said that made me realise how pathetic he was:

- When he heard about Croatia, he asked ‚ÄòWhat is that‚Äô

- He believed all laws are unnecessary and that the government should be changed into a private-run company.

Now, Two years later, I've come to the realization that I was in an abusive relationship with my ex. Around the same time, a few girls reached out to me asking about his suspicious behavior. I had started posting on my Instagram story (about 5 posts in one month) hinting that my ex was emotionally manipulative during our relationship, saying that other women before and after me accused him of rape and assault, and sending people a synopsis of his actions to me in private messages when they reached out. 

This morning I got the message that he killed himself. 

6 days before my birthday. 

While I'm on a trip in the city we last took a trip to together before splitting. 

I'm going to leave out the details of my emotions, but just know this has absolutely destroyed my soul and will affect me for the rest of my life. 

Today Someone sent me a message of a screenshot of him saying how I single-handedly ruined his entire life and he knows how happy I am about it. My logical mind knows it's not my fault. He has had mental health issues for many years that he never addressed. I tried my best to help while we were together. I got him free therapy at my job, called 988 a few times with him, and hid all the knives in the house after he locked himself in the bathroom with one. I never ever brought him down, I would do my best to shower him in compliments constantly to try to lift his spirits when he was sad, because I genuinely loved him at the time. I only held him accountable for his abuse against me. 

I don't know yet if he left a note or anything. someone messaged me already how I pushed him to do this with and should feel guilty for destroying so many people's lives. His sister left me a pretty nasty voicemail  sarcastically asking what he did to abuse me and to ""have a nice fucking life"". I even got a nasty email from my ex gf that I haven't spoken to in 5 years. These imply to me that he left a note blaming me. None of these people know my side. Everyone else Ive talked to who knows my side has been telling me not to blame myself, and deep down I beliebe that but the guilt I feel is overwhelming right now.  I just know there's other people out there who think that I intentionally pushed him to do this. 

I have a lot of support from family and friends and already contacted my therapist to start sessions again the day I arrive home from my trip. 

I don't know why I'm posting this, I guess for advice and to vent and to see if anyone has been in a situation like this before. Thanks for reading.

But yesterday, I went on what might have been a date but might not have been (a guy I'd met through a meetup group I'd joined inivited me out with him, just for a walk) and I caught myself really  pining for my ex again. Only for the really loving side he had in between episodes where he'd wake me up stroking my hair with a cup of coffee or orange juice and run me baths for when I got home etc and the mug he got me for valentines day with a picture of us on. I know it sounds silly, but I've never had any other exs do those nice, loving things.

Then I started spiraling wondering if I'd made the right decision to leave and whether his reactions to minor things really were that over the top or if I just overreacted to his reactions and threw away what we had with all the lovely stuff in between.


He'd throw a strop over stuff like:

I left a knife and fork in a takeaway box
 
I left a juice carton on the table

I threw away a disposable wrapper

I paused to give way to traffic, which had right of way (he often wanted me to push in and risk an accident for the sake of not having to wait 30 seconds)

I forgot to put onions in a sandwich 

Things being out of place (e.g., a mug or a torch, and then the accusations that I'd stolen them would start when I didn't even know these items existed, let alone where they go, or where they've ended up)

I accidentally took the wrong exit at a roundabout (it only took about 2 minutes to turn around

I used a urine sample pot that was identical to all the others by mistake when that was 'his' one from the doctor (they were all completely indistinguishable and I always have some in the house as it recurrent uti and kidney infections and they were next to each other, there was absolutely no reason he couldn't have used one of the others)

Dropping things

Spilling things

I knocked over a glass of Pepsi, which was left on the floor

Not hanging his T-shirts 'the right way' on the airer (I could never remember what the right way was supposed to be, who even has a right way to do something so mundane and inconsequential?)

Forgetting to take the laundry out

I ate the last piece of bread and forgot to buy another loaf (apparently this warranted waking me up at 7am on my day off to go out and buy more for him, instead of doing so himself or just having something else for breakfast)

I didn't wake him up for an appointment that I didn't even know he had (he had an alarm clock, btw)

I didn't give him a back massage at 11pm when I had been up since 6am, ram a metric marathon race, and had to get up early for work the next day

There's so many more examples 


I was just wondering who can relate? Is this a common tactic to make you walk on eggshells? Was I overreacting when I got upset that he was shouting at me, accusing me of not caring about him?

1i7v41h,My Abuser Was A Mr. Sensitive.  I Promise You They Are Just As Destructive As Any Other Style Of Abuser,MissMoxie2004,234,92,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1i7v41h/my_abuser_was_a_mr_sensitive_i_promise_you_they/,"So I‚Äôve seen a few posts on here coming from abuse victims who are a bit confused about what‚Äôs going on. They know their partner makes them feel overwhelmed and suffocated but otherwise don‚Äôt know how to describe what‚Äôs happening.  I recognize these thoughts and patterns.  What these victims are dealing with is a style of abuser Bancroft labeled ‚ÄúMr. Sensitive.‚Äù

I won‚Äôt elaborate, but I will paste the passage on Mr. Sensitive from Why Does He Do That below.  My abuser was a Mr. Sensitive and I promise you they are just as destructive as any other style of abuser. 

Also, feel free to ask me ANYTHING

Mr. Sensitive from Why Does He Do That 

Mr. Sensitive appears to be the diametric opposite of the Drill Sergeant. He is soft-spoken, gentle, and supportive‚Äîwhen he isn't being abusive. He loves the language of feelings, openly sharing his insecurities, his fears, and his emotional injuries. He hugs other men. He may speak out about the absurdity of war or the need for men to get in touch with their feminine side. Perhaps he attends a men's group or goes on men's retreats. Often he has participated extensively in therapy or twelve-step programs, or reads all the big self-help books, so he speaks the language of popular psychology and introspection. His vocabulary is sprinkled with jargon like developing closeness, working out our issues, and facing up to hard things about myself. He presents himself to women as an ally in the struggle against sex-role limitations. To some women, he seems like a dream come true.

So what's wrong with this picture? Nothing obvious yet. But this is exactly the problem: Mr. Sensitive wraps himself in one of the most persuasive covers a man can have. If you start to feel chronically mistreated by him, you are likely to assume that something is wrong with you, and if you complain about him to other people, they may think you must be spoiled: You have the New Age man, what more do you want?

The following dynamics are typical of a relationship with Mr. Sensitive and may help explain your feeling that something has gone awry:

You seem to be hurting his feelings constantly, though you aren't sure why, and he expects your attention to be focused endlessly on his emotional injuries. If you are in a bad mood one day and say something unfair or insensitive, it won't be enough for you to give him a sincere apology and accept responsibility. He'll go on and on about it, expecting you to grovel as if you had treated him with profound cruelty. (Notice the twist here: This is just what an abuser accuses his partner of doing to him, when all she is really looking for is a heartfelt I'm sorry.)
When your feelings are hurt, on the other hand, he will insist on brushing over it quickly. He may give you a stream of pop-psychology language (Just let the feelings go through you, don't hold on to them so much, or It's all in the attitude you take toward life, or No one can hurt you unless you let them) to substitute for genuine support for your feelings, especially if you are upset about something he did. None of these philosophies applies when you upset him, however.
With the passing of time, he increasingly casts the blame on to you for anything he is dissatisfied with in his own life; your burden of guilt keeps growing.
He starts to exhibit a mean side that no one else ever sees and may even become threatening or intimidating.
Mr. Sensitive has the potential to turn physically frightening, as any style of abuser can, no matter how much he may preach nonviolence. After an aggressive incident, he will speak of his actions as anger rather than as abuse, as though there were no difference between the two. He blames his assaultive behavior on you or on his emotional issues, saying that his feelings were so deeply wounded that he had no other choice.

Many people reject the possibility that Mr. Sensitive could be an abuser. I ran into this disbelief one weekend when I was leading a training course on emotional recovery, as I periodically do. My workshops focus partly on the healing effects of crying and so tend to be attended by more women than men. The males who do come have included many of the most wonderful men it has been my good fortune to know, as well as a handful of the biggest manipulators. A few years ago, a participant named Deanna approached me anxiously before a workshop. She explained that an ex-partner of hers named Brad had called her a few days ahead of the workshop to tell her he was attending the same weekend. She was uncomfortable and told him that if he showed up she would leave. He promised not to bother her, though, and said he would not bring up their relationship in any way. He was coming with his new girlfriend, which eased Deanna's worries.

I spent some time talking with Brad as the workshop was starting, without mentioning Deanna, and he seemed likeable, kind, and‚Äîwhat can I say?‚Äîsensitive. However, I observed within a few hours that he was in fact speaking to other people about his past with Deanna and getting them riled up about her running away from their unresolved issues. On Sunday morning, he finally provoked a scene about their relationship in front of the full workshop, which was humiliating to Deanna.

The story does not end there. I called a break, and took Brad aside. I told him that it was my understanding that he had agreed not to raise these issues and that it had become obvious to me that he had come for the weekend with the intention of doing precisely what he had promised not to. I went on to point out that he had taken Deanna's weekend away from her and that I considered this kind of power move to be abuse, especially since it was directed at an ex-partner.

Saying the word abuse to an abusive person can be like lighting a tinderbox: When you name the unmentionable secret, he goes wild. Brad got loud, rolled his eyes at what a hysterical exaggerator he considered me to be, and adopted a victim stance, saying, I beg you to stop this. Then came the most important part: He said in a screeching whine, I have only put a hand on a partner once in my life, many years ago, and I just barely pushed her away from me like this‚Äîand he shoved me hard by the shoulder‚Äîafter she called my mother a sick woman.

Well, why was Brad denying a history of assault (while actually admitting to one) when I hadn't said anything about violence? The possibility that he might be physically abusive had never occurred to me before, but it certainly did now. The signs were all there: bullying Deanna that weekend and then insisting it was for her own good; feeling entitled to ignore an important agreement; blaming his earlier girlfriend for his assault of her and minimizing it‚Äîthe strength of the shove he gave me would have shaken up most women. I now doubted that the assaultive incident he had described was his only occasion of physically intimidating a woman.

At this point I required Brad to leave the workshop. I then had to deal with a mini-insurrection from some of the other workshop participants, who couldn't believe I was ejecting this gentle man who was so in touch with his feelings. He cries after all; how could he be abusive?

This gentle man style of abuser tends to be highly self-centered and demanding of emotional catering. He may not be the man who has a fit because dinner is late but rather erupts because of some way his partner failed to sacrifice her own needs or interests to keep him content. He plays up how fragile he is to divert attention from the swath of destruction he leaves behind him.

The central attitudes driving Mr. Sensitive are:

‚Ä¢ I'm against the macho men, so I couldn't be abusive.

‚Ä¢ As long as I use a lot of psychobabble, no one is going to believe that I am mistreating you.

‚Ä¢ I can control you by analyzing how your mind and emotions work, and what your issues are from childhood.

‚Ä¢ I can get inside your head whether you want me there or not.

‚Ä¢ Nothing in the world is more important than my feelings.

‚Ä¢ Women should be grateful to me for not being like those other men.",2025-01-23 04:13:52,2025-03-17 03:19:15,abuse

I (33F) am married to Rob (35M), and we have two kids‚Äî6 years old and 4 months. Rob has struggled with keeping a job for most of our 7-year relationship. He has an average job tenure of about 6 months before something happens‚Äîusually an issue with a boss or coworkers‚Äîthat leads to him losing the job.

At the beginning of this year, Rob was unemployed, so he went to a remote northern community for work, leaving me at home. He tried to convince me to move there with him because he found a job he liked, but I refused. I was pregnant, didn‚Äôt want to move for his job, and our daughter is settled here. On top of that, our relationship wasn‚Äôt great. While he was away, he didn‚Äôt send any money home for the house or our kids.

Rob moved back home in August, and in September, he started a new job where he makes decent money. Since then, he sent me $600 from his first paycheck and $300 from his second. This doesn‚Äôt even come close to covering his portion of the bills. I asked him how much he was making so I could calculate his share, but he refused to tell me.

A little backstory:
I was up all night (til 7am) like I am often because we have puppies and senior dogs that need frequent potty breaks and attention. I also have schoolwork to do and chores and maybe even a little me time that I can‚Äôt get during the day because my husband is always there and has high demands of my time. 
He works 530am to 4pm and wants dinner at 4 everyday. Then he usually falls asleep by like 6pm and wakes up around 12-3 am. I‚Äôm expected to make sure he has food and be up to let him hang out with the dogs and etc. 
We live in a house with my mom and sis, and he stays exclusively in his office or our room. He has a micro and fridge and etc. in his office and I keep him stocked up on food. (Soup. Sandwiches. Cereal. Oatmeal. Burritos. Yogurt. Water. Coffee. Drinks. Etc.)
Because he needs to sleep and the dogs are not prone to follow his schedule of sleep, I‚Äôm up u til he wakes up in the am and then usually have to make him food and etc. then I get to sleep. 
Last night I got to sleep at 7am. He was sleeping on my pillow and blanket and sprawled across our king size bed and I couldn‚Äôt even sit down. I tried to wake him enough for him to move but he didn‚Äôt. 

I explained all of this to him when I woke up at TEN AM. For my religious meeting. Afterward I made him some food and etc but I was SO tired. I have health issues and the stress is killing me. When I woke up 2pm he was pissed at me (it‚Äôs his day off and he was playing video games. )
 
So I cried and slept alone for about an hour then I went to Panera to study and get out the house (which he had told me I should do before he got mad at me)

1hcxvf1,Is my husband abusive?,ExcitingNews8170,35,169,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hcxvf1/is_my_husband_abusive/,"We are so in love. He is perfect (or as close to perfect as one can be) and my absolute dream man. I know he is my one true love, and I am his. He does everything for me and you can tell this man is head over heels for me BUT there is one issue that always make me doubt. I would say it's like 2% doubt and the 98% is just me knowing he is the man for me and he will change.

We've been together for 2 years now and whenever we fight and he gets triggered by me he punches wall so they breake, he has even broken his arm over punching a wall at home, thrown his suitcase at me outside, grabs  me very hard and I have ended up with sooo many bruises on my arms and legs because he pinches me really badly. He throws me around and is very aggresive, screaming that he will kill himself over me one day.

Everytime he comes near me face during his attacks I cover my face with my arms and this triggers him even more, he screams that I am overreacting and that he would never hurt me.. And this is his reaction when I trigger him. They way I trigger him is by either being quiet and giving the silent treatment or running my mouth and say bad and triggering stuff.
Whats shocked me the most was when he did this at his parents house, we were in the bedroom me and him, and I was 6 weeks pregnant (one week later I got an abortion) and he was screaming, grabbing me hard, shaking me and just being scary and aggressive. 

Afterwards he is super ashamed of his behaviour, and says that I deserve better and that he will be better for me. He says that he will go to therapy but haven't found a good therapist yet. He also ordered a book online (self-help book on aggressive behaviour) but he haven't even read it yet. He always say sorry afterwards and I know he means it. Everything just turns black for him and I am not an angel myself. I do trigger him badly sometimes with my mouth or just by giving the silent treatment. 

So he is the man I want, I am super obsessed and in love with him. There is no one else. And no I am not blinded by love and blablabla, but it's this small 2% doubt that I can't get over. He is abusive, and I am scared that if he don't change, and we have kids together I would die inside if he did this. I don't even have a question, I just wanted to let out my 2% doubt.

Also, everytime he becomes this way it's because I trigger him, he never does this out of the blue. It happens maybe 2 times/month, sometimes more depending on how much I trigger him.

Also, I'd like to add that he says that what trigger him also is that I don't give him a response with the silent treatment, and that emasculates him and he feels worthless and less like a man. So he does it for validation. We have talked about why he does it and I understand why.",2024-12-12 22:56:36,2025-03-17 03:19:32,abuse
1aujxi7,I left my abusive husband...only for him to get full custody of our kids...,boudiccathequeen,302,194,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1aujxi7/i_left_my_abusive_husbandonly_for_him_to_get_full/,"I need to get this off my chest as I am struggling big time emotionally and mentally. 

During our marriage he would often say to me ""you can never leave me because I'll never let you take my kids or my house"" (our kids, our house).

Well two years ago I left, he was arrested for three different domestic violence charges. He wasn't charged in the ends as there was not enough ""physical evidence"" (even though I had audio recordings etc).

Nevertheless I remained hopeful,  I started to rebuild my life with our two young kids, age 3 and 4 at the time. I work as a teacher and wanted to relocate 30 miles away to my workplace and for the kids to attend the school I teach at, so I'd be close by at all times. I filed for custody and permission to move their school. I had faith that the system, the family court,  would protect me and the kids.

I was wrong. I have endured two years of hell concluding in the worst outcome imaginable. Firstly my ex became intentionally unemployed,  so then he did not have to pay child support. Secondly he persuaded various neighbours and ""acquaintances"" to spy on my daily activities,  and report back to him. Thirdly he coerced the social worker/custody evaluator/CAFCASS  into believing that he was the true victim,  and that he had been the ""main carer of the kids"" since birth. He maintained contact with the custody evaluator via text message for the past two years, building a rapport with her. I was told not to contact her. When she visited me, she accused me of ""not trying harder to save the marriage "" She wrote her report entirely in his favour, and painting me as a cold hearted ""career woman"". 

Needless to say, I could not afford legal representation.  I was offered legal aid due to DV but because I'm a teacher, they said I earnt ""too much"" and asked me to pay a huge lump sum each month, indefinitely.  I was forced to decline.
Therefore,  I didn't ""play the game"" or have a ""strategy "" as my ex clearly did. Because he made himself unemployed,  he received legal aid! Just imagine... an abuser gets funded by the government!!!

As we approached our final hearing,  he breached the restraining order I had against him. He was found guilty and sentenced.  Not to prison,  unfortunately,  just community service.  The police were concerned about my safety due to ongoing stalking and harassment. He lost his gun license.  Various other things. 

Final hearing happened two weeks ago. He was cool as a cucumber. Played the game, said what the judge wanted to hear. I was very anxious and emotional.  The female judge took a shine to my abuser,, infact I don't think she bothered to read any of my evidence.  She said my ex husband was correct as describing me as ""inconsistent and erratic "". (Because I'd been crying). I realised she was now taking the side of my abuser. He was a master manipulator after all. 

Judge ruled that the kids will now live with him full time, and must not move schools. So I have had my babies taken away and put into my abusers hands. I see them once a fortnight.  I facetime them and he's there holding the phone  watching them. The kids look exhausted,  scruffy, dirty and confused. They are quiet. Like they've been told not to say certain things. I spoke to the school and told them my concerns but the school just say ""oh they seem OK at the moment. "" What nobody understands is that all the abuse my ex perpetrated was behind closed doors. I know for a fact its only a matter of time before he has another violent outburst. 

So that's that. I don't know how or when or even if I'll ever get my babies back. My abuser was right when he said if I ever left him, he'd never let me have the kids or the house. I might aswell have just stayed and endured the abuse.

If you got this far, thanks for reading.",2024-02-19 10:09:19,2025-03-17 03:19:34,abuse

She said something that I think is so important and wanted to share.

‚ÄúI think that was the thing that I didn‚Äôt expect was how totally convinced he was of his own victimhood‚Ä¶ I know him well enough, in spite of feeling like I didn‚Äôt know him at all, but I know him well enough to know, he‚Äôs not an actor, he‚Äôs not a performer. He [is] not a great liar in a lot of ways. So I was looking at someone who was actually suffering and I thought if he‚Äôs being manipulative, I‚Äôll know it, because you know, I‚Äôll smell the bullshit‚Ä¶ But I don‚Äôt think he was putting on a performance. I think he genuinely believed I was torturing him. He told me one day I was terrorizing him because I was just crying because I couldn't pretend that things were fine anymore. And I just started crying and he screamed in my face, you‚Äôre terrorizing me. But it was truly from the place of a person who believed that they were being terrorized.‚Äù 

I thought it might resonate with others who have experienced something similar. It‚Äôs not always someone who‚Äôs putting on a performance or who is deliberately lying and gaslighting you, sometimes people really do believe what they are saying and have an incredibly distorted view of reality‚Ä¶ and of course, it‚Äôs still abuse‚Ä¶ but I think this realization can make it a little less confusing when you‚Äôre trying to identify whether it‚Äôs abuse or not, and/or when you‚Äôre trying to make sense of their behaviours. 

Edit: This came up in the interview when Anna was talking about how she really started to wonder if she was the problem, and it was really unexpected that he truly believed it and the things he was saying to her.",2024-10-24 04:21:22,2025-03-17 03:19:36,abuse

His main problem behaviors were: constant false accusations, threats, threats of suicide and self-harm, projection (accusing me of hating him, wanting someone else, wanting him to cut himself, etc), dumping me aggressively then begging me to come back over and over, trying to humiliate me to friends, smearing me to others, sending relatives after me to attack me, making provocative comments just to upset me, extreme hot-and-cold behavior, swearing at me, telling me to cut people out of my life, pretending to be dying to manipulate me, being manipulative in other ways, having rage episodes and extreme breakdowns when not getting what he wanted (he would pull knives on himself and stuff like that), irrational paranoia about other people's motives, lack of accountability/blaming other people for his own behavior, guilt-tripping me (especially when I said no to sex or tried to communicate), vindictiveness, and general entitlement.

I posted a text string on AITAH asking if I was in the wrong for what I said to my boyfriend after he ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù money from me without asking. I didn‚Äôt think the convo was so bad honestly, but all the comments were telling me he is gaslighting, manipulative, etc. Heres that original convo: https://imgur.com/a/hJVfNjK

My ex husband was mentally and physically abusive, so I guess even if my boyfriend is gaslighting or whatever, it‚Äôs been better than what I was dealing with before. But I think everyone‚Äôs answers on my last post opened my eyes, and I‚Äôve been trying to pay extra attention to his potential manipulation. So today we had a conversation that I felt was way worse.

I was working, and he suddenly texts me accusing me of breaking the battery charger for his power tools. I didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about. I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time I even saw a charger of his much less touched one, so I thought he was saying that I came in contact with it very recently and did something to break it. Turns out he was accusing me of breaking it whenever I possibly unplugged it from an outlet in the kitchen, took it off the kitchen counter, and set it in the garage. He often leaves things on the kitchen counter that don‚Äôt belong on the kitchen counter, and he knows how much it bothers me because I hate the clutter & try to keep my house tidy. It was very tidy before he moved in. He has multiple times left that specific battery charger sitting plugged in on the kitchen counter for almost a week, so, yes, I have moved it from the counter into the garage. I have to set it on the garage floor right by the door because the garage is so full of his tools and car parts and boxes containing car parts (that he spends all his money on even though he can‚Äôt afford while he owes me thousands) that you can‚Äôt walk into the garage. I just got a shed so that he can store all of that in there. He says he now owes me less $100 since I broke his charger, even though I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he was the last one to touch it. I sometimes ask him to move this or that, and he‚Äôll just stick it in the garage with all his other stuff. But apparently when I do that, I‚Äôm being disrespectful and breaking things. 

The cat piss comment is because I used to keep my cats litter boxes in my garage, and I had a cat door on the door from inside my house into the garage, but I‚Äôve since closed it up and moved  their boxes inside. The only time a cat gets in the garage now is when my boyfriend leaves the roll up door up when he‚Äôs outside working on a car, and the stray cat we feed gets in there.

The ‚Äúfine‚Äù he mentions I will get is because he‚Äôs had his car up on jacks and been working on replacing the clutch for a while. Our city has a rule that says you can‚Äôt have inoperable cars for longer than 2 weeks. We got a warning saying he has until Monday to fix it, but really all he has to do is take it off the stands and not make it look like it‚Äôs being worked on. So he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs not going to have his clutch done because I broke his charger and the city is going to fine us on Monday. Except he won‚Äôt pay the fine, and it‚Äôll be my responsibility because the house is actually in my name.

He says stuff like this to me very often. He blames me a lot. All the comments in my other post told me I need to leave him. I agree, and I think I need a solid plan before doing that. I‚Äôm scared, and he owes me thousands of dollars. I also would like to have a reason. I want to be able to tell our friends and his parents, who adore me and literally ask me when I‚Äôm going to have his baby, that their son is ___ and send screenshot proof before he can lie to them and blame it all on me.

I'm fucking terrified. And I feel so bad, and regret everything I did. The police got involved about four days ago and charged him with multiple accounts and ever since he has subtly breached no contact by expressing his love for me, how he misses me , and even sending money to my bank for food.

He has blamed it largely on his mental health (ADHD, PTSD, severe depression), and his impulse control/rage issues. I've had endless conversations asking him to please stop, begging him to please stop, encouraging him to do anger management, meditation, join some kind of group therapy, see a psychologist, do couples therapy, etc., for about \~4.5 years (ever since it first started).

We were both in a VERY bad mental place when we met. We soothed each others' wounds and traumas, and in many ways, helped and supported each other.

When he's good and sweet, he's really incredible, and I just want that to last. In the ""good"" times, I tend to forget how bad it can be, and accept his apologies. But after each fight, I tell him it's not ok, that I need him to stop, that I can't keep handling this. He sees me cry, break down, shut down, have headaches/pains for days, get stressed out, miss work/school deadlines, and yet it keeps happening. 

I told him 1.5 years ago after our engagement that he needed to stop this if we were to get married. We postponed marriage 6 months ago because he had more episodes, and I told him again that he had behaviors that he needed to change.  I have tried several times to explain to him that he's being abusive, and until very recently he's always denied that it's real abuse, saying it's not like he is beating me up or giving me a black eye, so therefore it's not that bad and I'm exaggerating. He's apologized for being a ""jerk"" or being an ""asshole"" and acknowledges that he has shitty behaviors, but has not acknowledged that it's abuse.

A few weeks ago, after his last episode sent me to a nervous breakdown, I told him I didn't know if I could continue our relationship. After that, he realized he might lose me and suddenly shifted gears. He enrolled in psychotherapy (he plans to go 1-2x/week), started meditating 2x daily, seems highly motivated to change, and was suddenly acknowledging that everything he'd done to me during his episodes throughout our had been abusive. We went through a list of all his episodes, and he acknowledged full-heartedly that it was indeed abuse, that he'd treated me terribly, that I deserved much better, and that he had followed the same cycle of abuse he learned from his parents (as I've been telling him to years, but he's been resistant to hearing). He did all of the things I'd asked him to do 4.5 years ago, and consistently throughout our relationship until now.

He is finally saying he wants to fully change his episodes/behaviors for HIM, for HIS life, and also for me. But why has he waited so long? Why has he waited until I'm about to leave to do everything I wanted him to do, everything I asked?

He‚Äôs always been a little neurotic about things like plans and giving him a heads up before I do anything. He generally doesn‚Äôt like it when I do things he hasn‚Äôt approved first, like when I order something at a restaurant or when I make plans with people he doesn‚Äôt know that well.

But that‚Äôs just how he is. I guess he‚Äôs a micromanager and can be a little uptight about things but I never took any of that as abusive.

The first time I mentioned that he's being emotionally abusive was about 1 year into our relationship. After he was screaming at me and calling me names for hours over a stupid reason (me putting a dish in the wrong place), I told him that he was emotionally abusing me. He denied it and flipped it back on me, calling me the emotional abuser. Everytime since then, whenever I mention that he is abusive to me, he has mocked me, laughed at it, said it's not ""real abuse"" because I'm not covered in bruises, and that I'm lucky to be with him because some men are *actually* abusive and hit their wives. His abusive episodes happen roughly once a month, and I have told him a handful of times that he's being abusive to me but he always acts like that's ridiculous.

Now that I am seriously on the verge of leaving him (we are on a break), I laid out ALL the emotionally/verbally abusive episodes to him, very clearly, and explained exactly why these are textbook examples of abuse. I sent him domestic abuse resources outlining the types/techniques of abuse he had used (yelling, calling me names, throwing things, pounding his fists, kicking things, punching the wall/table close to us, breaking stuff in front of me, threatening silent treatment, stonewalling, dumping me, waking me up in the middle of the night to yell at me, abandoning me in unfamiliar places, humiliating me/yelling at me in public, etc). I explained to him how law enforcement, domestic abuse experts, and mental health professionals all agreed that this abuse, and that he had done ALL of these things.

Finally, he agreed to everything. He had a sudden ""epiphany""/wakeup call where he suddenly realized that yes he had been abusing me, hurting me, and mistreating me for years, that he felt absolutely terrible, and that I deserved much better. He is fully ready to accept and acknowledge the abuse for the first time ever and says he wants to change by meditating and getting extensive psychotherapy (which he's resisted for years). He wants to completely eradicate the abusive behaviors and be a different person, and he wants me to give him another chance.

Is this common? Should I believe him? Why is it that they deny they've been abusive until you're about to leave? How does your abuser react when you tell him he's abusive?",2025-01-14 20:06:12,2025-03-17 03:20:06,abuse

My sister invited me to her birthday brunch/festivities on Sunday and I was able to attend at the last minute as my brother-in-law volunteered to watch my son since he was already with my nephews.

1flx9at,HELP - husband is emotionally abusive and I don‚Äôt know what to do  ,Visual_Most4357,130,106,https://v.redd.it/lv59pvxz24qd1,"Hello everyone, first time posting here. Please excuse any grammar errors, English is not my first language. 

My husband and I have been married for 2 years, and we have a 5 month old son. Although we had some issues while dating, things were overall good during the beginning of our relationship. But it started taking a dark turn towards the end of my pregnancy. 

Fast forward to now, this has become our routine. My husband systematically insults me and belittles me anytime we have a minor disagreement or I complain about anything at all. It feels like I‚Äôm constantly walking on eggshells and I can‚Äôt voice any opinion, otherwise he‚Äôll blow over. This also extends to our son, who gets insulted and yelled at for doing basic baby things like crying when he‚Äôs hungry or needing someone to rock him to sleep (even though I‚Äôm the one always tending to his needs, I never force husband to do it).

The recording I attach is today‚Äôs example of a fight that started with me getting mad at him and ‚Äúnagging‚Äù him for name calling our baby because he was crying. He was crying because he was hungry. During the whole recording, he was holding our son, who has to witness this toxic dynamic. Husband kept our son in his arms with me unable to take him since he was threatening to leave with him (not the first time, he has been using this threat since baby was 8 days old). There was also a friend of Husband‚Äôs who was also a witness to this but seems to think his friend‚Äôs actions are justifiable.

Needless to say, I don‚Äôt love my husband anymore and I‚Äôd be happy to never see him again. But I worry about our son. If I leave him, I worry that I‚Äôm escaping this man‚Äôs emotional abuse but leaving my son to suffer all of it instead. I won‚Äôt be there to try to shield him anymore, or to take it for him. On the other hand, this situation is severely affecting my mental state and my ability to focus and properly care for my son. I also wonder if there is a small chance that husband might not be as abusive if I‚Äôm not around to ‚Äútrigger him‚Äù. 

Another concern if we end up divorcing and writing a custody agreement is the fact that I will have to return to Europe as I can‚Äôt make ends meet here. That would mean sending my baby boy over to the USA with this man for extended periods of time.  

If anyone has any piece of advice, it would be incredibly appreciated. I‚Äôm at a loss. Thank you to those who read this.",2024-09-21 07:04:35,2025-03-17 03:21:19,abuse

1i2jjaa,Is it still abuse if they have a serious psychiatric or medical condition? ,anonykitcat,6,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1i2jjaa/is_it_still_abuse_if_they_have_a_serious/,"This is the thing I'm really confused about, and is probably what's kept me staying for so long in an abusive relationship, because I keep making excuses for him. He has multiple mental health conditions, and possible a neurological disorder as well. So I've been excusing/forgiving all the terrible ways he's treated me, thinking that he is not mentally/neurologiclaly well, but I still love him regardless (when he's nice, he's very sweet, but he has extreme rage and anger issues that can be cruel and terrifying).

So -- if they have a serious mental health condition, is it still abuse?  
What about a physical/neurological condition?

If they act violently if they have a personality disorder, autism, chronic pain/illness, schizophrenia, dementia, Huntington's disease, etc...is it still considered ""abuse"", or is it just violent/unsafe behavior?

At what point should you stay with the person no matter what (even if they sometimes scare or endanger you) out of love and loyalty, vs prioritizing yourself/your own safety by leaving them?

I told him no, he knew I said no, he said he was almost done and ""just open up it's fine""... I cried my eyes out and he apologized and promised to be better. But he continues to wake me up with sex while I am unconscious and exhausted, and definitely don't want to. I told his mom about it, looking for support, and she said ""He's 20. Guys are just like that."" 

A couple of weeks later, he and I were arguing and I called him abusive, and he said ""I don't know where you're getting all these ideas from but you just come up with this shit and all these prophecies, I haven't done shit."" I almost went berserk. This man.... he calls me an idiot, an entitled bitch, he tells me to shut up, to fuck off, to go rot, etc ALLL the time. And I am the only one doing chores and spending money on necessities. 
I keep asking for a break, or to be just co-parents and nothing else and he keeps saying no and that he'd find me if I left him. He said if I ever speak to any other guys that he'd break my phone and slash their tires...
I have literally begged for us to just break up and he refuses. I know it sounds like I could leave anyways but my only other housing option is across the country with my parents and I'd have to schedule a flight, get a ride to the airport, and pack suitcases etc; all WITH my two year old. And all without him intervening. Before our child was even born, my partner told me he wouldn't let me fly home, that he'd break my ID in half and make it unusable if I tried. 
I can't stand him most days... even when I start to like him, he'll suddenly slam a door or tell me to mind my own fucking business, and bam I hate him again. 
So I went out with someone else. And I really had a good time and liked them.. so we went out again.... and plan to again. 
I know it's unexcusable.. it's awful. I know I know. It just feels like a relief. Like a burden off my shoulders.

My ex lives fives hours away from me on a property with acreage so he takes my dog, G,  in the spring and summer so she can enjoy the outdoors and I have her fall and winter.

He called me Tuesday night and told me she was very sick vomiting and hadn't kept down food for water in three days.
I flip out begging him to take her to the vet. He says he can't afford it. I say I will pay!! Just please take her!! He tells me he doesn't trust me to pay and he can't risk me not paying. I finally get him to agree to take her as soon as the vet opens in the morning.

I get the first two screenshots of text messages at 12:30am Wed saying she passed.

Friday he called and said I'm going to be mad at him but that G is alive and healthy.
Turns out he can't take her where he's moving to so he had to fess up.

The last two screenshots from Facebook messenger where he ""apologizes‚Äù but says he did it because I broke his heart. We haven‚Äôt been together in over a year. 

We've arranged to meet for me to get her today (Sat).

Obviously I'm extremely relieved my baby girl is ok!!! This man has put me through so much hell but this tops it all.

Over the years he's caused loss of hearing in my left ear from my head being stomped on in his work boots, broken cheek, broken nose, bruised ribs, multiple concussions, countless black eyes, two broken teeth, bone spurs in my neck from trauma‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs just off the top of my head. Not counting material objects he's ruined of mine and cheated constantly.

He rarely cries but he bawled when we talked on the phone Wednesday 
morning over her ‚Äúloss‚Äù.

I really believed him. I've been in absolute misery. I had been sober for years but I got wasted Wed and Thursday to numb the pain and guilt I felt.
I'm stunned and frankly traumatized.

He'd say it a lot. And I had no reference... Bare in mind that I don't go around measuring people nor do most people announce their height... üòÇüòÖü´† So I didn't realise, the truth. 
Okay, there were signs... His friend who was noticeably taller once said they were 6ft. After they left my abuser said ""I don't know why he says he's 6ft, I'm nearly 6ft."" Okay... And when he allowed me to buy a six foot Christmas tree... I noticed it was much taller than him. Huh. I guess though, his height wasn't really my main concern... I was in survival mode, so I didn't see so much that was right there...

I have a partner who is 6ft. And he's a mountain compared. I'm assuming my abuser was 5ft 8 at most... üòÇ I don't know why that's so funny to me right now. ü§£

Luckily he‚Äôs an ex now, so I‚Äôm safe now. We broke up a little over four years ago. For me, the break up was surprisingly easy. There was some struggle and sadness of course, but more than anything, it was a relief. After the break up, I didn‚Äôt think about him for years, until recently. 

The abuse was emotional. He called me names, pointed out everything that he thought was wrong with my body, compared me to others, threatened me with violence and he took nude photos of me when I was sleeping and coerced me with those photos. Also cheated on me with multiple women. There were other things as well, but I don‚Äôt want to go into detail. At the time I knew what he did was wrong but I didn‚Äôt realize that it was in fact abuse.

I mentioned that I hadn‚Äôt thought about him since the break up and that is true but I have thought a lot about the things he said about me. He managed to make me believe that I‚Äôm disgusting, crazy and that there is just something really wrong with me and that no one would want to date me. I realize that it‚Äôs probably what he wanted and that it might not be true. But still, I can‚Äôt go on a date because I‚Äôm so scared that my date would actually see me the same way he did. 

So my confidence is not good but other than that, I‚Äôve been okay. Until recently when I heard how he‚Äôs doing. He has a new girlfriend, they even have a child together. He has a good job and he‚Äôs providing for his family. He has bought a house for them and is renovating it. I heard that they are really happy and that he has changed a lot. With me he was jobless and I had to pay everything and do all the household work. 

Hearing about him made me so angry and bitter. He gets to continue his life without any consequences. He would have never done any of that for me. I thought he just wasn‚Äôt a good guy. Turns out he actually can be. So he chose to abuse me. How is his new girlfriend so much better? Why does she deserve all the love? and why did he chose to abuse me? It feels like he must have hated me, or why would there be such a difference between how he treated me and her. It also makes me believe everything he said about me even more. 

I really don‚Äôt want to be such a negative person. It just feels like I have sunken into darkness. I‚Äôm sad and hopeless all the time and what‚Äôs even worse, I wish something bad happened to him.

And what sucks is that you might never get any type of closure regarding the abuse, or at least not the closure that you may want or need. 

It sucks that sometimes other people also think that your abuser didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, or mitigate their actions to make it seem like it was just a misunderstanding, just arguments, just differences between two people. It sucks that not everyone will be on your side, even when the evidence slaps them cold in the face.

It sucks that abusers get to live their life happily without repercussions of their actions, no consequences, and they don‚Äôt feel the pain they made you feel, and if they do it‚Äôs always to victimize themselves somehow.

I have closed in on a little apartment for myself. I got a puppy.

After being in a home where I was truly loved: my parents I realized how sad, cold and alone I had been. Over time I went blind for a lot of things.

Blind to a comfortable home temperature. Comfortable with thinking about every penny spend. Feeling guilty for buying that dress I wanted for so long that was finally on sale. Feeling entitled for wanting date nights‚Ä¶ being treated sometimes. 

I started to think about what makes me happy. I love to travel, dress up to go to a nice restaurant. Throw dinner parties, entertain people, think about Christmas gifts 6 months in advance. Have a cosy house‚Ä¶. And I realized just how much he had taken from me with that one little sentence: is that really necessary‚Ä¶

Is anything ever? If you have a roof, food, bed and a TV you are there right? Is travel necessary? Is having nice clothes necessary? Is a shower necessary? A haircut? A party? A hobby? A wedding? No! 

I know now that abusers are not per definition bad people. He is broken and he has trauma I have no time or energy for. He got free from abuse and decided to become the abuser. I know he is in therapy and we initially agreed on 6 months no to low contact. But I felt I was certain it was not for me anymore and I didn‚Äôt want to keep him dangling.

Breaking up with him was very hard. It made me very sad. I never wanted to hurt him and I loved this man very deeply. I wanted us to be each others happy ever after. We both came from dark places and I wanted us to thrive together. His family told me I was the one, I was everything he was looking for and I felt so lucky. 

But we only have 1 life and he has so much work to do before he even becomes the bear minimum of what I needed. 

I feel failed. Like my story has a bad ending. I feel very broken and sad. I will take my time to just be me. I hope he does the same. I truly hope he finds the one and becomes happy. Mostly I hope that for myself but for now I am enough by my self with the pupper!

18lp4c7,My husband abuses me but I need to know if I deserve it.,Ok_Soil_1003,117,152,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18lp4c7,"So this is just ONE incident. As for the Xbox thing, my husband made me have a sugar daddy and I did not want to do that. Come to find out that he's actually married so when his wife found out, I had to return the Xbox he ordered with his card or she was going to call the police and say we stole it. All of the pictures that have damage to our house is because I told him I had to return the Xbox. I then proceeded to spend my entire paycheck buying a new Xbox 2 days later. He always over reacts like this in every single situation. He puts his hands on me in every single argument. Just Friday he started am argument because his mom gave me $35 for a babysitter for our 2 yr old daughter. He beat me really badly that night, his friends who were coming over after they got off work said they could hear him yelling at me and calling me names and loud banging all the way down the street. They had to beat on the door. I'd also like to note that he will hold me hostage in a room and barricade it whenever he argues with me. When I finally got around him and was able to let them in they had to get him off of me and away from me. I was in so much pain from him beating me. This time he beat me and did the entire argument with my daughter right in the room. She was crying so badly it broke my fucking heart. She was crying for her mommy and saying ""Dada no no no stop no dada"" while crying over and over again while also crying for me. He pushed me one time so hard I fell back and that caused my daughter to also fall and hit her head. When I went to comfort her and hug her he pulled me away by my hair and slapped me and told me that it was my fault. He broke our closet door in our room that had a glass mirror on it which also broke right by my daughter. He then pulled the metal rod off the wall in the closet and beat me with that. I grabbed it from him and hit him in the face with it. For me that was my final straw and she is currently not living here but with my dad instead until I can find a way to get a place for her and I. I cannot have a job anymore because he won't watch our daughter. He will neglect her the entire time I'm at work. I will come home and she will have a really saggy gross diaper on, the same one I left her in, and stained clothes and food in her hair. She will have gotten into things she wasn't supposed to. I fought back for the first time Friday and he's now trying to play the victim because of one bruise while my body is covered in them. His other friend has had to pull him off of me before as well. He kept playing the victim to all of his friends but now that they've seen what he does to me and how he acts they don't really like him anymore. He blamed me for that and I got another beating the next day because his best friend and his gf saw what he was doing to me. I miss my baby so much and I go see her whenever I can. I'm so lost really. My dad won't take me in and I have no one else. He has isolated me from all my friends and family. I'm so confused because do I deserve this? Have I done something to deserve this? It's so hard to tell anymore. The things he says makes me feel like I do. This is genuinely only the tip of the iceberg. He has attempted to kill me 3 times. He choked me one day so bad yelling he was going to kill me that I was losing my vision. I had to kick him in the balls 3 times to get him off of me. The next time he threatened to shoot me with the gun we had (After this I sold it as it was in my name.) And held me at gunpoint. The last time was Friday when he took a piece of the broken glass and held it to my neck because I kept begging him to let me get to my baby and he told me to shut up and if I said it again he'd kill me. But I can't help but feel like I deserve it yk. I feel like I'm just a fuck up waste of space that should've never been born to begin with. Please someone help me because I genuinely cannot tell.

The autoban IS NOT in place for just *any* male-oriented subs; it's in place for subs specifically devoted to centering, condoning, and encouraging misogyny (r/DegradeThisCunt, r/MaleSuperiority, etc etc. Stuff like that).

**This is a genuine, warranted, necessary safety precaution tool** to cut down on a MASSIVE amount of misogyny floating through this sub.

**The autoban bot cannot determine context. For example, it cannot distinguish between someone using one of these misogynistic subs to endorse misogyny; someone using one of those subs to fight back against and challenge misogyny; and/or someone using one of these subs who genuinely did not realize its overall misogyny.**

**Therefore, we manually review all ban appeals related to this bot to see where they do and don't apply.**

If you receive an autoban as a result of this program and you are NOT using any of these sexist subs to degrade women or endorse misogyny, the ban will be lifted. If you are banned because you use any of these subs to endorse misogyny or you refuse to acknowledge their entire context of misogyny, this sub is not a space for you.

**As one example of the massive amount of misogyny in this sub, a post was made several months ago by a woman who cheated on her abusive husband who then beat her. Dozens upon dozens of comments from men said she deserved it and they hoped he beat her to a pulp or worse. Rape and death threats against women and women mods in this sub are a regular occurrence, as are gendered slurs, harassment, and sexual objectification of women. If you haven't seen the problem in this sub, EITHER YOU AREN'T PAYING ATTENTION OR WE GOT TO IT FIRST.**

With the election of Trump and Vance to the White House in the US, the world is about to see a massive increase in the normalization of and encouragement of *global misogyny,* including endorsement of violence against women. 

**This sub is for ALL GENDERS, but misogyny is a constant issue here, there has been a SIZEABLE uptick in misogynistic rhetoric since the presidential election outcome, and we are taking necessary precautions to keep it safe. Bear in mind the same people who infiltrate our sub with misogynistic rhetoric are also the same people who call male survivors ""p-ssies"" and tell them women can't be abusive and that they're weak (FALSE).**

He has to adhere tightly to his excuses and rationalizations, develop a disturbing ability to insulate himself from the pain he is causing, and learn to enjoy power and control over his female partners. It is unrealistic to expect such a complex structure, one that takes fifteen or twenty years to form, to vanish like steam.""

1i7m913,Is this abuse/grooming?( I was dating my 50yo therapist at 16),veronique4477,26,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1i7m913/is_this_abusegrooming_i_was_dating_my_50yo/,"Okay, firstly, I'm warning you, I might make a clown of myself and it will turn out that I'm just a pathetic narcissist, always trying to make myself a victim. Unfortunately I just can‚Äôt stop thinking (almost daily) about a weird relationship I was in during my early teens. Basically I was(like the title say) kind of dating my 50 yo therapist. I will have to start from a beginning since I don't think that it was, however weird, a typical abusive relationship, and also you might wander how does one even end up in this situation. Briefly, I was severly depressed from the age of 8, couldn't communicate my pain, so when I was 13 I ,,gave myself an eating disorder""(stopped eating to get emotional attention, not just academic preassure). My mother took me to several therapists, but by that time I actually internalised all the eating disorder thoughts and nothing worked, so she reached to some weird ,,nonconventional"" therapist/ex religious guru( I don't know how else to call it, he was one of the first people in Poland(where I live) to organise and lead group buddist meditations)/her ex lover( I know, quite an insane combo). I'll state right here my mother is also buddist, found this beliefs through him and basically sees him as a sort of savior. So despite him not being in fact an actual therapist, she thought he could in some way help me too. We met through Skype( me and therapist guy, he lived then in London) and immidietely clicked. It wasn't therapy. At first meeting he asked me if I starved myself because I wanted to be fuckable to men, and wouldn't accept my protest to that statement. Also immidietely declared that he wanted to be my friend and asked for my number. Me being 13 and not knowing how therapy works, thought it was normal. My mother knew about everything and even encouraged it. Soon after we would be basically inseparable, I would text him all the time, videocall a few times a week. Soon we started visiting him and his wife in London pretty regulary. Now, weird thing, despite our super intense contact I don't remeber much from that time despite him constanly wanting to talk with me about sex(asking if I think about it, what do I like, what porn I like etc), making comments on my body( how beautiful and enticing it was), getting mad at me for ,,not being able to start interesting conversations, and being very touchy feely with me(although NEVER crossing any serious boundries. Thats way I'm still constantly questioning the whole situation. It was more like constant hugs, embraces, brushing my hair, giggling me, tying my shoes, always playing with our feet under the table). When we were visiting them he would drink and also give me to drink copious amount of alcohol( I was, again, 13-14), trying to be my mentor also in drawing which I was persuing at that age, often being VERY rigorous, basically bringing me to tears. Food problems got better because I basically was in love with him and got a reason to live now. Also he would just tell me what to eat and how much. Everyone( my mother and his wife. I didnt have friends and quite a poor contact with rest of my family) knew about everything, thought it was perfectly normal and he was my savior. He also encouraged me (to be honest sometimes even forced) to completely cut off contact with my dad( he was also living in a different country anyway, but we had phone contact before), later with whole his side of family and start practising buddism for 2-4 hours a day. He also really preassured me to finish high school early so I could study in london(where he lived), getting REALLY mad at me for my struggles with school at that time. They were mostly due to depression, which was also the reason for him to call me lazy and unmature, and threaten to ,,not be interested in being my friend""  if I ,,keep living like that"". By the time I was 15 he had planned that we will go on  holidays to Italy toghether, even booked us a hotel room with one bed in advance, basically told me he wanted to sleep with me there. Again everyone knew, did nothing. Unfortunately, or fortunately at that time, I was also starting experimenting with drugs at that age, and ended up getting quite seriously hit by a car while high. Excatly around time of our planned holidays. So again, nothing really happened, but weird thinking back. On the other hand he, almost the next day, flew to visit me in the hospital and kissed me passionetly on the mouth for the first time. He was staying with me often then when I was back home but still immobile, showing me porn, encouraging me to masturbate and tell him about it, carrying me around( I had to lay in bed for months, i broke pelvic bones). When I was freshly 16 I basically was allowed to fly to him myself. That's the time our full-blown ,,romantic"" relationship started. He declared his love and desire for me, stated I'm the best thing that happened to him and he ,,wants to be with me"". We were then kissing all the time, holding hands, he was sometimes groping me, often going around me naked, encouraged me to be naked especially on skype calls also, feed me by hand, spit liquids into my mouth( dont even ask, I suppose that was his kink, I thought it was normal back then). We would drive around whole England( also to avoid raising suspicion in his wife ), sightseeing beutiful nature and art, eating fancy meals and drinking expensive wines, he would buy me gifts and give me money, to my 16 yo terribly lonely self it was paradise. And yet he didn't sleep with me, always said he's going to do that if I turn 18 and stay loyal to him. So I don't know what to feel about this, to be honest nothing really happened. But things started to get more painful.
 Besides the constant diminishing and demanding to ,,get to his level"" or he will loose interest in me, giving me alcohol constantly, making comments about my food and excersise routine so I'll have a perfect body, he started to get very possesive. He would never admit that though, said he wanted me to get some experience before our ,,big night"" even. Yet was extremely disapproving of every new person I met, always coercing me to break contact with them. I had only him, my every day, my every thought was consumed by him. And that's when he one day decided to tell me I was a stupid kid to even think we would ,,be toghether"". Told me to write in my notebook several times that I won't be acting and dressing so slutty around married men again, forced fo apologise to his wife, and treat this whole relationship as ,,fun experience"" and be his ,,mate"" now. The only problem was that my whole fucking word shattered, I fell into complete hysteria, experienced serious depersonalization and derealization and geniuly thought I would just die from sheer despair and broker heart. Never experienced anything like that again in my life and I had tons of mental health struggles. Yet I knew that I had no one to save me, so I stayed with him anyway. He would still engage in some romantic/sexual gestures, but shamed me when I shown the initiative. And from time to time, laughed and mocked me for treating it seriously all again. My mother and his wife saw me as some wicked temptress. During our ,,relationship"" I had gone from elementry schooll to high school, changed high schools, didn't make any friends anywhere because of his constant demands to call or text me on breaks, and generally feeling so out of touch with my peers since I was basically living like a adult with him. I was completely lonely and depressed, missing him all the time, now also rejected. During one of our super drunk conversations he asked to escape with him. He was deadly serious. I was to stunned and drunk to even think, so I said on autopilot said no, which led to more diminishing and witholding affection since I was a stupid teenager and,, not treating this seriously"". When I was 17, there was a situation where I was on a dance camp and we had no private space so I couldn't anwser his phones. Everyone would freak out if they heard a 17 yo talking to clearly very adult men calling her darling. When I came back he threw a complete fit, again screaming at me, calling be disloyal, unserious, manipulative and disrespectful. I was so numb inside at this time, I just hung up. Didn't speak to him for next few years, even after that, very briefly. I'm 20 now and this is way behind me, yet, like I said in the beginning, I'm thinking about him almost everyday, I don't feel traumatized, to be honest I don't feel much at all, but it all just seems so strange and I had to get it of my chest.",2025-01-22 21:17:36,2025-03-17 03:22:35,abuse

I broke things off with my ex last night because he shoved me twice and spat on my face (I did not once touch the man)

All of this happened because he got mad at me for not finishing him off during sex because he was struggling keeping it up, so I wanted to take a break and go check on a cat that I recently adopted.

He got SO mad at me and called me selfish, and went to the bathroom and started jerking himself off to porn.

I asked him to leave after that and he kept on degrading me and it turned to him shoving me twice and spitting on me.

This was my 7th attempt of leaving him and I'm hoping to god he stays away for good.

His mother told me he's never behaved like this with anyone else. Which basically sounds like she was taking his side and saying that his reaction was valid considering the stress that I have put him through which is bullshit.

I'm asking if it's possible for someone to turn abusive if two people who are not compatible with each other force the relationship to work due to let's say a trauma bond.

Would the shoving and spitting happened with some other woman if she was more right for him?

I'm asking because I'm starting to blame myself for his abuse...even though deep down I know it wasn't my fault

1h6ctqv,"Why does everyone says ""abuse always escalates""? How often does mental/verbal/emotional abuse become physical? And does this count as 'escalation'?",anonykitcat,29,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1h6ctqv/why_does_everyone_says_abuse_always_escalates_how/,"Nearly everyone says ""abuse always escalates"", and I have considered this statement to try and determine if it's true (both in general, and for my situation).

For context: I have been with my partner for \~4 years, and he has *never* laid a finger on me. He considers men who batter/beat up women to be lowly and disgusting and prides himself in the fact that he has never done it. He says stuff like ""what kind of men would lay a finger on a woman?"" and ""it's so pathetic to beat up your wife."" He also reminds me that (despite admitting, sometimes, that he behaves in a verbally abusive way to me) that he is really not that bad, and it could be much worse, and *at least* he's never *""really""* abused me or hit me. He's promised me that he never will do that.

But here are some things (and some timelines) that he has done:

* At first, he was the sweetest person ever...didn't yell at me, told me how fantastic I was, how I was the ""one for him"", that we were meant to be together, etc. Bought me flowers, was very attentive, and seemed like an ideal boyfriend and life partner.
* Roughly 2-3 months into our relationship was the first time he ever raised his voice at me. I was taken aback and considered leaving, but he profusely apologized, said he was in a really bad mood that day, and that it was wrong of him to take it out on me. Then he was extremely nice to me for awhile after.
* About a month after that, he raised his voice again. It was the same thing: he said it was wrong and he shouldn't have done it, and profusely apologized. Then he was extra nice to me for about a week.
* This repeats a lot until \~6 months in, when he really ""raged"" at me for the first time. By that, I mean he wasn't just raising his voice, he was yelling/screaming and seemed extremely mad. I don't remember what caused it, but it was something minor. It involved him name-calling me (including all the curse words I can think of) and a lot of hurtful things were said, and we almost broke up at that point, but again, there were profuse apologies, and he admitted that he had a problem with anger and impulse control, and needed to work on it.
* A little after that, he had another episode, and I tried to ""take a break"". As I was leaving, he put a knife to his throat and threatened to k\*ll himself in front of me if I left. It was extremely traumatic for me, and I didn't leave...I stayed and calmed him down. I thought about calling the police, but they are not responsive where I live and they wouldn't have come in time.
* Sometime after that, we got into a fight because I forgot to bring something we needed when we went on an errand. This led to him trying to dump me/abandon me in a foreign city where I did not have my passport, keys, or wallet (I left those where we were staying). I had to follow him (with him running away and trying to lose me in the crowd) just to be able to get back to my things. 
* Over the next year or two, his rage outbursts would be similar: yelling/screaming, name-calling, following me around yelling at me (even if I didn't want to fight), etc. About a year or two in, he started throwing things. He became really angry over something and smashed his phone. Then shortly after that, he kicked the trashcan, smashed the lid, smashed the broom, and maybe some other things (I don't remember)
* After that, he was on pretty good behavior for awhile (we were also long-distance). However, he did blow up at me, call me names, and threaten to break up with me when I told him I was scared to visit him in his home country due to an active war (I cancelled the trip, but the plane was cancelled anyways because there were literal MISSILES in the air around the same time/place that I was supposed to arrive). He told me I was being selfish, a coward, that I didn't love him, and that I was overreacting.
* Recently, he got angry with me over nothing (I left a couple dishes in the sink because I hadn't slept and was tired), and threw a knife in the sink. When I told him that was unacceptable, he got even more enraged, and started throwing random stuff in the house as hard as he could and they were bouncing off the walls (nothing of mine, mostly just his stuff). I told him I was scared and asked him to leave, and he said that I hadn't even seen him angry/scary yet, but threatened to get *really* angry and to ""tear the whole house apart"". He stayed in the room despite me asking him to leave and kept yelling at me until I calmed down.

So, he's never hit me or touched me. He's thrown things, but not my stuff. He engages in verbal/emotional abuse once every few weeks or months, and in between, he apologizes, admits he has problems, says he tries to do things to ""work on it"", claims he is trying *really* hard to keep his rage and impulses under control. I am wondering if what I described counts as escalation, even though it's been several years and he's still never hit me. How do you know if it escalates? Does it sometimes never get physical until many years later? ",2024-12-04 10:16:05,2025-03-17 03:22:44,abuse

I (30F) have been with my (30M) husband since I was 19. We‚Äôve basically grown up our whole adult lives together. I‚Äôve recently decided to leave, and facing it is making me face some things I‚Äôve been scared of. Maybe I just need to rant, but I‚Äôm also scared. 
  
He has never physically hurt me. He has driven recklessly with me while mad, kicked things in the house, but never me. He hasn‚Äôt sexually abused me, but he would cry and whine when I said no to sex so much that I would give in. I thought something was wrong with me for not wanting sex. I cried once having sex with him and never told him.
  
He would threaten to throw my cat out, because my cat was having bladder issues. He is always making nasty ‚Äújokes‚Äù to me that make me upset. If I make a mistake, he gets mad and makes me feel guilty. Once I forgot a bag of groceries at the store, he was also there and forgot, but he blamed me and shamed me for it. It made me cry, I didn‚Äôt know he wanted me to grab his bag. Or if I spill/break something he gets mad, things like that. 
  
He doesn‚Äôt do any house work or any shared duties and asks me for money all of the time. So I do 50/50 bills with him but also do all of the house work. This is what started my thoughts of divorce, after the 700th argument over the same thing, in which it‚Äôs always somehow my fault that he doesn‚Äôt clean. Or how I shouldn‚Äôt complain because he pays our health insurance. Or how I‚Äôm too sensitive or OCD. It‚Äôs just ridiculous. He has always pointed out how shitty my friends and family are, and we moved hundreds of miles away. I stopped trusting them. I live with him alone now, far. 
  
There‚Äôs a lot more. But just so many years of it, I‚Äôm done. I feel emotionally cold towards him. I‚Äôm making plans to leave. I have recently discovered that my friends and family ARE on my side and they‚Äôre helping me. But I can‚Äôt help but feel awful. He‚Äôs not going to make it on his own. He couldn‚Äôt tell his left shoe from right without me. And I‚Äôm leaving him far away, and he needs my money (though he loves to act like he doesn‚Äôt). I don‚Äôt necessarily worry he‚Äôll hurt me, but I do consider it. I don‚Äôt know. I just wanted to rant. I‚Äôve made my mind up, but the build up to talking to him is killing me and eating me away. I‚Äôm trying to get my ducks in a row and maybe let him down gently, asking for space, and then separation, and then divorce. But what I really want to do is run back home. It‚Äôs a lot. Thanks for listening.

He stole $480 from me and then another $200. Whenever I‚Äôd bring up paying me back he‚Äôd just yell at me, call me selfish/ stingy, and just generally make me feel awful.

Brain fog: this is a trauma response due to the inflammation your brain is experiencing due to the continuous flood of adrenaline and cortisol your brain is experiencing.

2.) Diminished cognitive functioning: this relates to the brain fog. You find yourself having a difficult time executing tasks that require more cognitive thinking. Tasks that are quick and easy are preferred. Difficulty even planning out your day, for example, or for me, a person who loves to cook, a diminished ability to creatively plan a menu, or cook dishes for myself. 

3.) Short term memory lapses and forgetfulness: Like driving to the store, then passing it, then not remembering why you went in the first place.

4.) Disrupted sleep schedule: sleeplessness, combined with the desire to stay up later. Something about those wee hours of the evening belonging to ""you,"" and the time for you to feel safe and think, or retreat. 

5.) Weight gain: Due to a change in eating patterns, constant cortisol production. I found myself not eating much during the day, but then I would ""eat my feelings"" at night. 

6.) Dissociating: Feeling like you are ""checking out"" when with your partner so as to not get emotional and ""rock the boat."" 

7.) Gut issues: Acid reflux, constipation, bloating, etc. Constipation due to the constant activation of fight / flight. Bloating, due to a dysregulated breathing cycle, or literally low-key hyperventilating, causing you to swallow air and bloat up. 

8.) Feeling invisible or like you don't know who you are. You can't even answer the question of what you want for dinner, and stuff like that. You forget about the things you like for the most part. Your partner has zero interest in them, anyways. 

9.) Recovery and disorientation: Needing ""recovery time"" after spending time with your partner, but having trouble coming back to your life and tasks, since those things are not a priority when you are around them. 

10.) Headaches

11.) Isolating self: Some abusers force you to isolate. Others, it's mostly implied or reinforced by them having literally zero interest in your life. Also has to do with shame. You know deep down that what's going on is wrong and are unable to focus on anything else outside of the relationship and managing it, or cycles of guilt, self blame, strategizing how to win back to the times they were nice. So you feel like you don't have anything to offer your friends, and are embarrassed to tell them what is going on anyways. 

12.) Physical pain with no central cause or locus. 

I know there are more. These are what I experienced. Within a few days of ending the relationship (which, of course, he dragged out for another week, pretended to want to make things right, then decided to blindside me and be the dumper) my gut problems disappeared, and only flare up when I have occasional intrusive thoughts about him.

Yesterday, I spent the entire day supporting my best friend after she survived a brutal domestic violence attack. She was on vacation in Puerto Vallarta with her boyfriend when he assaulted her‚Äî pushing her off the bed and then repeatedly slamming her head against the stone floor, biting off two of her fingernails (removing the nail beds), punching, and scratching her. She is severely marked. Hotel staff intervened after she screamed for help three times. She declined police intervention out of fear of his retaliation. She immediately flew back to the U.S., covered in bruises, with a swollen face and a black eye.

I called some national hotlines for advice and they said they couldn't give me any legal advice (which I thought was weird, but okay), but they could share some support groups. I perceived this as paltry.

I then called the San Francisco police to understand what legal steps she could take. The officer on the line told me that she could file a restraining order at the courthouse, which we will do tomorrow. But because it happened outside their jurisdiction (and out of the country), she was ""basically out of luck"" but could file a police report if she ***really*** wanted to, recommending that she should sleep on it. Then he started questioning her story‚Äîinsinuating that there are ""always two sides"" and that ""sometimes people make things up."" He even suggested that we don‚Äôt know *how* her fingernails were torn off, implying that she could have done it to herself.

I was appalled. If I, as a friend calling on her behalf, felt this discouraged, I can only imagine how a survivor in crisis would feel. This kind of dismissive, victim-blaming rhetoric is dangerous and keeps survivors from seeking help.

I want to file a formal complaint about this officer‚Äôs response. Does anyone have experience with this? Should I address it to the police commissioner, an oversight board, or another entity? Also, has anyone else encountered similar resistance when seeking help for domestic violence cases?",2025-02-10 21:32:21,2025-03-17 03:24:00,violence

There was no physical violence, but he was shouting/yelling at me, expressing anger by pounding his fists, throwing/slamming things around, keeping me awake for hours arguring in circles, and threatening to tear the whole apartment up. He had this out-of-control scary look in his eyes, and is just so rageful and volatile over extremely minor things.

This is not the first episode he's had (he's had emotional/verbal abuse episodes every 1-2 months on average), but for some reason, it's the one that's stressed me out the most. He's never harmed/hit me, but he's done a lot of verbal/emotional abuse and breaks things/throws stuff around when he's angry.

Is it domestic violence?,FriendlyGuess6696,14,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1fprz5f/is_this_emotional_abuse_is_it_domestic_violence/,"I've been married for 10 years. I am thinking seriously about leaving/divorcing. I have been told by a domestic violence hotline that what I am experiencing is domestic violence and emotional abuse. My psychologist has said that she doesn't believe it is - that DV hotlines 'see domestic violence everywhere'. 

As most of you probably know, there are resources out there specifically for people in abuse/DV situations - I do NOT want to be using these resources and taking the opportunity away from others if that's not really what my situation is. 

Here's my situation - sorry it's so long but I want you to have an accurate picture:

* He is critical. Used to be VERY critical (there was one time that in the span of about 2 hours he criticised 40+ things that I did). He's not... insulting. It's much more subtle. So never 'You're fat, you're ugly, you're stupid.' But things like 'Is there a REASON you parked so close to the wall?' or 'You left yesterday's ice pack in his lunch box, haha.' He often makes it sound like he's joking - but it's always something I did wrong. And wrong is any way he wouldn't personally do it. He has genuinely worked on this - I'd say the criticism has reduced by 80%. But it's still there, and it's still daily.
* Any mistake I make, no matter how minor, has to be called out. Again - almost always in a laughing manner. But he rarely just lets little things go. There always has to be blame attached. Our 7-year-old is picking this up and blaming others (or blaming himself and feeling terrible about it) when he makes a mistake. As you can imagine, this has already destroyed my self-esteem - I'm so afraid it's going to destroy our son's, too.
* He won't take feedback or be accountable - he will say 'I did X because you did Y first.' (Our 7-year-old is unfortunately picking this up too.) I was in the hospital recently and asked him nicely to keep his voice down - he was diagnosed with a little bit of hearing loss, and he was speaking loudly in a shared room with other very sick patients just a foot away. His response was 'You should just be grateful I came to visit you at all and stop complaining.' (This is after I visited him EVERY DAY for 6 weeks while he was hospitalised 45 minutes away from us last year.) When I ask him to turn down the music in the car because it's too loud, he says it's not too loud, my hearing is too sensitive, and he gets very annoyed. (Despite knowing he has hearing loss, and knowing kids' ears are sensitive and I'm concerned not just for my hearing but for our son's when he blasts music.)
* He is very easily frustrated with our additional-needs son. This is mostly just raising his voice. There was ONE incident where he physically twisted the skin on his arm to hurt him after he was really frustrated with him (no marks or bruising) - to his slight credit he immediately stopped, told me he needed me to step in, and felt REALLY bad about it and has never done anything like that again (and I don't think he will ever again). I did immediately tell one of our son's medical professionals about this to get him support and make sure it was reported properly. 
* When we remember things differently - it's always my memory that must be wrong. He will never even entertain the idea that he could be incorrect
* We've had 10 years of marriage therapy. There are two things myself and the marriage therapists have been trying to get him to do for the last 10 years: go find his own individual therapist to work on this stuff with (he did.. but only for about 6 months and she didn't work out and he never got another one... that was like 5 years ago), and get more sleep (he will go for 1-2 weeks where he does, but then goes back to old habits). He is chronically sleep-deprived because he stays up until all hours playing games or doing things on his laptop (he's very techy). The sleep deprivation makes him a LOT more critical and a LOT less patient with our son. 
* We divided up the housework responsibilities (we both work full time) - he never does his consistently, and then I have to pick up the slack so our son has a clean place to eat in the morning. 
* He never says thank you for the things I do, but always expects praise when he does even a single chore. 

If this is domestic violence and/or emotional abuse - does anyone have any resources I can point my psychologist to, to show that this type of behaviour is abuse and/or DV?",2024-09-26 09:16:46,2025-03-17 03:24:14,violence

1ivyqx9,"He was never really ""sorry"" for the physical violence",Long_Strawberry9266,10,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ivyqx9/he_was_never_really_sorry_for_the_physical/,"I was with him for 7 years before he hit me, after we bought a house together and things continued to escalate. I'm no saint and my insecurities and emotional immaturity contributed to many issues we had but he has been very manipulative, coercive and physically abusive in the last year. 

I've found this sub very helpful, but one thing that seems to be common is that when people's abusers first hit them, they seem to immediately realize what's happened, or at least try to apologise and make ammeds. They will say sorry and promise to change. They won't of course but the initial reaction is still one of recognising it was a bad thing and they should be sorry and express willingness to change. I know there's no one size fits all, but my guy was never really like that. 

He didn't say sorry. He didn't seem to feel bad at all. I think it made him feel really bad about himself, but not for me or for the harm he caused. He would hit me repeatedly, or sometimes just once and the responsibility to be sorry was always on me. A couple of times when he saw the consequences of his actions (a bruise) he would act guilty and say sorry, but if I didn't comfort him correctly he would get annoyed at me for making him feel bad. 

Whenever I tried to talk about it he told me I was abusive, that I was sexually and emotionally abusing him and that my words and actions were worse.

Eventually after a year, and about 5 months since it last happened (I moved out), I messaged him and he apologized and said I didn't deserve it and it was wrong. But he also implied that I wasn't innocent and that it's convenient that I don't remember my behavior that caused it.

Basically I think he thinks I deserved it, even though he would never say that outright. He is all about accountability and taking responsibility when it comes to my behavior, but with this I felt like I had to chase him to get him to even show remorse. One time he even said that he could 'get away with it' because he couldn't see my bruises as they were all under my clothes. He thought I was just fine because I wasn't complaining or visibly hurt, but I was hardly going to complain to him? 

I've talked about this in therapy and with a close friend and both have expressed major concerns about his initial response to his violence. I guess I just wanted to vent a bit here, and see if anyone else's abuser was like this. ",2025-02-23 01:36:22,2025-03-17 03:24:17,violence

She has always been a girl of excellent grades and recognition, but she's also socially awkward. She doesn't have a good relationship with her parents and, over time, has become more and more isolated. Her life is only about her husband and her job.

She got married a few months ago, and I can tell something is off. Her husband is a former deputy prosecutor in Mexico. When I first met him, he wasn't kind‚Äîonly short words came out of his mouth, and he had a very haughty way of sitting. You could notice he didn't care to meet me or any of my friend's friends.

I also know he is very classist and speaks very poorly about migrants in Mexico, such as Venezuelans. Also, he's really paranoid when my friend goes out, even just for a coffee. Last time, she and another female friend went out for a coffee and then went for a walk nearby, and the guy became angry because, in his words, my friend was risking his wife‚Äôs life.

On their wedding day, my friend met his relatives for the first time, which was weird because they had been dating for about three years at that moment.

The wedding had an awkward atmosphere. Like I mentioned before, my friend's relatives weren't there‚Äînot a single one of them. Only me and some more friends, maybe like 10 people, were from her side.

My boyfriend and my friends are the kind of men who are affectionate, but my friend's husband and his brother were rude, shouting slurs at them, like ""putos"" (a derogatory term for gay people). And my friend wasn't saying anything. The wedding was weird, to be honest. I didn't see the joy of happy faces anywhere from anyone.

I haven't seen her since that day, but I know they went to Europe to visit Christmas markets. And she sometimes visits the U.S. for work.

She's more isolated than before, and I think it's going to get worse over time because she doesn't reach out to me or any of our friends anymore. 

To me, it feels like she's not interested in my friendship anymore; she assumes that we will only reunite every year for our other friends' birthdays. I don't know‚Äîmaybe I'm wrong, but when something is off, most of the time, it's because something really is off.",2025-03-07 22:39:25,2025-03-17 03:24:23,violence

¬†[Domestic violence and infant abduction in South Korea : r/abusiverelationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1gocz0n/domestic_violence_and_infant_abduction_in_south/)

Sadly, since then Courtney's situation is still desperate and she is fighting to see her son.

Parental abduction and alienation can occur in any country, but it is especially bad in Korea due to a legal system that provides no protection against it. I grew tired of emailing and phoning journalists regarding her case and the issue of parental abduction in general only to receive no reply.¬† So, I set up a Substack and typed up the kind of essay I felt needed to be written on the subject.

Courtney‚Äôs case is far from unique, but it is certainly the most visible right now due to her willingness to speak up. It‚Äôs also extra horrifying for a couple of reasons:

One, the court is continuing to side with her ex despite the multiple evidence of abuse, including an event in which he nearly killed his son before he was even born.

Two, that police and social workers were actively involved in taking her baby and then denying their role in it.¬† A cautious journalist may feel the need to add ‚Äòallegedly‚Äô to that, but having thought on it and looked through the evidence, I have no problem stating in my own work that I fully believe it happened.

Sadly, the defamation laws in Korea mean that many other affected parents are afraid to speak up. There was a couple of other horrifying cases that I was originally hoping to include in the article anonymously, of mothers within Korea who have had their young children taken from them by violently abusive men. ¬†But as of today I hadn‚Äôt received a message as to whether it was OK to include their stories, so have omitted them for now.",2025-02-13 02:23:06,2025-03-17 03:24:29,violence

My ex/spouse (27, transmasc) and I got together when I was 17 and in my senior year of high school. They were my first relationship, and they are the only person l've ever had consensual sex with. After maybe 6-ish months of dating, I told my ex that l was repeatedly raped by a 24 y/o man up until about a month before we got together. My ex did not take it well, and they blamed me for what happened. They were convinced that I ""wanted it"" and that I cheated on them, even though the assaults happened before we our first date. After that, they started getting more violent towards me. They would rape me as a form of ""punishment"" when I upset them. I would also regularly wake up to them penetrating me or touching me sexually. At some point during our relationship, sexual assault became a pretty much a daily occurrence. I lived in a constant state of fear and deep hopelessness that led to severe suicidal ideation. Towards the end of our relationship, my ex acknowledged some of the violence they inflicted upon me, but ultimately, they could not stop crossing my boundaries sexually. As a result, we broke up this past spring, and I moved out a few months later.

It's now been 8 months since I was last sexually assaulted; this is probably the longest time I have gone without experiencing sexual assault since I was at least 12 years old. I am finally in a space where I can start to process the trauma and abuse l've endured, and I am fortunate to be able to do a lot of that in therapy. More recently, l've been thinking about healing from sexual trauma & exploring my sexuality. At some point, I would love to have sex with someone who is not also my rapist. That said, I'm really nervous about the thought of having sex with someone, and I want to be very intentional about who I am engaging with. I am also somewhere on the demisexual/gray ace spectrum, and I very rarely experience sexual attraction. I've tried exploring on my own through masturbation, but I often find myself feeling overwhelmed with flashbacks of sexual assault and/or I find myself thinking about my ex, which results in me feeling a lot of shame.

All that to say, I'm wondering what your experiences with solo and/or partnered sex have been like post-sexual trauma. What has helped you heal? Were there specific types of therapy you found useful? Are there resources or books you would recommend? I'm especially interested in hearing stories of other queer and trans survivors of sex assault and IPV, but I would love to hear from anyone!",2024-12-28 03:31:55,2025-03-17 03:24:30,violence

September 23, 2021

Nine-thirty found her pressed against dark hardwood, copper hair splayed around her shoulders, each breath shallow and measured against the thunder of his footsteps. Don't move don't breathe don‚Äôt exist - her body desperate to vanish into floor grain, become sawdust and shadow. His footsteps heavy, pacing now closer closer - please universe collapse please floor swallow whole - traitor lungs hitching sharp little mouse-breaths that scream prey prey prey into the predator dark.¬†

Kitchen to living room. Down the hall. Back again. His bulk stealing oxygen with each pass. Her hundred pounds pressed against wood floors that held years of similar terrors in their grain. His two-fifty claiming every inch until air turned solid with threat.¬†

""Worthless fucking cunt.""¬†

Words like stones, bouncing off walls while the dogs melted into basement shadows. The house held its breath, walls contracting with menace.¬† Time drowned in the metronome of his rage.

""Get out get out GET OUT""¬†

Closer now, steps heavier.¬†

""LEAVE! RUIN YOUR OWN LIFE!""

The familiar choreography unfolded‚Äîmeasured approach disguised as reasoning, false calm before the storm. Her shoulders curved inward as his shadow fell across her face. Her breathing quickened, short desperate gasps betraying the terror she tried to contain. Muscles seized tight against the certainty of what came next.

""What makes you leave all the other weeks?!""¬†

Each question brought him nearer, air displacement pushing against her skin. Her lungs burned faster now, throat closing as his bulk blocked out light. ""What are you waiting for?"" The derisive mockery carrying more menace than shouts.¬†

""AREN'T YOU SCARED?""

She pressed deeper into the ancient planks, mind straining toward somewhere far beyond his looming presence, beyond the weight of space collapsing around her lungs, beyond this infinite moment pregnant with violence. Phone clutched tight. Whispers catching between ragged breaths: ""It's nine-thirty and he's beaten my head in... and I'm laying on the floor in the foyer...and‚Ä¶I‚Äôm laying on the floor‚Ä¶ and he‚Äôs beaten my head into the floor. I‚Äôm done. I cannot fucking do this. This is insanity..""

Truth compressed into timestamped audio while terror stole air.

Survival begged stillness. Smallness. Submission never enough but instinct curling her tight anyway. Become nothing nothing nothing - if cells could dissolve into air molecules maybe he‚Äôd forget - just empty space just dead air please - stuttering breaths shattered the nothing she needed to be. His tread vibrating through floorboards into her bones. Rage and sweat closing in.

""You're not happy here?! LEAVE!!""¬†

His voice perturbed by her very existence.¬†

Malevolent.



""Get the FUCK out!""¬†

The words exploded against her skull,¬†

followed by a sharp crack as his palm¬†

connected with her head.

puncuated¬†

fueled fury

*SMACK SMACK SMACK*

reality fractures¬†

between strikes



""Why-are-you-still-here, CUNT?!‚Äù

""AREN‚ÄôT YOU AFRAID?""¬†

His palm smacked against her eye socket again.



""HUH?!""¬†

*IMPACT*¬†



""Get-out-get-out-get-out-GET-OUT-GO!!!!!‚Äù¬†

His fury orchestrating violence¬†

Palm conducting agony¬†

Each strike precise¬†

Each word timed¬†

to¬†

maximum impact



Until finally‚Äî

""I swear to fucking God, Sam‚Äî

**GET!!**

**OUT!!**""¬†

""OOOWWWWWWWW!!!"" She recoiled in pain and howled in tears, his final words delivered another smack into her face. Something inside her shattered. Sobs ripped from deep in her chest, primal wails that echoed off walls.¬†

‚ÄúGOD DAMMIT THERE IS SERIOUSLY. SOMETHING. FUCKING. WRONG WITH YOU! There. Is. something. SO FUCKING WRONG WITH YOU!‚Äù

Tears burned hot down her cheeks while her voice climbed higher, hysteria clawing up her throat. Her wailing¬†

""WHY??... WHY?? WHY IS IT‚Ä¶WONT YOU JUST TELL‚Ä¶""¬†

The questions dissolved into wordless keening while his hands found her again clamping over face, palm muffling screams, and her terror crystallized into rage.

""**YOU GET THE FUCK OFF OF ME!**""¬†

Her small body surged against his bulk, survival overriding terror.¬†

""YOU GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME! STOP IT STOP""¬†

But two hundred fifty pounds of hatred drove her down, hardwood slamming against knees and palms. Her elbows scraped across floor as she crawled, his footsteps thundering behind, around, over her hunched form.¬†

""GET AWAY!!!¬†

LEAVE!¬†

ME!¬†

ALONE!!""¬†

Each word tore raw from her throat: rage fuel

""I AM CRAWLING.¬† THROUGH.¬† OUR ENTIRE FRONT ROOM. WHILE YOU JUST STOMP..ME‚Ä¶""¬†

Her voice cracked on the truth of it - this war zone hidden behind these walls, this nightmare playing out on old wooden floors while neighbors slept unaware. His shadow fell across her again and again

'Are you going to LEAVE then?' His voice dropped to that velvet-wrapped menace she dreaded most. 'Are you going to leave then? CUNT?' Poison dripped from each syllable.¬†

Rage exploding now point-blank, control evaporated like gasoline catching spark‚Äì

'LEAVE!! LEAVE!!'¬†

'AND. YOU'LL. NEVER.¬†

HAVE. TO. WORRY. ABOUT. IT. AGAIN!'¬†

The words now barely escaped between his gasping breaths.

She tried to stand, but his hands found her from behind, massive fingers digging into flesh.¬†

'Why are you still fucking here? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?'

Fury blazed through her terror, unable to move in his grip, her voice turning razor-sharp with mockery: 'Yeah, you like that? You little fucking bitch!'¬†

The words threw his own tactics back at him, savage satisfaction flaring as she claimed his language for her weapon. His raw fury ripped through the air‚Äì soundwaves slamming her backward.

¬†'WHAT ARE YOU, BITCH?! WHAT ARE YOU?'

Something snapped inside her chest. 'You beat people's HEAD IN...BEAT MY EYE IN SOME MORE BITCH!!'

""BEAT MY FA‚ÄîOOOOWWWWW!"" The word fragmented into a primal scream that echoed off walls while tears choked her throat. Her voice cracked and broke, each sob punctuating her words:¬†

""GOD DAMN IT. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU??? SOMETHING IS SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH YOU! FUCKING BULLY!!! THIS IS ALL YOU ARE""¬†

‚ÄúUNDERSTAND THAT!!!‚Äù

His massive frame pressed closer, trapping her between wall and rage. She could taste her own fear but something else rose beneath it‚Äîfury at this entitled destruction of her body, her safety, her reality.¬†

""GET OUT OF MY FACE!! GET OUT OF MY FACE GET OUT OF MY.."" Her voice climbed higher, raw truth tearing from her throat‚Äì

dictating darkness

""YOU ARE BACKING ME INTO CORNERS YOU ARE A BULLY!!""

Her howls echoed off walls while tears choked her words. But still she named it, each brutal truth punctuated by pain: ""You think... you can just... BEAT PEOPLE‚Ä¶INTO SUBMISSION!""

His hand found her throat then, two hundred fifty pounds of focused hatred crushing her hundred-pound frame against unyielding surfaces. Kitchen counter. Windows. Corners. Each new prison forcing desperate garbled gasps and terrorized shock.

""Get THE FUCK away from me!"" Survival and rage tangled in her chest.¬†

""You're backing me into the counter screaming in my ears!""¬†

Even through tears, even through terror, she kept naming his violence. Each impact drew fresh cries but couldn't silence the steel in her spine:¬†

""This is what you are! THIS is ALL you fucking are!""

Open hands never formed fists. Clean bruises blooming beneath skin. This wasn't chaos, this was calibrated cruelty ‚Äì

violence refined to art.¬†

Her small frame writhing against futility while his voice shredded raw:

¬†""GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT!!!!!""

Phone clutched tight one moment. Documentation whispered into darkness. Then - survival detonating through muscle and bone. Neither silence nor screams saved her. Both paths led to the same destination.

Muscle memory now. The familiar dance of gathering essentials while rage saturated their home's corners. Bag handles cutting palms. His fury keeping time. How many nights had she tried to pack to this soundtrack? How many escapes ended at his bulk in doorways?

‚ÄúI don't need your help.‚Äù Her voice cracked against the words, throat raw from screaming. Inside lights cast harsh shadows while she fumbled for her things, each movement a choreography learned through countless nights like this one. 'What are you doi‚Äî'""

""HERE YA GO!!"" Launched with sadistic force, the bag connected with her face as space collapsed. Shockwaves. Stumbling. Backward. He advanced - loathing filling the shrinking distance. His mind collapsing into eight-year-old spite wielding grown man‚Äôs power

""OH MY GOD!!!!! There is SOMETHING SO WRONG WITH YOU!!! WHAT THE FUCKING- FU-FUCK ME..."" The syllable shattered in her throat ‚Äì truth tore out between desperate gasps before his palm found her face. Primal terror. Muffled panic leaks between fingers. Her hands wild - grabbing, scratching, shoving. Wrist caught mid-swing - twisted back.¬†

Can‚Äôt breathe can‚Äôt breathe. Primal instinct. Terror. Body thrashing. Bucking blind against his raw distortion‚Äì entitlement to her breath.

His grip breaks. Oxygen flooding back ignites truth in her primal desperation:¬†

""You're going to kill me, literally fuc‚Äî""

Pure delusion twisting survival into assault:

""Oh you want to headbutt people now?!""

How dare she fight to breathe while his coward hands claim that right. The twisted logic of his rage - as if her desperate gasp for air was assault. Survival itself was defiance.

""YEAH WHEN PEOPLE ARE ATTACKING YOU!!!!""

His warped brain spinning deeper into deranged distortion. His fury erupts at the audacity to breathe without consent. Captured again. Hand clamping savage over her mouth and nose. Raw fear, primal screams dying against crushing pressure. Muffled panic. Words die silent. His grip seals tighter. Twisted entitlement corrupted the fight for oxygen into deliberate rebellion deserving merciless retribution.

Vindictive child-mind spinning violent behind grown muscle, petulant rage claiming savage dominion. Perverse entitlement contorting survival itself as deliberate provocation. Unforgivable defiance. Her refusal to suffocate quietly was an assault against his authoritarian delusion. Her spine arched wild against the wall. Her body a desperate animal. Nerve endings ignited primal instinct, she twists and bucks. She breaks free. Bolting. Running.¬†

Raw infant wails, lungs fighting for scraps of air between terror‚Äôs static. Her body had forgotten how to be anything but small, anything but helpless - producing sounds no grown throat should hold - diving deeper into the primal brain stem where language dissolved into pure newborn panic. Like a baby abandoned in the darkness.¬†

Fabric rustled, feet stumbled, her body staggered toward the door.¬†

Escape.¬†

Reality blurred at the edges - mind drowning in terror while survival dragged her forward¬†

Seconds lasting years, hours compressed to microseconds, reality strobing like dying fluorescent bulbs

Each breath came¬†

shorter¬†

shorter¬†

shorter.



Then - crickets.¬†

The night air shocking skin alive, past flowerbeds hiding hell behind their blooms. The truck's tire caught her collapse - rough rubber salvation against her spine while the knees finally betrayed her.¬†

Silence pressed in, broken only by cricket song and her ragged breathing slowly steadying against the night air. Inside that house he stalked and raged, texts firing like bullets into the fragile bubble of escape she'd carved in this driveway. Her phone glowed accusation after accusation.¬†

""I don't even know what to do.""¬†

The whisper into her phone disappeared into darkness.¬†

""I don't understand what the fuck I am supposed to do‚Ä¶""

Each repetition smaller,¬†

smaller,

smaller,

more¬†

and¬†

more

lost.¬†

""There‚Äôs nothing to do but just sit here‚Ä¶.¬†

‚ÄúThere is‚Ä¶nothing...""



The night air chilled sweat against her skin while messages stacked higher. Each passing headlight made her shrink smaller against rubber and shadow, praying

no one would see,¬†

everyone would see.¬†

The tire's solid curve against her back offered more safety than their whole house had in years.

""I cannot.. fucking.. do this""¬†

Her voice‚Ä¶

""This is crazy""

barely carried past her lips.



‚ÄúThis is so fucked up‚Äì

‚ÄúWhat‚Äì what am I supposed to do?‚Äù

Cricket song swallowed the words. Then - a single owl call pierces night air, its hollow who-who-who echoing accusation across suburban dark. She pressed harder against solid rubber. Her flesh desperate to quantum tunnel through this cold concrete beneath her, through earth‚Äôs core, through reality itself. Her lungs struggled toward a steady rhythm, wondering how long before she'd have to abandon this temporary sanctuary and face whatever waited behind that front door.¬†

""If he does..."" Her whisper trailed into still darkness. The owl's question haunting empty air: who will help, who will see, who will stop this?¬†

Rubber and concrete sanctuary measured in heartbeats. Tire treads pressing patterns into her trembling spine while her mind raced dark corridors of what-ifs. Seven minutes? Ten? Thirty? Time dissolves between insect chorus and terror's countdown. Nature‚Äôs metronome keeps counting while her world implodes.

Her legs trembled standing - knees liquid with dread. Each footstep toward that door forced stale air through lungs that begged to run instead. The porch light throwing sinister shadows across innocent petunias. Her garden - silent witness to everything, revealing nothing.¬†

First breath fights gravity

Second breath battles terror

Third¬†

wages war

Fourth¬†

surrenders to fear

Fifth¬†

accepts fate

Sixth¬†

door opens‚Äî

Hinges betrayed her with a whisper.

His fury found her first -¬† his towering shadow eclipsing hallway light. Hours of rage had sandpapered his voice raw but hatred dripped fresh:¬†

""Get the fuck out of my fucking life. Get the fuck out and LEAVE!!! And stay out you worthless fucking cunt""¬†

His rage shoved her smaller form through labyrinths of false escape, each exit becoming a trap, until walls consumed final inches of retreat.

The laundry room caught her collapse. Knees hit tile while chemical-clean air filled lungs too tired to scream anymore. Gravity release these bones please let them float past atmosphere, past knowing, she prayed.¬†

His footsteps thundered past - closer, farther, closer again, marking time like a metronome of horror. But something shifted in the rhythm of his rage, paces growing slower, voice dropping from roar to growl to mutter to silence.

Exhaustion‚Äî

collapse.¬†

Sleep ambushed her there. Warmth leaked from dryer vents while tile stole heat from heavy limbs. Moonlight painting strange shadows through laundry room glass. Time dissolved between fabric softener sheets. One hour bled into two, consciousness floating somewhere far beyond the laundry basket pressed against her feet.

His voice found her in darkness.¬†

""Love? Love...Sweet babeh?¬†

Wake up, sweet love""¬†

Gentle now. Honeyed. Nearly a whisper.¬†

Confusion fogged her mind while reality crashed back in waves. Her body remembered before her mind could catch up. Time spiral backward dissolve forward scatter sideways anything but now. Her lungs seized. Each desperate gasp birthed another wave of primal sound until she was drowning in it, consciousness fracturing under the warped weight of now.

""My love, please come with me‚Äù he whispered.¬†

‚ÄúPlease, sweet babe.‚Äù

And something in her splintered. Those tender words twisted through her skull like barbed wire, each syllable carving new pathways of pain while her throat worked around sounds she didn't recognize as human. Each moment both infinite and instantaneous

Time stretched and warped‚Äì

she was five,¬†

fifteen,¬†

twenty-five,¬†

trapped¬†

in an endless loop¬†

of terror¬†

while her adult mind¬†

watched¬†

from somewhere¬†

far away.¬†

""Promise me,"" she begged between guttural gasps, ""promise me..""¬†¬†

‚ÄúI swear, sweet love, I swear‚Äù

His gentle tone gouged at places already bleeding,¬†

‚ÄúI promise you. I promise you. Please trust me, sweet baby.""¬†

Her words dissolved into pure primal sounds,

‚ÄúPromise me‚Ä¶‚Äù though she couldn't remember what she was begging for anymore.¬†¬†

Exhaustion dragged her under on puppet strings, her feet moving without permission. His massive frame guided her stumbling steps toward their bed, toward the ritual that followed violence like a twisted prayer. In bed, her body betrayed her last defenses curving into his warmth like a wound seeking salt. His heartbeat drummed against her ear, steady and sure while hers still fluttered with terror in her throat. His fingers traced gentle patterns on her back and she pressed closer, desperate for warmth, for comfort, for the familiar touch, any touch, even soaked in threat.¬†

Morning waited with its hollow promise of redemption while part of her floated somewhere near the ceiling, watching this broken girl vanish into the barbaric tenderness of his arms. Body nothing but raw nerve endings seeking relief yet screaming wrong wrong wrong while begging closer closer closer, betraying every survival instinct as she sought desperate refuge in her wreckage, his wreckage, dignity drowning in the twisted solace of his embrace.

1gocz0n,Domestic violence and infant abduction in South Korea,dinoboy106,13,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1gocz0n/domestic_violence_and_infant_abduction_in_south/,"Hi all.

I'm posting here to try and help a friend who is currently trapped in South Korea and is fighting to see her baby again after he was kidnapped by her abusive husband.

This will be a MUCH longer post than is normally shared here, but for anyone who can give me the time and read through to the end I'd be most grateful, as there are ways to help this woman.  Her story is already very public, hence using her real name.

Courtney Lynn is an American woman who was living in South Korea alongside her two young daughters. She began dating a Korean man who she had initially met in the USA. At first the relationship went well. He was charismatic, supportive and seemed to genuinely care for her and her daughters. However, soon after they married and Courtney became pregnant his character switched, and the verbal and physical abuse began.

Courtney approached her in-laws to alert them to what their son was doing and ask for help, but their response was to ask her what she had done to justify being hit. Both her husband and his parents initially tried to push her into getting an abortion.

When Courtney was 32 weeks pregnant, her husband stormed into the house and threw down divorce papers. As he became increasingly angry Courtney and her daughters fled to a bedroom and locked the door. Her husband tried to force the door down for twenty minutes, screaming he was going to kill her. When she thought he'd calmed down Courtney unlocked the door. Her husband barged it open, the door hitting her in the face. He then proceeded to slap her in front of her daughters, before soaking her with a shower hose and trying to forcibly undress her. She tried to get her two daughters to escape the apartment with her, but her husband blocked them from leaving, claiming mummy was ""just playing a game"".

In the end Courtney fled the apartment in just a bra and pants and ran crying to the nearest convenience store. It was here that she suddenly felt a deep pain in her womb. The store owner called an ambulance. She had gone into early contractions due to being beaten and had to be given medication to prevent herself from giving birth too early. During several days in hospital her husband refused to visit her or pay for anything, callously messaging that he wouldn't care or pay a cent for her or the baby.

When she returned to the apartment her husband coerced her into writing a message that she wouldn't press charges. It was just a few words on a piece of paper, certainly no official document, but he took a photo of it and sent it to the police. When Courtney tried to file a DV case against him a few months later the police said that the note meant that the 'case was closed'.

Once the baby was born, her husband showed no interest in helping to care for their son, and his abuse continued. He would call the police and ask if he could kick Courtney and her two daughters out without reason. When they said ‚Äúno‚Äù he would make up stories of how she had hit him. The police would come round and keep Courtney confined to one room while they listened to only her husband's story. As someone for whom Korean isn't her first language, the police were legally required to bring a translator to talk to Courtney, but they never did.

The police weren't any better when she had to visit the station, which she had to do several times to report violence against her. One rudely asked her to stop crying. Another asked her not to file a case as it was soon time for him to go home and he didn't want to deal with more paperwork.

Her husband would also claim that when Courtney left on the school run with the baby that she was 'leaving with the baby without his permission'. He would block, push and harass Courtney all while she was holding the baby when she tried to leave the apartment, to get a reaction when he filmed her.

Ominously, towards the end her husband started to say that soon he would 'have your baby' and he no longer had any use for her. Tragically on 1st May, it all came true. After another bout of violence, Courtney took her three-month-old son and two young daughters to the police station to ask them to find a place for them all in a woman‚Äôs shelter. A family violence worker offered to hold Courtney's baby while she filled in the paperwork. With no reason to suspect anything was amiss, she handed her baby over. Only then did she see that, for reasons that have still never been explained to her, the police had also called in her husband and his mother. The social worker then handed her baby over to her mother-in-law, who put her in a stroller. Courtney tried to reach her baby, but her husband stood in the way, moving to block her. She kept saying, ""she cannot leave with her"", finally getting on her knees and begging repeatedly in Korean for her mother-in-law not to take her baby. The police and social workers did nothing, claiming it was ""just for one night"". Her mother-in-law left in the elevator. When Courtney got home all the baby things were gone.

She messaged her husband in distress, who said that from now on the baby would be staying at his parent's house and she would have no access to him.

When she asked the police for help, they said there was nothing they could do. Parental kidnap is not considered a crime in Korea. So long as one of the parents had the baby, it was considered 'a family matter' that the police don't involve themselves in. By law, Courtney and her husband had 50/50 parental rights. In most countries this would be enforceable, with one parent not allowed to block the other. In Korea 50/50 parental rights means that the police have no involvement in any kind of dispute.

Courtney called at her in-laws apartment and begged to see her baby. They refused and called the police. Eight officers arrived and escorted her out the building for trespassing. She requested the police CCTV that should have captured the moment her baby was taken from her. They refused to release it, then lied and said that Courtney had handed over her baby to her MIL willingly. The family violence counsellors who had given away Courtney's baby discouraged her from getting a lawyer, advising her just to 'be a good wife and then your husband will return your baby. She spoke to the parents at her daughter's school, but no one wanted to get involved. Some even laughed behind her back. Even the US Embassy said they could not provide any help.

Taking the baby had only ever been a way for her husband to control and hurt Courtney. He offered to let her look after their son so long as she signed over sole custody to him. Even more creepily, he offered to give her custody of their son if she signed over custody of her two daughters who weren't even his.

Courtney and her two daughters continued living at the apartment, and she filed a protective order against her husband. Always playing the victim, he also took out a protective order against her, though that didn't stop him from turning up and repeatedly ringing the bell for an hour (she also has this on video), or turning up five minutes after she left the apartment to harass her for the door code. Courtney desperately tried messaging and phoning the police officer in charge of her protective order to get it extended, but he pretended not to have received her calls or messages, which resulted in her ex turning up to throw out Courtney and her two daughters onto the street.

Now in a new apartment alongside her daughters, Courtney finally decided to speak out. She deleted all the old videos from her Youtube Channel 'Courtney the enthusiast'.  She has a Tiktok of the same name.  I won't link in this post as it seems to get me automatically deleted.  Also check out the Youtube channel 'Dark Asia with Megan' and her video 'Korean husband abuses American wife, abducts her child in Korea'.

If you're wondering why Courtney doesn't include the name of her abuser, or any videos that would reveal his face, then the answer is the ridiculously strict libel laws in South Korea. In most countries, you can only sue successfully for libel if someone says something that is provably false. Not so in Korea, where you can be sued even for sharing truthful statements or videos, so long as it's seen as 'damaging someone's reputation'. And as it's near impossible to out an abuser without damaging their reputation, the result is that defamation laws are often used to silence victims. Because of this, Courtney has to be careful not to reveal the identity of her ex. Despite not showing any revealing details, he has still attempted to sue her for defamation, so far unsuccessfully. Not only was she harassed by her ex's lawyer, but the police also phoned to rudely threaten her to take her videos down.

Finally in September she got a court date to file for temporary custody. By this time, as well as having several proven cases of domestic violence against him, her ex was under investigation for child abuse due to his behavior towards Courtney‚Äôs daughters, including lifting one from her feet in a chokehold. The judge said that if he were found guilty then temporary custody would change to Courtney. However, for now the court awarded temporary custody to her abusive ex as 'the baby is living with him for now and shouldn't be removed from the home that he is used to'.

It was also clear that no one in her ex‚Äôs family was interested in caring for the baby, because according to court documents they had already arranged to put him into daycare come the start of the new year, before he even hit his first birthday.

Courtney was supposed to be given parental visitation rights of two visits per month, but her ex did everything to delay and deny them. He refused to even send her pictures of her son.

Finally, last week Courtney was able to see her son for the first time in six months. It was a relief to finally see him, but she is restricted to one-hour visits twice a month with both a social worker and her abusive ex also present. Social workers condescendingly asked her if looking after the baby would be too much for her, even though she had been his sole carer for the first three months. She was treated as though she was a woman who walked out on her son after three months and must now be cautiously reintroduced to him, not as a mother who has her baby ripped from her and has done everything over the past six months to see him again.

The very latest news is that late last week Courtney heard that her ex had been found guilty of the child abuse charges she had filed five months before. So supposedly her son should be handed over to her for temporary custody, though when and how this will happen remains to be seen. For now, her son is still under ‚Äòthe care‚Äô of a man who‚Äôs now been found guilty of child abuse.

Since speaking out Courtney has been contacted by a dozen other foreigners in South Korea who have either had their babies taken from them or are staying in abusive marriages because they are told by their spouses and in-laws that they will never see their children again if they speak up or leave.

Things need to change: First, parental abduction in Korea needs to be recognized as a crime. It should be no longer possible for babies to be ripped from mothers and for the police to do nothing for months. As Jay Sung, another parent who suffered from his child being abducted into South Korea, puts it ‚ÄúIt is a systemic problem of the Korean legal structure that doesn't prevent parental abduction. It actually encourages it by rewarding the abductor with a de facto custody. Making the Left-Behind-Parent helpless with no means of recovering the child, even with court orders.‚Äù

Secondly, truth should be a good defense against libel. Abuse victims in Korea should not be criminalized for revealing their abusers.

I hope that Courtney will be a landmark case that shines the light on what has been allowed to go on for too long within South Korea. If this was just about one mother and her baby, it would still be worth everyone‚Äôs effort to reunite them. But it‚Äôs not just for her. We need to make sure that not only is she reunited with her baby, but that this doesn‚Äôt happen to any parent again. 

Please share Courtney‚Äôs story. Send her words of support on her Youtube or Tiktok channels. If you look on her Youtube profile you will find other ways to help her.  If you have any journalistic contacts, please see if they can report on her case.

Thank you anyone who read this far, and thanks in advance for any help you can give.",2024-11-10 22:35:17,2025-03-17 03:24:32,violence
1hxmj8u,Tw: Physical violence and evidence ,relibra,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hxmj8u/tw_physical_violence_and_evidence/,"So when I have been attacked my abuser is very very careful. 

I have had toes broken, strangled multiple times, face aggression is only ever slaps with no closed fist, he has grabs my hair and repeatedly bash my head against a wall till I get a big lump on it. 

I‚Äôve had some bruises from body slams on the floor etc but always sporadic on my body. 

The most violence is probably the head bashes but my hair is SO THICK that NO photograph captures the damage and I don‚Äôt want to cut it off. 

He‚Äôll throw me out of a car into road and my knees/hands will be bruised or scraped but just looks like a regular fall.  

I almost feel frustrated. I would rather he had just hurt me in an obvious way so I had the clear pics and evidence. He always did it where it was ambiguous and bruises ‚Äúcould be‚Äù just other things. Physical marks were always sporadic 

PS - I am currently are no contact with him and seperated for a while. I am still dealing with trauma and I just was thinking about evidence and the justice system and this came into my head. ",2025-01-09 20:35:01,2025-03-17 03:24:34,violence

Wanting answers to all this disrespectful and denigrating behavior I accepted. We met and he admitted to being wrong about me, admitting to having imagined everything that pushed him to behave so badly (he accused me of cheating on him, of wishing him harm, of making him watch without the slightest explanation, and committed to repairing his mistakes. Once he left, true to himself, he did nothing, leaving me once again without news on Christmas Day, a day that he knows was difficult for me. I meet him the next day, he stops , says hello, asks me if I'm okay, as if nothing had happened... I tell him I lost my godfather, but despite the fact that he experienced the same thing a few years earlier, no reactions. He leaves. sent me a photo of the place where our story began, then nothing... I asked him the real reason for his coming since he had not kept any of his commitments, to which he replied that I had to be lenient and patient!! Which I have largely been for months and months, because being the victim, he was cheeky to ask me that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶no more answers‚Ä¶..until the day before December 31st when he sent me a message that I only read on the evening of the 31st where he asked me what I was doing for New Year's Eve to which I replied my first New Year's Eve without him doubly bereaved because the day after the loss of my godfather I also lost a dear friend‚Ä¶ he replied ‚ÄúI asked you what you were doing on the 31st!!¬†¬ª I told him that I didn't have the heart to party and even less to feel rejected.... He didn't answer me anymore... However, he seemed sincere when he contacted me, now I just have the feeling that everything was calculated with the sole aim of hurting me during this time of the year that I hardly appreciate.... Is this the case or am I the one who interprets it like that?!",2025-01-03 09:39:02,2025-03-17 03:24:35,violence

He has never yelled at me or gotten angry with me. I have seen him get angry at other people and physical with them but never me. But I have always wondered if it would ever happen to me?

He moved out of my area and it seems into an area that doesn't take his shit as much. When police were called regarding my situation the neighbor said I was going to be killed which was accurate. He told me to be quiet while they were knocking and that I couldn't leave. They just knocked and walked away. I would think though they had probable cause to enter the apartment if my life was in danger but nope; they just left me in there. Anyways, he's been being arrested in Florida for domestic violence, assault etc...it seems they too have been letting him pay fines (he has money) and then be released. The latest charges though have to do with robbery, false imprisonment, assault, domestic violence. This pos has occasionally harassed me online and possibly has been reaching out to people I know. I'm wondering why these types keep getting released if they pay fines instead of serving jail time? It's a joke. It's like the system is set up for rich or wealthy people to buy their way out of punishment. If he was poor, I doubt he would be free right now. I'm just disgusted by the way I'm seeing this pattern and not just with him. Anyone else relate to this? Thanks. ",2024-12-25 17:25:02,2025-03-17 03:24:37,violence

1fustbo,"so I'm trying to help my parent with domestic abuse, but not violence",MaydayBaybay03,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1fustbo/so_im_trying_to_help_my_parent_with_domestic/,"so my(20) parents are two women living in Indiana, I live with them, one of which we'll call Parent1, the other we'll call Parent2.

I grew up in this house so I know what (Parent2)she's like, she'll throw fits over the smallest of things, and come about as close as she can without actually touching you, she'll break things, punch walls, throw objects in your direction without actually aiming at you, and scream for hours or even days, depending on how much of a fight you put up, this is all from my own experience growing up with her. on occasion even threatening to kill herself if she doesn't get her way, which peaked a few months ago when she, during an episode, smashed a beer bottle down on her seat, while it was in her own hand, then proceeded to bleed profusely throughout the house, slamming doors, hitting walls, screaming about everything, before locking herself up in the bathroom for the night, not to be seen until the following morning having bandaged her hand sometime in between, leaving me and parent1 to clean up the mess she'd made through the house which took several hours due to the carpet.

parent1 is a disabled woman who can operate around the house, but not much else, is she doesn't spend enough time with parent2, there's an argument, if she doesn't take the time to clean while parent2 is asleep, there's an argument, if she she wakes parent2 up whilst cleaning, argument. doesn't have parent2's coffee ready in the morning(parent2 is the only one who drinks it), there's an argument.

there's 2 main reasons the two aren't separated,

\* 1 being that if parent1 files for divorce, parent2 will garnish her disability wages, as parent2 hasn't worked for almost half a decade, making her dependent on that disability wage.

\* 2 being that they adopted a (now)4 year old, and for obvious reasons the child shouldn't grow up like I did around her, but in a divorce parent1 is afraid parent2 will take the kid, which she has threatened several times.

I'm trying to find an argument that will lead to convincing parent1 to leave her on the grounds of abuse which should alleviate both worries of hers, but all I'm finding on Indiana law is the¬†[definition of domestic violence](https://law.justia.com/codes/indiana/2022/title-31/article-9/chapter-2/section-31-9-2-42/), or¬†[definitions of abuse](https://www.in.gov/health/files/abuse_and_neglect_state_defn.pdf)¬†*as it pertains to care facility staff*¬†abusing patients. I was hoping I could get this figured out, because as it stands parent1 has told me her plan is to wait until parent2 actually physically hurts someone, as that appears to be the only merit Indiana law covers under spousal abuse?

I don't know, my head is spinning and parent2 is getting worse, this is the only place I could think to ask.",2024-10-02 22:25:06,2025-03-17 03:24:46,violence
1ggjv5y,My Experience With Gaslighting as a Male Survivor of Domestic Violence,Throwaway-625,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ggjv5y/my_experience_with_gaslighting_as_a_male_survivor/,"If you are a man reading this who is in an abusive relationship please don't be discouraged. Reach out for help. Most reputable, legitimate organizations like the domestic violence hotline believe male victims and take the issue seriously. There is a lot of talk online about how it's so hard for men to find professionals that believe them but it's not really true. Actual professionals know that domestic violence against men exists and they will believe you. At least that was my experience, one of my only regrets is not reaching out sooner. You are not alone.

Sorry for the long post. I'm just writing this to put my feelings to words. It helps me feel sane. If anyone finds any benefit from reading this then that's just the cherry on top.

I was in an abusive relationship about 2 years ago. I was so effectively gaslight by my abuser that not only did I feel crazy, but I felt like a jerk for feeling scared. They would blow up in a violent rage and afterwards when they were calm they would easily be brought back into the violent rage if I tried talking about what just happened, so I would wait for an other day to try to talk about it. Talking about it would often anger them and they would say, ""I'm setting a boundary that we can't talk about this right now because it's too upsetting to me and it's going to send me spiraling, we can talk about this some other time."" I would wait weeks and eventually months to bring up instances of escalating abuse. Eventually they would say that it didn't happen the way I'm describing, I'm making her sound like a monster, and eventually they would say that it didn't happen (all while the abuse is escalating.) Eventually, me bringing up any issue would often result in her getting tremendously angry at me. Most of the worst instances of abuse happened after I tried to talk to her about what was going on.

Once I exited this relationship I immediately started feeling more sane. I was able to piece together what happened and begin to trust my reality. During this time I had to avoid a lot of places and people that I used to spend time with because my abuser was there and I was actively evading her. Months after safely exiting the relationship and when we were no longer living together I tried reaching back out to people and it turns out I was ghosted and essentially excommunicated from most of the people I used to spend time with. To this day I don't really know what was said about me and why people won't talk to me and I probably never will. I am quite alone now. Back when I was seeking help exiting the relationship there were crisis centers hours from me that would take me but I the local shelter wouldn't take me (which was a big deal because I was a student without reliable transportation) because it was full, or maybe because I was a man, I'll never really know. I tried joining a domestic violence support group but they keep pushing back the start date because of logistical hurtles, or maybe it's because they can't accommodate men, I really don't know, it's been almost a year now. I truly believe that it's not because I'm a man but there is a tiny ember burning the back of my mind that thinks it might be. It all makes me feel crazy.

This past year I've been finding it really helpful to write about things that happened to me in my abusive relationship. Writing everything out helps me feel sane. There's a reason why my abuser didn't allow me to talk to anyone about what was going on, because saying out loud what's going on makes it feel real. Posting on reddit, reading what other people have gone through, and communicating with other people digitally has been indispensable for me. It sounds silly but reddit has really helped me and I am grateful to the people I have been able to communicate with on here. However, It can be being a man in what's predominantly a woman's space.

Domestic violence against men is weirdly politicized. Conservative misogynists use hypothetical domestic violence against men to advance their politics and it sows doubt that domestic violence against men exists at all. A redditor recommended to me a podcast called ""Why She Stayed"" which I have really enjoyed, I relate a lot to the woman who puts on that podcast. However, the podcast is centered around female victims and often speaks to the listener assuming the listener is a woman and it makes me feel alienated sometimes. So I looked for podcasts that talk about male survivors. When I searched for ""male victim of domestic violence"" on apple podcasts after I weeded through all the Heard vs Depp crap what I saw was a podcast called ""The Men Need To Be Heard Podcast"". It's a podcast put on by a ""male victim"" of domestic violence and I was eager to listen to it, but after listening to it I think it's a bullshit podcast. The way he talks about DV is not so relatable, the way he talks about reactive abuse, the way he talks about his ex-wife calling him the abuser, and also he says the most abusive thing his ex-wife ever did was suddenly running away with the kids, it all makes me feel more suspicion than comradery. Also most of his content is about conservative politics and custody battles. But then again my abuser has probably said some pretty heinous things about me to make people ghost me the way they did, maybe I'm just being a giant asshole for not believing the guy. The fact that so many abusers claim to be victims themselves and deny any abuse they did is so corrosive to reality that it fills me with despair. Once again I feel crazy.

It's really hard to find first hand accounts from male survivors of DV, but it's relatively easy to find online therapists or news anchors talking about it. It's often spoken about as a super rare occurrence that's a minuscule issue compared to ""normal"" DV. And the accounts of domestic violence against men that are reported on are some of the most horrifying, medieval, psychotic stories I've ever heard. My abuser did a lot of fucked up things to me but they never tied me down, sprayed bleach in my eyes, and cut off my toes. I 110% percent believe those men and they have the scars to prove it but it's hard for me to fully relate to stories like that.

Then I look for statistics online to see how common DV against men is and some say it's 1 out of 3 men, some say it's 1 out of 5 men, some say 1 out of 11 men face DV in their lives and nothing adds up. If it's actually common then why are there so few men who speak up compared to the amount of women speaking up. And when men do speak up it's often embraced by conservative misogynists to further their politics, while simultaneously being dismissed. I have experienced this first hand. It's so bad sometimes when I make a post or write a comment where it's clear that I'm a male survivor of domestic violence the comment is immediately locked, or my post is immediately deleted. I don't really know why it's deleted, but not knowing actually makes it worse. I could easily go on some MRA sub and post about my experience and a bunch of people would engage but they are mostly shitty and fake, there's a difference between people engaging with you and people seeing you. I want to feel seen. I feel so crazy that I feel a creeping self doubt and I have a need to stand up and say exactly what happened to me, because I know exactly what my abuser did to me even if it doesn't make sense to the rest of the world. I exist and what happened to me was real, even if nobody else ever knows, even if nobody would believe me if they knew.",2024-10-31 17:20:59,2025-03-17 03:24:47,violence

In light of this, how much do you disclose about past relationships where DV was a factor? And is there a way you specifically explain it? The level of abuse my ex did to me is so nuts that I honestly feel like I sound like I'm the one who is crazy just trying to explain it.

These have been the worst years of my life so far. I genuinely thought the only way I could escape would be to end my life. I just couldn't bring myself to leave him. He was my biggest source of pain but my only comfort after he hurt me. 

Now it's been a week since I broke up again for the nth time. He had me pinned against a wall, strangling me and blaming me for provoking him. He slapped me, dragged me by my wrist as I tried to escape through the front door. When I realised I felt completely numb and was just patiently waiting for him to stop strangling me, something clicked in my head. I had enough and told him to leave once he calmed down. I blocked him on everything as soon as he left my place. A few hours later I get a friend request from an old classmate I had a bit of a crush on. When he messaged me, I was elated. It hadn't been 24 hours since I left my ex that I was texting the day away with another guy. 

We went on a date 2 days ago and I had an amazing time. He was sweet and attentive and treated me amazingly throughout the evening. I'm very suspicious of his intentions unfortunately due to my trust in men having been completely destroyed. Due to this, I'm very hesitant and overly observant/paranoid. He texts me throughout the day and I can't help thinking he's manipulating me and hiding his abusive side. Anyway, that's another story.

I'm unsure how to feel about this whole situation. I wish I was strong enough to leave on my own. I'm disappointed in myself that it took another man to ""save me"". I could never do it myself.

1ehv3m6,I was so focused on his physical violence that I (F27) didn't notice the sexual abuse until 10 years later,Few-Chapter1719,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ehv3m6/i_was_so_focused_on_his_physical_violence_that_i/,"He was my best friend since we were 12. 
We started dating when I was 17, he was 18.
He was fun and kind, the ""shy geek"" type. Always supportive to me. It just made sense. I fell in love, and got stuck in a nightmare. 

I had to move for my studies, so we engaged in a long-distance relationship and saw each other whenever we could, each month or so. 


We were in a relationship for 3 years, we broke up because of his physical violence (at its peek, he strangled me and threatened to kill me, I had to escape).

I didn't know about any type of violence other than ""physical"" really. Only now do I see sexual abuse in his acts. I felt deeply ashamed for a very, very long time. I still feel a bit ashamed tbh. And so dumb. I hope that I can either help or distract someone by listing my stupid mistakes. 


Something always felt wrong whenever he talked about sex. He had this creepy tone which made me very uncomfortable. 

He tried to convince me that each and every person around me who was nice to me was secretly wanting sex from me. 

EACH and EVERY one. 
Man or woman. 
Could be a classmate, a teacher, a bus driver a cashier, a random guy in the street, a friend, a family member (?!), anyone. 

It I told him about my day, like about that nice lady whose always so cheerful at the bakery, he'd rewrite the story, telling she was so horny for me she couldn't hide it. And so on.

He wasn't jealous : he was hyped.
I often told him no, it wasn't like that. He wasn't even there ! 
He told me I was too naive, that the person definitely wanted to fuck. Started to describe gross pictures, to ask gross questions, to ask for details. I said I didn't want to answer. 

He tried to convince me that I definitely wanted sex with these people too. Tried to convince me that I was bisexual, while I was pretty sure I was straight. (still am pretty sure, but it confused me) 

He told me constantly that I was sooo lucky to have a boyfriend like him, whose okay with me having sex with other people. 

I told him I only loved him, and wouldn't want to have sex with anyone else. The idea of having sex with someone I don't love has always been disgusting to me. I'm very monogamous.

Day after day, he insisted. I was always sleep-deprived, because he was using constant emotional blackmail and I fell for it. Always breaking my boundaries, always wanting more from me. More time with him on the phone at night. ""Just a few more minutes"" until 1 or 2am (or later). I wasn't doing so well in my studies with so little sleep.

He had this twisted version of the world in mind. Asking multiple times if I masturbate at work, at school during class, in the train. Always told him that of course no I don't ?! 
So he begged me to try. I refused each time. He got angry, and mean. One time I wanted peace from him, so I just lied and told him I did it. I thought it would suffice to feed the beast inside him. Instead he asked many gross specific stuff. I was uncomfortable about this, I felt dirty, and decided I wouldn't lie to him again as I hate lying

He begged for nudes constantly too, for phone sex, and I hated that. Whenever I refused, he became very mean and hurtful, or hung up the phone. Used my weaknesses against me. Said that I didn't love him. That nudes were absolutely mandatory as we were in a long-distance relationship most of the time. Sometimes he even threatened to cheat on me. (Well, turns out he did cheated once) 

When I did send nudes, it wasn't enough. It was even worse, because he begged from more. A specific angle or a specific body part. Request like the use of toys on the pics even. Zooms. I told him I really didn't want to, and wasn't into that. I found that disgusting. 

Told him I was so very tired (which was also true, it was always so late at night). That I needed to sleep. That I really didn't want to take pictures, or to turn some lights on. 

His reaction was always first trying to be bubbly, and gentle and kind and supportive and smiling when asking for nudes/phone sex... And becoming very mean and threatening when I refused. He had two opposite faces, and the switch was fast. 


The worse part of the sexual abuse for me was that after months of sleep deprivation, he somehow managed to convince me to try sleeping with someone else. 

I told him repeatedly that I didn't want to. He told me each day that he would be so proud of me. That he loved me, and knew I could do it. That I was so lucky to get to try sex with someone else. He told me that we would spend our whole life together, that he wanted me to try with at least one other person to not be disappointed when I'm older. 

He asked me to sleep with one of my friends. So I did. And it was a terrible experience, because technically it wasn't rape, but I didn't wanted this. I felt ashamed for years afterward. 

And my abusive boyfriend was happy... For a while. Like he couldn't believe I did it, after months and months of sleep deprivation and repeating every single day what he wanted, I finally done it. 

Well... It wasn't enough. He asked for more. He begged for more. I begged him to stop being a jerk. Told him how terrible it was. 

He used his kind, loving, supporting voice again, and repeated that deep down, he knew I wanted this, and knew it would please me next time, because he knew me better than anyone. He asked me to trust him. 

I slept with 4 other guys for him. Took no pleasure in it, only shame and sadness, those were terrible, traumatizing moments. Ten years later, I can't believe I let all of this happen. It seems like another me, in another life. 

One time he even planned a threesome with an older random man on an app, as a surprise for my birthday??? I said ""definitely no, won't happen"", and he tried to guilt me, saying how disappointed this man will be, that it's already set... Creep. At least I dodged this bullet. 

I was dumber than dumb. But I was so young, around 18, and I really wanted him to be ""the one"". I never wanted to fix him. I wanted to fix the relationship, so that we could be happy again . 

All I ever wanted was to get to hear his cheerful voice again. I wanted him to be his normal self, the fun, loving guy I knew he could be, because he was at first. This ""shy geek"" who was my best friend since I was 12.

Grieving people that are still alive is so hard. 
Unloving someone is so hard. 

I'm so glad I'm not in love with him since years now, so the spell is gone, and I blocked this asshole. 

I saw him last year though, he swore we would only see each other as childhood friends, not as exes. He made me feel silly for thinking otherwise, saying stuff like ""come on, we were merely high-school sweathearts, we're both adults now who moved on with our lives, and can see each other as friends"" 

Then he tried to rape me and said ""I wanted to test your boundaries"" sooo I'm all about second chances and all, but I'm done for life with this guy. Some people don't change one bit, even years later

I wish I could have seen the abuse earlier. I feel lighter just being able to talk about this now. ",2024-08-01 23:27:16,2025-03-17 03:25:06,violence

I am exactly one month free from his control and violence; the bruises have left my body, and I won‚Äôt lie and tell you it isn‚Äôt hard because it is!

I'd rather sleep in a car if I had one than go to a shelter at 52

he treats me the way I would never treat any person or even animal.

I hate he‚Äôs made me such a miserable angry person. Can‚Äôt we all just love one another. Why is res so easy to give and impossible for me to obtain?

He‚Äôs hacked all of her accounts. Got into her google and her Facebook. He has posted nasty things about her on fb making it look as if she posted it. He‚Äôs sent out a sec video of them to EVERYONE! Her father, brothers, even a random hairstylist in our small town. About a month ago her house burned down. He happened to drive by while it was happening.. not as if he was just in the neighborhood. He lives about 40 miles away from her. At this time I knew it was him that burned her house down. Idk why.. I just felt it. She hadn‚Äôt yet excepted the fact that he did this. Until, about a week later she stayed at a friends (being homeless now) that night she was afraid. So her and her friend left and went and stayed at her friends sisters two towns over instead. That night, her friends RV burns to the ground. Where they were supposed to be sleeping.. Again, police were called. Nothing was done. They took a report and nobody heard another word about it. Now she has her own place and got a new phone to try and keep him from tracking and finding her. Well he found her. He sent out more sec videos. He pulled up late about a week ago and went around the back of the house. Knocked a small hole in her bedroom window and threw a lit flare inside. Caught the wall and curtains on fire. She was at work but her room mate was there and heard a noise. Luckily he was able to put out the fire and then run outside to see her EX BOYFRIEND jumping in the driver seat of his ex wife‚Äôs vehicle and hauling ass away. Again, cops were called. They said there was nothing they could do. 
Now I need to mention that in between the fire events her ex also showed up at her mothers and loosened her dads lug nuts in the middle of the night. Tried to break into her son a rv on her mom‚Äôs property and the neighbor saw him. When the neighbor yelled her ex jumped on his motorcycle, hauled ass. A red car comes around the corner, hits a deer launching at her ex KNOCKING HIM OFF HIS BIKE and he ends up being rushed to the er with bad injuries. Cops were called again. Now they have more witnesses and more proof he‚Äôs doing these things. Unfortunately the cops said they can‚Äôt do much. Maybe a trespassing citation. But since nobody saw him loosen the lug nuts , there was nothing they can do. He has in the passed week snuck up
To her house and busted out her back windshield TWICE! In the last week! Costing her $299. Each time!! Cops called and still nothings been done. She has forwarded their messages to the police and tried everything. This is happening in south Texas. Why on gods earth are the police not doing anything? That wreck he was in, shouldn‚Äôt that have been feeing the seen of a crime since he was running from getting caught on her mom‚Äôs property? With witnesses!! What about the two fires and the flare? Is this not enough evidence! Shouldn‚Äôt that be assault with a deadly weapon? Arson? What in gods name is going on here???

Last night, my boyfriend of three months, his brother and his sister in law were playing pool and having some beers. BF was quiet the whole night but we were play fighting on and off. He is a lot bigger and stronger than me but we do play fight frequently no worries, in a kind of affectionate way. 

Last night however when things were wrapping up, we were gently play fighting and his whole face suddenly changed and he threw me onto the ground and I hit a table. Even his own brother asked me if I was ok. We finished the game and little was said but obviously the mood had dramatically changed. He left with his brother and I stayed with SIL for a bit and became a bit tearful from the fright I got and she agreed it was bad and his out of the blue throwing me was shocking and scary. 

Queue going to bed after. He denies throwing me and says I just slipped, basically gaslighting me. Argument continues, he agrees he hurt me but it was an accident and ‚Äúhe just gets angry sometimes‚Äù. Unsure what to do or think, I really love this guy and he‚Äôs the only person I‚Äôve genuinely thought about marrying - this has quite literally thrown me.

1dayg6h,How to start from scratch after escaping domestic violence?,daniunicorn99,8,3,https://i.redd.it/nei4nekc9b5d1.png,"Hey reddit here's my first post ever üëÄ anyways... have you ever had an ex make you look bad in front of the entirety of the world and if so how did you somewhat fix your reputation? For context: I used to vouch for my ex and stayed silent for over a year about the abuse because I had faith he would improve and change because he claimed to ""love me"" and promised to ""do better"" (lol spoiler alert he never did, the abuse only got worse) my ex also stole all my money and stalked me after I broke up with him multiple times. He pawned off and sold most of my stuff behind my back including presents from my late grandmother and my baptism necklace. He would spend all my money on his casino and drug addictions.He stole my middle school trumpet too and all my apple devices (I'm now an android girly again üëâüëà) He knew what these sentimental items meant to me but he didnt care. I seem to be in the clear but I wanted to hear from others on this topic. I would encourage you guys not to victim blame - that I should have known better and recognized his red flags sooner but he was an expert manipulator, pathological liar, egotistical narcissistic who lovebombed me in the beginning to coerce me to do things I never felt comfortable with. He bullied me and I can go on and on about everything because I am actually considering starting a podcast to share my experience to educate the public. Sorry I'm rambling but anyway he would accuse me of being a snitch but he never deserved my loyalty in the first place. He would also accuse me of cheating and get extremely possessive and jealous which I never did. I think he was projecting his insecurities I'm pretty sure he cheated on me with multiple people which btw idgaf about lol I'm just glad I got outta that situation. There have been multiple warrants for his arrest he has burned bridges with a lot of people. When my friends and family did background checks on him he convinced me he was an innocent victim of the American Justice system as a Cuban immigrant. I call bullshit on that one. He is a conartist from Havana who managed to get a green card and makes his living scamming families all over Florida. He lied to me about everything. I have so much tea to expose on this man. But tbh I just want to be safe and not let my anger cloud my better judgment. I recently logged in to my old airbnb account and have negative reviews from hosts because he would steal from their properties without me noticing. I accepted responsibility but it's tough knowing that I never did these things. I was raised differently. I was never in an abusive relationship before. I was raised in a loving household. I didn't know how to establish boundaries with this man because I never had to before. Thank God my family took me back home and forgave me. What do you guys think? Any feedback would be appreciated even constructive criticism. A domestic abuse hotline told me that I don't deserve to feel guilty because nobody gets into a relationship thinking their significant other will abuse them. I trusted the wrong person but I chose to end the abuse by walking away. ",2024-06-08 08:45:21,2025-03-17 03:26:21,violence

Your responses have been very helpful.

Hi everyone, me (30 f) and my boyfriend (30) have been together for about a year. I'm seriously considering breaking up with him, since the relationship is emotionally abusive. He can be extremely sweet at times, but then switches and becomes cruel, condescending and aggressive (punching walls, shouting, throwing a blanket in my face) in the way he behaves and talks to me. During one of those instances, I slapped his arm after he said something particularly hurtful. It was about something that he knew was very sensitive. However, I don't think I was right to slap him and I apologized profusely. I'd never done something like that before, in any relationship. I was genuinely shocked by my own reaction. He put his face a few centimetres away from mine and told me that if I ever did that again, he would punch me in the face as hard as he could. That he would beat me down and that he didn't care that I'm a woman. I didn't really react to it as I was terrified.

Now I'm asking myself if I should be worried about a possible escalation of violence in the future, especially if/when I break up with him? Did I 'deserve' this reaction or was it not ok?",2023-07-13 22:23:39,2025-03-17 03:26:22,violence

We got together when I was 19 and a freshman in college.. The red flags were everywhere but he was my first serious relationship. I was homeschooled and never had any relationships prior because of how strict my mom was.. So I was oblivious to everything happening.. Started off with insulting me..and then ‚Äúplay fighting‚Äù which always ended up with him throwing me against walls..He then started forcing me to do sexual things with him and would threaten to break up with me if I didn‚Äôt..He was always talking to other girls during this time, and me not having any support from anyone, I didn‚Äôt want to lose him and gave in to everything he wanted.. When I moved out (got kicked out due to going to a concert with him overnight without an adult..told you my mom was strict).. The abuse got worse. He was now choking me, throwing me hard against walls, throwing me down on the ground and yelling in my face..Hitting me‚Ä¶And then‚Ä¶he raped me.. His family and mom knew because they witnessed it, but the mom was the leader of the pack and didn‚Äôt want her son going to jail‚Ä¶She threatened me instead that she would have police come for me..that she had good lawyers that would take me down‚Ä¶

After 3 years of the abuse, I finally got strong.. got accepted to a good university near me, made friends, and enjoyed life..He and his family didn‚Äôt like that..But I didn‚Äôt care.. I was mean, but had to be and broke up with him..which led to a month of him threatening to kill himself, storm my place and destroy my stuff..but I blocked him and moved on..

Issue is‚Ä¶The nightmares..the flashbacks..the triggers‚Ä¶ Im trying to find a therapist to help but they‚Äôre all expensive and don‚Äôt take my insurance.. I want to report him but because I waited so long, I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ He lied to a family friend of mine, and turned him against me..

His family still follows me on Facebook..especially the one that doesn‚Äôt know anything about what happened.. and I just wanted to tell them everything..

The police will not tell the person that you have enquired about this or notify them that their domestic violence history has been disclosed to you.

Edit to add: you can also request the information if you're concerned about a loved one

Second edit: Someone kindly shared their story about having their reputation ruined by an ex who has erased his criminal record of the domestic violence. Please be aware that while police reports about previous DV incidents are helpful to know about, not finding any evidence of prior violence shouldn't serve as an automatic reassurance that a person is harmless or honest.

1ddjlz2,Escaping Domestic Violence Without Resources,ThrowULPT_DV,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ddjlz2/escaping_domestic_violence_without_resources/,"*Note: This post was written for the*¬†r/UnethicalLifeProTips *sub,¬†for reasons which I feel become clear from the contents, but I have currently been unable to post there due to automod and she's desperate for any help. Thank you for reading*

ULPT Members, I come to you today with a simple request: Help my friend escape her abusive home situation without reporting her abuser.

Context: I have a very dear friend, 38F, who for the sake of this post we'll call Jenny. Jenny has had an extremely difficult life. Her biological family was various shades of neglectful and abusing, and at age 10 when she did what she was supposed to do (reach out to the adults responsible for her and ask for help) due to SA at home, she was removed from the home and placed in the foster care system where the abuse only worsened. All of this to give context that

* Jenny is deeply untrusting of CPS and authorities in general
* Jenny has been conditioned to believe that the terrible things done to her are her fault, and that talking makes it worse
* Jenny has for much of her life attracted abusers who sense her vulnerability and prey on it.

Now, at 38, Jenny is a mother of 2 small children and is entirely dependent upon their abusive father. This man (we'll call him POS) has abused her financially, emotionally, mentally, physically and sexually for the majority of their relationship. Jenny has finally reached her breaking point and has ended her relationship with this man, but as we all know, physically leaving an abusive asshole is another kettle of fish entirely. The abuse has ramped up since she stood up to him, and I have absolutely no doubts that if she's still in POS's house in 3 months, she'll soon be in the ground, either because he put there or because he drove her to do it herself.

Jenny has no education and no financial resources. She has work experience and has worked entry level jobs (mostly fast food) but is currently unemployed. She has no safety net to speak of. She desperately wants to escape, but is utterly unwilling to report POS, for the dual reason that she is reliant on his income to care for her children (he can't go to jail, he has to go to work) and that she has a massive, trauma fueled fear that CPS will take her babies away and they'll live through the same horrors that she experienced.

Our current plan is to have her, during her next WIC visit, speak to their access person and claim that her boyfriend no longer wants to be with her and is kicking her out in order to try and secure a fast track to emergency government housing, but I simply worry this won't be enough with her unwilling to discuss her abuse. After all, there's a ton of competition for these resources.

Aside from the obvious (introducing POS to a tire iron), ULPT community, I need you to go out of character for a minute and do the most ethical thing at all, help this wonderful woman escape an abusive home. Sex work is off the table (it was discussed, she will not be an object again, even transactionally) but otherwise, any method of attaining short term housing, building resources that can't be taken away, and just starting to build a life for herself are welcome. All ideas will be considered. Life has shit on this beautiful soul every moment of her life, please help me lift her up to attain basic human dignity. Also, if anyone who DOES work in the DV/CPS/LE systems has any insight into what she CAN talk about with ZERO fear of a criminal case being opened, that would be huge insight as well. Thank you so much for your time and your help everyone.",2024-06-11 17:19:29,2025-03-17 03:26:30,violence

Now that it‚Äôs over I see a lot of things differently. However I still have trouble labelling a lot of the stuff he did to me. On a few occasions he said very scary things, now I ask myself whether this is abuse? 
Once he slapped me ‚Äúas a joke‚Äù just out of the blue when he was drunk. I thought it was disrespectful but not necessarily abusive.
Another time he told me that he wanted to kidnap me and that he knew how to hide a body if he ever wanted to kill someone. 
He also described how he wanted to slit me open, let me bleed out and take my organs out of my body and when I said that I used to trust him and that these jokes scared me he laughed and said ‚Äúyour fault‚Äù.
On another occasion I trusted him with some of my very scary nightmares I suffer from in which I get tortured and murdered. He said that that thought kind off turned him on and when I answered that this was not okay at all, he called me the weird one for having these dreams in the first place. 
His ‚Äújokes‚Äù weren‚Äôt just about me, he also fantasised about dissecting a human being or joked about wanting to sleep with the eight year old sister of his friend. 
Honestly I don‚Äôt know where to place any of this. All of it was always just jokes and mostly out of the blue and nothing like - ‚Äúif you cross me I‚Äôll kill you‚Äù in an argument. 
So is this abuse or just someone who has very very very poor taste in jokes?",2023-07-04 12:40:49,2025-03-17 03:26:32,violence
117r21s,Is throwing objects an early sign of potential further violence?,jkraycray72918,14,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/117r21s/is_throwing_objects_an_early_sign_of_potential/,"I've recently left my girlfriend completely. NC and blocked. She had a lot of mental health issues it seemed, and was also an alcoholic. I'd broken up with her many times due to her bad actions and emotional abuse towards me, but was trying to allow her to show me she was working on changing (she'd promised many things, but always failed, sadly). I had told her it was the only way I'd consider coming back to the relationship was long term signs of real change (like no more lying, stop drinking, etc.).

One of the last times I saw her she was drunk in her apartment. She was angry I wouldn't sleep with her and wouldn't return to the relationship right then and there (mind you, I had told her many times I'd never sleep with her if she was drunk, and she had also promised she'd stop drinking as she'd usually become abusive).

During this time, she threw things all over her room, stormed around the apartment raising her voice, and slammed the door behind her. It was very tantrum like. The whole time I froze and calmly asked ""please stop?""

Being around her drunk had already scared me. But then her throwing around items in her house made me frightened too (nothing hit me).

**Is throwing things an early sign of further more physical abuse? Was I right to see these things as a major warning sign?**

For additional support, in the past she had told me her prior long term boyfriend sometimes had to restrain her as there would be some element of physical *something* between them, but I never got full on details... which made me think she would get physical with him (or vice versa).

With me, she had been drunk in the past in a *tantrum* like state and tried to kick at me (kind of like a child, but still made me uncomfortable, felt like *attack-ish*). One time she randomly bit me so hard on my shoulder it turned deep purple with a bruise. Would call me names, try to humiliate me, once spat in my home, etc.

During all of her outbursts, I always remained composed and tried to calm her down with kindness and support. I guess sometimes *freezing* but trying to remain collected - no yelling on my end, or anything. A few times she asked why I would never yell at her, never call her names or anything, she asked how I was always in control... She even said she wished I'd lose it on her; but I never would.

It almost felt like she wanted me to blow up. She did once tell me that during her ""drunken outburst"" she ""wanted to see how far she could push me"" - which made me feel even more that a lot of this behavior was on purpose.

Again, I have since left the relationship as of a month and a half ago, but a lot still haunts me.",2023-02-21 01:44:32,2025-03-17 03:26:33,violence
1bmxmvw,Subtle threats of violence,Round_Let7773,6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1bmxmvw/subtle_threats_of_violence/,"I just need to vent even if its into a void.

About half a year ago my boyfriend assaulted me sexually and physically. He was also very abusive for months on end emotionally. He even threatened to kill my family in graphic detail. Since then, I have had bad PTSD and have had a drinking problem. I know that I should have left. My family situation is complicated and I am financially dependent on him, so I have many excuses as to why I am still living with him.
Anyways, he has been kind and sweet to me usually. I have been working on staying sober. However, sometimes I slip up and drink to forget that trauma. When this happens , we always fight. Last night I told him that I hated him and threw a shoe at him. I feel horrible and I know this is abusive of me. I apologized but he demanded I leave our apartment. I have no where to go or to stay, and I also was in no condition to leave. So I said no.
He then said ‚Äúyou know what happened last time when you didnt leave,‚Äù.
Referencing a time when he pointed a gun at me in his car when I was crying and begging him to let me stay. 

He apologized and said it was because he just wanted me to leave and he thought ‚ÄúI knew he didnt have a gun anymore.‚Äù 

This apology seems like bullshit. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have drank and me escalating the situation was wrong and abusive. But I just feel like him implying that threat and mentioning the trauma that even started my drinking in the first place is evil. He is mad that I am so hurt even though I initiated the fight. To me, this confirms my anxiety that I am not safe and that he hasnt changed. Am I crazy? :(

I‚Äôll try to keep this as concise as I can.
My mom and sister got away from my dad around this time last year. My dad is a narcissist who had kept us all in a bubble for over 20 years. My mom finally got the courage and willpower to leave. She told him she was leaving, he agreed to pay her 500$ every paycheck. I was there when this happened.
My mom has been disabled for over 20 years and unable to get a regular job. She was a stay at home mom while my dad worked and supported the family with a long distance job. She tried numerous times to start her own businesses but he always shut it down. 
My mom took my sister, who has an intellectual disability, with her. My dad was abusive to us kids as well and there was no chance of her staying or even wanting to stay. I didn‚Äôt have the capacity to take them in, and they fled to another state to family, basically homeless. They packed up only what they could fit in the car and left. A year later, my mom and sister are living in a camper that is falling apart. My dad refuses to send any money.
He finally sent the divorce papers and he‚Äôs demanding alimony, money in times of hardship (ha. Ha.) he accused her of cheating, and he‚Äôs demanding profits from any business she starts in the future.
My mom and sister have nothing. I am sick to my stomach. Is there anything I can do or advise my mom to do? My dad lives in a completely paid off house that has its own water supply. He hardly has any bills and doesn‚Äôt have any pets. There is no question that he is a disgusting monster. I won‚Äôt detail everything he‚Äôs done over the years, but this is his way of punishing her for leaving. She doesn‚Äôt have the money for a lawyer. The ice storm recently destroyed the top of the camper they were living in. If anyone sees this please help. Any advice is appreciated.

EDIT: sorry tl;dr is there any way she can counter the demands in his divorce papers? He has the money for a lawyer because he took everything",2024-02-06 14:16:10,2025-03-17 03:26:45,violence

1bauanp,His destruction of property and eventual violence towards people,Alinda_,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1bauanp/his_destruction_of_property_and_eventual_violence/,"Was thinking about this lately after a recent incident with my ex. Let me preface this by saying I‚Äôm already in no-contact with him and I fortunately was never physically abused by him.

I wanted to list out the things he‚Äôs attacked or destroyed during our relationship and after (that I know about):

- Punched a U-Haul truck door after getting frustrated with the company
- Punched his steering wheel and violently made a U-turn when we got into an argument that almost led to a breakup (about him calling me selfish for me wanting to lose a mere 15 lbs because I would lose my curves, which he tried to gaslight me about.) To be fair, I initiated the argument because I was so bothered about it, and we were on our way to celebrate Christmas with his family, so it was pretty stressful. Doesn‚Äôt excuse his actions though.
- Destroyed and had to replace an expensive drill that he used for work because he was frustrated at something work-related. He works in a field where people have a toxic masculinity mindset, and some of his coworkers also seem to have destructive behavior. Ex blamed it on testosterone despite the fact that many people with high T can control their behaviors.
- Pulled off and dented a closet door that kept getting stuck at our apartment
- Pulled out and broke our kitchen sink hose, which would potentially cost us hundreds if the maintenance people weren‚Äôt able to fix it or if there was water damage (fortunately it was fine)
- Pulled off the top ‚Äúshelf‚Äù of the blinders for our sliding door. Not sure what it‚Äôs called, but he was frustrated about it after he broke the sink hose. (Btw, I was honest to the maintenance people about how all the things broke because they asked. They seemed concerned for me after I did.)
- Destroyed a tissue box during one of our arguments. Probably the most minor thing he‚Äôs destroyed tbh.
- Totaled his first car because he was upset that my friend (who he hates because she tipped me off to the fact that he was abusive, and who he claimed was a ‚Äúwitch whispering into my ear‚Äù) said that he didn‚Äôt look like somebody who went to the gym. Yup, that was it. From what I understood, he was on a merging lane, and instead of letting the other car merge, he tried to speed past them, causing the accident. He blamed the other driver and let everyone else believe so, even though he was 100% at fault. He said he was fuming about me telling him what my friend had said and that was the reason he had such a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù attitude that day.
- Got into another accident with his second car because he was aggressively tailgating. Other driver also had road rage and ended up purposely(?) bumping into his car, causing it to make a 180 spin. Not entirely his fault, but it‚Äôs so easy to just not tailgate.
- Attacked the beams at his dad‚Äôs house with a hammer because he was going manic. He recently got fired and was frustrated about his life and our breakup. (I was still talking to him because I hoped we could be friends and that he needed support during rough times.) He made a nonchalant comment about how our dog looked so terrified after the event. She used to go to me for comfort when he yelled. He loves her and I hope she‚Äôll be fine, but I feel like a terrible person for leaving her with him and would never forgive myself if something happened to her. She‚Äôs probably the only thing my ex loves right now.
- And probably the worst offense - he attacked his dad to the point where his dad needed to visit a hospital. He wasn‚Äôt completely battered and was just ‚Äúroughed up‚Äù, but I think he dislocated something in his shoulder/clavicle area? Ex was angry that his dad left the door open and the dog ran off (because she was scared of him yelling). She came back home after 5+ hours. His dad protected him by telling the hospital he got into a minor car accident. When I asked my ex if they called the cops out of shock of what he did, his response was, ‚ÄúNo. Why? Are you going to?‚Äù

When my friends and family were concerned about me because of his violence, I always told them his physical aggression was never directed towards people. Everyone says destruction towards objects often leads to violence towards people, and it was true in his case. He said he would never attack me, but he has promised and lied about so much of his behavior that I have zero reason to believe that.

When I expressed my and my family‚Äôs concern, instead of being understanding, his response was something like, ‚Äúschool shooters are the kids treated like they were going to become one.‚Äù It sounded like a threat.

And of course, instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he blames me and everyone else for ‚Äúwhat he‚Äôs become‚Äù. No, dude, you‚Äôre just an angry, abusive asshole and it‚Äôs all on you. Plain and simple.",2024-03-09 22:35:47,2025-03-17 03:26:47,violence

About six months ago my 7 yr old daughter‚Äôs dad went to jail for domestic violence against me. My daughter was exposed to the violence from him. I called the cops on him. He went to jail. 
Anyways, my point I‚Äôm getting to is that a CPS case was opened against him and me. It was open because he exposed our daughter to violence. I tried doing the right thing by calling the cops trying to protect my daughter. Anyhow, now CPS is wanting me to take domestic violence treatment, even though I‚Äôm the victim in the case and never caught a charge. I feel like it‚Äôs unfair and that I should not have to because I did protect my daughter from the violence by calling the cops. They told me that I should‚Äôve known better because this has happened in the past once before. I told them I had faith in him and wanted him to be in our daughters life and that‚Äôs why I gave him a second chance and that I did not choose to be in a domestic abuse relationship. My attorney has not spoken up for me at all, now they want me to do treatment for DV, therapy, and all kinds of other things. 
To top it off he is out of jail now, under the influence of meth. CPS has not set up any treatment plan for him. And they are still allowing two visits per week with her dad supervised and I feel like it should not be allowed until he follows through with treatment and make some progress. 
Is this right or am I crazy?

My live-in-partner has been jobless for years, and all he does all day is play online games on his desktop computer (that I bought), and he barely helps out with the house chores.

He would call me and the kids (his own kids) stupid. He would curse at us. He would threaten to hurt me physically. He would hurt me psychologically in front of my kids.

I don't want to look sorry, so I often stand my ground. I would show him I am not scared of him. He doesn't like that.

I am already exhausted from working alone to provide for my family. I earn a lot, but in exchange, I have to work the night shift, and for more than three years now.

Lately, I haven't been able to sleep well, and it's already affecting my health. I can feel it.

Then just today, he physically hurt me, pulled my hair hard. Right in front of my kids. All this because I confronted him that he should stop stressing the kids out.

He plays this MIR4 almost 24/7 and he would force my kids to pilot his account that it has been interfering with their school work.

I made the wrong move to a narcissist. They hate being confronted and they hate it even more when the other party is right.

I am losing my sanity slowly. I would often think of different scenarios on how I would end my life. Somehow it makes me feel relaxed, just thinking that everything will be over the moment I do it.

All the pain, all the sufferings. I would no longer feel stressed about the future. I would no longer feel scared.

I know I need to leave, but somehow, I am just exhausted and scared to face the world alone. I don't know what else to do.",2023-07-01 14:09:20,2025-03-17 03:26:53,violence
ra6dpv,"I left a year ago, today. My Domestic Violence story",Murky-Breadfruit-883,93,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/ra6dpv/i_left_a_year_ago_today_my_domestic_violence_story/,"A year ago today, I left my abusive ex. He covertly abused me for a long time. I had a digital Trail of me reaching out to his family, since 2014. Asking them to help me with his abusive Behavior. I went on a domestic violence leave of absence, at two different jobs, within two years. I had wanted to leave for a long time, but I had nowhere to go. When I was pregnant with our son, my ex's mother asked me if my ex had ever hit me. However, he didn't become physically abusive, until after our son was born. Seems she didn't care after our son was born, because when I called her, and texted her about the abuse she ignored me. He would shove, grab, hold me down, and tossed me across the room.
 He shoved me into two coffee tables, and a coat rack. In 2018, he pulled me by my hair while I was sitting on the floor, and our two-year-old son was in my lap. On the weekend of July 4th, 2020 he even abused me under his family's nose, at a lake house, in Wisconsin. After drinking the whole day, and his family sleeping, he said he was going to take our child out for a drive, to help lull him to sleep. Even though he was intoxicated. I put my hands up to tell him no, and he pushed me into his grandparent's coffee table, after shoving me, I walked to the basement where his family all slept to get away from him. Surrounded by his sleeping family members on couches, and cots, he hurled several couch pillows at my face very hard. He then proceeded to rip apart my gym bag until it was in pieces. Many nights he kicked me out of the house, and put a chair in front of the door. I either had to call my mom to have her pick me up, or wait for him to change his mind. He threatened to kick me out, if I didn't have sex with him. He said he expected a significant other, and not a roommate. When he tried to initiate sex, I cried, and told him I didn't want him to touch me. He yanked me off of the bed, and proceeded to get a baseball bat and beat the bedroom furniture with it, all the while screaming at the top of his lungs. He blocked the doors, and prevented me from leaving the house. He called me horrific names. He called me a ""nasty cunt"" on my 34th birthday, while he held our child in his arms. He told me, "" I jerk off to women who are uglier than you, online"" He threatened to kill himself more times than I can count. He drunkenly waved two large kitchen knives around the living room talking about suicide on this day. He would leave pornographic websites on his phone, and leave it lying around the house, for our son to come across it trying to play games on his phone. He did all of this in front of our child!
On October, 26th, 2020 three days after my son's 4th birthday. My ex had shoved me into our coat rack, and it fell on top of me. This is when I decided to come back to Jesus, I became a born-again Christian when I was 18 years old, after fleeing my mom's ex-husband, who gave me a black eye. I moved in with my aunt and uncle, who are Christians, and I didn't quite understand it. I just thought it was another religion. I bowed my head down, and asked Jesus into my heart, truly believing he was real. It was then, that I felt changed. However, I hadn't been walking with God for a long time at this point. I knew he was my only way out, I ran to my Bible, and I cried and prayed. The Lord led me to apply for a DV residency program again, I was denied residency for the program, in 2019.
On this day, my ex committed an act of domestic violence harassment. To which he was later charged and arrested, last year, Christmas Day. We looked like a happy family on Instagram, and among some of our friends. At this time I was so sad, and broken, that I was in denial. I was conditioned for so long to think it was my fault, and that I deserve to be treated this way. I actually thought that I deserved to be treated this way.
It wasn't until my ex, drove drunk with our child on this day, last year,
That I finally realized my power.
Being a great mom, is the only thing I really know how to be. Endangering my baby boy, is all it took for me to leave.
With the amazing help, and that extra push from my brother, who was, and is still my rock. My brother received a call from me about 2 a.m, and I told him how much my ex has been drinking, and after listening to this advice, I called the police. When my ex had returned he confessed to driving drunk with our son.
I caught that on an audio recording.
My brother picked me up, my ex didn't allow me to take our son with me. I stayed the night at my mother's house, and my small family helped me devise a safety plan to leave. My ex was off work for an extra day and wouldn't let me have my son. He went to work 3rd shift on¬† Thursday, December, 10 2020.
I took my son to my mom's house.
I drove back to my ex's apartment and packed several bags of toys, my stuff.
Toothbrushes, toothpaste, vitamins and blankets.
Early the next morning I texted my ex,
""I want you to know that as a friend, I will always love you. I want you to get help.""
The very next morning 7am, my brother watched my son, and I took my audio recordings, and went and filed for a civil restraining order, afterwards, I went to the bank, and removed my name from our Joint bank account. Keeping my private checking account I had, with about $900.00 to last me.
I had nowhere to go, and I hadn't recieved word if I had been accepted into the DV program, yet.
My mom cleans houses for a living and I was friend's with one of her clients.
Her client had a large, and nice basement apartment she offered for my son and I to stay with her, without hesistsion. She's an amazing women. My son and I owe her son much. She let us stay there from December, 12-January 11th.
While we were living there, I had to go back to court for a civil protection orders hearing. On December, 23rd. TESSA, a local domestic violence program helped me obtain a free protection order attorney. I was able to keep my civil protection order for 6 more months, but was expected to co-parent with my ex. My ex got my son back for one day on December, 23rd-24th. My protection order attorney informed me that one of my exhibits on my phone was a crime, and there was enough evidence for a domestic violence harrasment charge, and that I should report it to the police right away.
I did so, on Christmas morning when I had my son back with me. Later, Chrsitmas evening, my ex was arrested. He spent an entire weekend in jail.
I was present over the phone for his trial, on Monday morning.
He had to pay $1000.00 for his crime and could not contact me, whatsoever.
He told the judge he had a civil court agreement to see his son. The judge asked me if I was comfortable with this agreement. I told the judge, not right now. He's been abusing me for years. Judge said, okay,
 That's that, no contact order it is.
 A Mandatory Protection order was put in place.
With 2 protection orders and a temporary place to live, I spent the next month budgeting my money, having my son sign onto remote pre-school classes. I took time to implement schoolwork with him. We went sledding down the neighbor's yard. We played board games, and watched movies. I spent weeks researching how to get a probono child custody attorney. As I knew it wouldn't be long before I was served custody papers. I spent nights with my laptop, listening to hours of abusive recordings. Sifting through them to see what would be most useful for custody court. I cried really hard afterwards. It took a toll on me.
I met with my son's pediatrician and told her what had happened. Giving her evidence to show her. I had to make child abuse claims through CPS with what I had. (Drunk driving, and hair pulling incident)
I researched how to best use my audio recordings for court, and I found a transcription company in Denver, they took my relevant audio recordings, and had them transcribed for court. They included my ex texting me saying that he called me 50 times, I must need therapy. And a court certified transcribe audio recording, of him admitting to drinking and driving with our son.
I prayed that I would receive an email from the DV program, telling me I was accepted. After strenuous research and uploading evidence. I was accepted by a local program called, ""The Justice Center."" I was approved for an attorney, however, it could take up to 6 weeks to find one.
We moved our stuff into the DV program on Monday January, 11th 2021.
I walked into a fully furnished apartment.
Modern (matching)¬† furniture. A flat-screen, smart TV, a colorful bathroom, and two beds.
I walked into my very first ever apartment, without my ex. I knew then, that my son and I were going to be safe. I cried so hard, but they were happy tears. I couldn't remember the last time I cried out of happiness. I didn't have to worry about what I was wearing, what I was talking about, whether or not I would say something the wrong way, or try to stick up for myself. Finally, I was safe, and I could rest. Both my son, and I experienced weeks of nightmares, and hyperarousal. I had dreams of a man, family member, that was not my ex, but he was trying to kill me and my son. My son, had dreams of daddy killing himself in the head with a knife, I was able to audio record it, and use that for court as well. After the dreams seemed to dissipate after a couple weeks, I got myself into counseling, but could not yet get my son into play therapy as we were currently beginning our custody dispute. I was served with child custody papers, and my ex, and his attorney, and my ex's wealthy, and enabling family issued an emergency motion for temporary orders hearing. He claimed I was an emergency, and I had no place to live, and that my son was not being taken care of. He lied on his child Custody petition lying about why he was arrested, among everything else. Before I even had an attorney, I was already prepared. Without an attorney, and by myself, I issued a response to his petition, as well as filing several exhibits with my response. I had a note from my son's pediatrician, stating that I told her about the abuse since 2018, and she stated that she's never even met my ex. Who is the father of our child. I filed the confession of drunk driving, and transcription form, and that was merely a taste of what I had. I had, and still have 40 to 50 audio recordings of abuse. My ex and his family. I know that they spent thousands, and thousands of dollars. I had so much evidence that I did not spend a dime. Our custody case was approved a court-ordered child, and family investigator. Her report reflected all of my claims, and evidence. When we came out of custody court, eight months later, I I was able to obtain the one thing I wanted, sole legal decision-making. I was able to take steps through our stipulated parenting plan, to ensure that my child would be safe. The child and family investigator called me and told me that it was women like me who are the reason that she does what she does. She told me that I did absolutely everything right as a good mother protecting her child.
I wanted to leave since 2019, I fell for the crocodile tears, the promises to change, and get help, the pleas for another chance. I never would have allowed a man to treat me this way, because I grew up getting beaten by a grown man as a teenager, and watching my mom get beat, too. Abuse is slow, it is subtle, it is Progressive. You don't even know what's happening, until it gets so bad. It starts off with a little bit of control here, and there. Abusers will test you, to see what you will tolerate, and the more you tolerate, the worse the abuse gets. Lundy Bancroft has saved my life, I'm all over those red flags now. I am setting great examples for my son. I'm in college, I can stay at My residency for another four years, and I'm going to continue being the best mom that I am.

I believe he feels threatened I can send him away from home since now, sadly from an inheritance also of a rental place, I'm in a position to pay rent/bills/expenses both for me and my daughter, and for my pregnancy.

I was angry because it's been a year since my mother passed away from suicide and she was heavily abusive, it triggers me to come back to her birth home where my grandparents live. 

I saved some photos when I went there after the funeral a year ago, I was living with my in-laws and been asking to have those photos back for a year now... I have reasons to think they lost them for good. 

Again I was angry because next week it's the first anniversary and those are all the photos I have left and may now be gone. I told him I wouldn't want his family at my house (they can see my daughter whenever, but never come visit my city which is 30mins top from theirs) and maybe not even him. If he's not emotionally abusive, he literally hits me.

So completely unpredictably as I wasn't yelling or anything, he started hitting me and pushing me. 

Told me 'now that I have money I think I'm something, but I was crying before' don't know how to translate this, he refers to how I struggled with being poor and/or as far as I could from my mother, because she as well (but far worse) hit me from when I was a toddler.

I feel numb. I'm going with him at the gyno to know our baby's gender next Wednesday. 

My father is happy because he thinks I'm in a good place, he's 78.

13yrzq1,TW: physical violence. I‚Äôm aroused by pain now because violent episodes with my abusive ex often led to really gratifying sex,throwaway756405,9,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/13yrzq1/tw_physical_violence_im_aroused_by_pain_now/,"I feel like my brain‚Äôs been broken somehow. I guess I just want someone else to tell me they‚Äôve also experienced this, so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm permanently damaged. 

My ex would get randomly violent for the smallest things when we‚Äôd be having discussions. One moment we‚Äôd be talking calmly, and the next I would say something he didn‚Äôt like, his face would darken, and he‚Äôd attack me. He‚Äôd hit me or shove me or do something else that would be obviously really painful. 

And often, right afterwards, we‚Äôd go straight into having sex. He never forced me. I would somehow just find myself really aroused right after he attacked me, and I often found those sexual encounters really gratifying. 

That‚Äôs already fucked up, but since I finally made myself leave, I‚Äôve been missing those sexual encounters after the attacks so much it feels like an addiction. 

In my sexual encounters since, I‚Äôve been really turned on by rough sex and pain during sex. I guess it reminds me of how sex with him felt, when I‚Äôd still be terrified and shocked and in pain from wherever he hit me, and somehow that sex was better and more intense. 

The other day, this guy I‚Äôve been casually seeing was in my house, and he walked into the room right as I was leaving it. We didn‚Äôt see each other, and he knocked right into me and I fell pretty hard against the doorknob. It knocked the wind out of me and hurt like hell. 

But as he was apologising and asking me if I was okay, I recovered from the shock of falling and suddenly I was so turned on and I just wanted to jump him. 

It‚Äôs like this horrible pathway has been forced open in my brain and I can‚Äôt close it. And now a part of me wants to ask him if he would hit me because I keep wondering if that will make sex afterwards feel like what I‚Äôm craving with my ex. 

I won‚Äôt, obviously, because I don‚Äôt want him to think I‚Äôm even more fucked up than he‚Äôs likely already seen, but I‚Äôm just so frustrated by all of this and it feels really shameful and terrible and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me.",2023-06-02 22:39:03,2025-03-17 03:27:03,violence

I met my boyfriend about four years ago. When we first met I was driven and a hard worker. I was working two jobs, 16 hours a week. He admired that about me. Eventually he started to complain about how little time we were spending together. He eventually asked me to move in with him after five months of dating so I wouldn‚Äôt have to two jobs. I was ecstatic and because at that point I was already falling in love with him. Since then every job I get he somehow throws a tantrum, shows up at my work, calls my work until I eventually quit. I would be at work and he would call and complain about how sick he is, how horrible of a girlfriend I am for not taking care of him.Threatening kicking me out by the time I get home. The past 4 years I‚Äôve had over 5 different jobs. I can talk for days about all the stuff we‚Äôve been through. I‚Äôm writing this because I want to leave. I‚Äôve left a couple times before, but always came back. This time I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm at a position where I can‚Äôt get up and go. I have no money, no car, no savings. About 2 weeks ago he was at the mall with his dad getting a new phone, I purposefully walked away because I knew he would try to make me join his plan. He called me and made a stupid excuse, in front of everyone he made it sound reasonable that we should be on the same plan. Not wanting to be an asshole I agreed. I don‚Äôt even have control over my phone plan. 

He‚Äôs abusive. He hits me and leaves me with bruises. He kicks me while I‚Äôm weak on the ground. He spits in my face. He dumps water over my head to degrade me even more. If I don‚Äôt want to have sex, he forces himself on me. One time he even spit in my face after he was done violating me. 
If he‚Äôs mad at me while we‚Äôre driving he‚Äôll continuously slap and punch me. He hit me so hard in the car one time my earring broke and I almost crash. He smacks me so hard in my face that my ears ring. He verbally abuses me. 

I‚Äôve been looking for another job and I‚Äôm not having any luck. Can anyone give any advice?
I can‚Äôt go to family because it‚Äôs embarrassing. They‚Äôve witnessed me leave and go back. I won‚Äôt put them through that again.

I posted this in another forum and was told I should check this one out as well so I‚Äôm posting here too to get opinions. I don‚Äôt think he is being abusive, but rather straightforward and honest. I would also love to have the opinions of males so I can see it from their perspective.

Me: So do you want me here?

Me: What is the point of having me here then?

Him: I feel like I didn‚Äôt choose you. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck with you. 

Me: Would you want your daughter to stay with someone like that?

Him: I think there is a pretty obvious answer to that. No. And if she wants to be dumb, then she better be strong. 

Me: Why would you want to be with someone you don‚Äôt love?

Him: Once you understand that men don‚Äôt get to marry the woman he falls in love with, but the woman that stays, then you‚Äôll understand. We don‚Äôt get to marry the woman we love. 

Me: Why don‚Äôt you love me?

Him: There isn‚Äôt anything wrong with you. We just aren‚Äôt compatible. The things I find disrespectful, you are just completely oblivious to and don‚Äôt give a fuck. And the things you find most important, I think are stupid. 

Me: Do you think I could make you happy?

Him: I don‚Äôt think I‚ÄôLL be able to make you happy. I don‚Äôt care if you make me happy because happiness isn‚Äôt that important to me.

After the last post I made I decided to let him back into my life and about 3 weeks later it happened again‚Ä¶. We got into an argument because he wouldn‚Äôt leave my apartment after making rude remarks towards me after drinking.

After I ran away I looked at myself in the mirror and noticed my bloody mouth and bruised forehead so I went into my room and pulled out my gun. It was unloaded so I pointed it at him telling him he needed to leave because I did not want him to attack me again. After he left I texted the police asking for assistance and they came and took pictures of my face.

1izqb6f,Am I being abused? Need help.,Much_Education83,8,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1izqb6f/am_i_being_abused_need_help/,"Hi there. I (M36) am concerned my partner (F35) is verbally and mentally abusive, but I keep going back and forth on it. I just need a way to find out for sure. FWIW, my long-term therapist says I am certainly being abused, but I don't really have any friends, so he is the only person I've ever discussed this with. I go back and forth on this, but I‚Äôd really like to hear from others who‚Äôve been through something similar. Am I overreacting? Or is this as serious as it feels? I guess I'll give some anecdotes below and see what you think? These incidents are only a small sample‚Äîthis has been a pattern for years, not just a handful of bad moments.

We've been together for 13 years and have known each other for 6 years before that. It was my first relationship, her second. Of course, everything started well. Honestly, the first 4 years or so were good/okay. Around year 6, in response to her volatile temper and our lack of a sex life (that she blamed on me, though this wasn't the case) I tried to end the relationship, asking for a break. After the 2 week break she cried a lot and we got back together.

We briefly did couples therapy after this and things were good for quite a while. Over the last 4 years or so things have gotten really bad. 

The most pervasive thing is her anger and opinion of me. She gets mad at me about anything and everything; chewing too loud, the loudness of my shoes on wood floors, being too slow to get out of her way when she walks around, etc. These small things have added up over time and I felt beat down, so I started trying to do things that I found fun, outside of time with her. She didn't like this. For example, I started running D&D games at a game store (1 day every 2 weeks), took a weekend German class (once a week), attending Comic-Con (she isn't interested in going) and eventually started a small business turning my passion into an income. She has not been supportive of any of these things, often telling me how selfish I am to do them. She makes endless small comments about how selfish I am and how hurtful she finds it that I do these things. She's also had some wild ideas around them, such as saying I'm not actually going to D&D, instead I'm going to the house of one of my players who's gay to sleep with him. Wild things.

Finally, the most serious things. We get into terrible arguments sometimes that start out of absolute nowhere and become all encompassing. It usually starts with her getting mad about something small and then claiming that I'm doing these things on purpose, that I don't understand her, that she's only mad cause I'm doing these things, etc. She gets very mentally nimble during an argument, twisting my words and making me feel confused and unsure of reality*.* These arguments often end with her screaming at me and calling me names (coward, p\*\*\*y, f\*\*\*ing idiot, stupid, telling me to shut up, etc). The pattern is then that I go take space and then she gets mad about this, claiming I should just talk things through with her, etc.

I'll give one somewhat detailed incident, though, as I write this I feel like I'm not presenting my experience very well. A few weeks ago one morning we fooled around for a while and it ended poorly (she gets very uncomfortable with sex). This was fine and I tried to be supportive. She then got very mad wondering why I was doing this when she wasn't interested (this was not the case! She was interested until the second she was not). She then got angry that the wasted time was going to result in us missing an event we were trying to go to. I said ya, some time has gone by, but let's give it a go! (it was only 10am and the event was all day). This is when things devolved and turned to me being confused and her yelling and name calling. She then declared she was leaving, going to the event on her own. Confused, I asked why she was doing that, can't we talk? She told me to get in the car if I want to talk, she's not waiting. I told her that didn't feel safe given how angry she was. She then left.

I texted her shortly after telling her I was going to take space for the rest of the day and I'd reach back out tomorrow. I was feeling really uncomfortable, anxious and scared. She then texted and called me non-stop for about 2 hours. The texts were awful and mean, full of cussing and name calling and making it seem like I was in the wrong. She called me literally 36 times in a row. I kept texting her to please leave me alone, I will reach out when I'm ready. I told her she was scaring me. She didn't stop.

We've been on a knife's edge ever since this incident. Currently she's acting very kind because I told her next time she did something like that I'd leave her. However, she's made minimizing comments about the boundaries I've set too, like ""Oh, well I guess I can't say that anymore.""

Anyway, I hope any of this makes sense. I didn't realize until now how poorly I'm able to communicate these things. I feel lost. If anyone has been in a similar situation, how did you handle it? Does this actually sound abusive to you? She's not like this all the time. I don‚Äôt know what to do next, and I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice.",2025-02-27 20:58:44,2025-03-17 03:28:50,help

I feel like I'm in a nightmare. I hate him, I have no idea how I fell in love with such a cruel person. He seems so kind but he is emotionally a nightmare for me. 

I havent felt this ugly, worthless, and disgusting in years. And I was abused by someone else for 10 years. If he reqd this he would think that means ""you must've been lying then because I'm not abusive so therefor your ex wasn't.""

I cannot stand him. He makes me feel like the only way to be heard is by never speaking. The amount of times I have gone to bed crying because of him or contemplating suicide is sick. He would think this is because I'm just always crying and always suicidal. 

If I tell him my emotions he immediately tells me he can't tell me his. 

He defelcts EVERY single word I say. I am not exaggerating. If you combed through any text I've sent him about my emotions, he hasn't once responded directly. He will just talk about his. 

He truly has convinced me I am the problem, that is the only reason I kept staying. I have a history of forgiving people because I blow up, and I am so embarrassed of my reaction to their abuse, that I think I am insane and seek forgiveness. 

He tells me he can't say how he feels even though all he ever does is tell me how I don't do enough, make excuses, etc. I am disabled and have severe panic issues and I'm going through hell with what's happening in the US right now, and I am the only one making plans to leave or be safe, ones that he didn't even care for until I had to basically force him to care about my life and his. Im still working and going to college which is huge for me, especially in a time like this, and he says things like ""you wanted to quit school and work out of fear. You want to live in fear, I don't."" 

He makes me feel like a child, like he's a stern hard working father who looks down on his daughter for being weak. My disabilities had to be proven to him, even while he knows they're real he still thinks I'm making excuses. He judges me so harshly with his eyes and silence, I feel like I need to appease him for him to see me as equal. 

I blocked him today but he tried contacting me because he had a shitty conversation with his dad, I comforted and defended him as I always do even though he probably thinks I'm a bitch for getting angry at his dad. If he heard that hed say ""you're putting words in my mouth"" even though that's how he sees me. Angry, rude, etc. He's never stood up for me when I tell him about my family, he thinks I'm negative, exaggerating, and mean about everyone and everything 

I've been told the opposite by anyone who has genuinely known me. Even my ex who was very abusive thought I was the kindest most empathetic person he'd met, he told me I was the reason he learned to feel color and empathy. he abused me in other ways but God even he made me feel like I was appreciated more than this. This guy thinks any negative emotion is like Satan and that youre ungrateful and weird for feeling anything. He sees my passion and strong emotions for things in the world as me being angry, he sees me talking about the abuse I've endured as negativity and shitting on other people. I could literally spend weeks trying to figure things out for him to make sure he's safe and he still tells me ""I want to be with someone who does things mutually and cares about me. Someone kind and gentle.""

I am kind and gentle. He is bringing out the worst in me. I have never gotten this angry at anyone other than my narcissist brother and my dad. Genuinely he makes me want to hurt myself. He gets me to the point of screaming. He says I'm screaming even when I'm not, and then when I do that's his ticket to tell me I'm not what he wants. He would also think this is my fault, that I get to this point. I have severe PTSD and he pushes all of the buttons, what feels like on purpose. If he heard that, he would say that's just my trauma, not him. I feel like I am literally losing my mind. 

We got off the phone now because I told him I couldn't take this anymore as I always do. Because after 5 minutes of me explaining how he doesn't appreciate or see me and that it's unfair that he thinks I'm doing nothing, all he did was say the same thing he always says. ""I don't agree with what you just told me. And am I not allowed to feel how I feel? That's what you're telling me?"" And to me saying I couldn't do this anymore, he just said ""I don't want to be with you. We can be friends"" I broke down, I was already leaving. Every time I tell him I CANT DO THIS ANYMORE, HE then tells me ""I don't wanna be with you."" I screamed I can't take this anymore, I CANT I CANT JUST STOP I CANT. and I hung up, he was still talking the whole time I was saying that. I'm shaking. 

He sent me a text saying ""I think we should see other people. I want to be with someone kind and who wants to do things with me mutually like partners. But we can still be friends I'm here for you (:"" or something like that, I deleted it and he's blocked. 

I need to make sure he never has access to me and my heart again. I am already going through hell right now. I am already terrified for my life and everyone else's and I'm the only one who seems to care and he yet again just convinced me I'm the one not being a partner and that he's gonna see other people. I hate him. He makes me hate myself so much. Every time I really need him it's like he uses it as an opportunity to crush me and make me feel even more alone. How do I make sure I stop letting this happen? I am so bad at having boundaries, and I'm so alone in my life I'm stupid and take the bait whenever he gently comes back and says something nice. 

I'm going to have an aneurysm if I keep letting him speak to me. I need this to end. ",2025-03-11 03:44:13,2025-03-17 03:28:55,help

He doesn't want to learn how to drive because he wants to have a chofer .. he always give me a HORRIBLE hard time if I want to do anything with him like just going out with him is a hustle that ended up in a fight. And I start having friends so if he doesn't want to hang out then I will try and hang out with my friends. For him to hang out means ""you can be at my room and we can watch a movie"" and I hate his room because is covered is food containers, weed cartridge and vape cartridge everywhere, his bed is dirty and everything is cover in dust. I just don't want to be in his room and watch a movie as a plan for the day. Like for god sake why is so hard to go out and eat an ice cream or have any other activity's without making threats or insults everybody? is just very upsetting because he always gave me shit about not wanting to spend time with him. I don't want to spend time with him because he is always sleeping/high or whatever so if he is not responding to my texts about ""hey let's hang out!"" at 2:30PM then I will ask to my friends if they want to hang out with me. And of course once is 8PM this dude decided to wake up and give me shit about ""why you don't want to spend time with me? Well duh I asked you and you are always sleeping... anyway yesterday I decided to ask if he want to watch a movie with me, this movie is VERY VERY SPECIAL and of course he wants everything to be on his way. I said to him that we can go to the theater that is in another mall and I don't care to drive just 10min more because I just want to watch the movie! I said to him that the other day when I went with my friend to that mall he never complained and in fact we have a lot of fun! so after I mentioned my friend he decided to throw all this messages to me. What should I do? I am in the wrong? I am the asshole here?
I forgot to add that the part that he is mentioning about moving, here is the truth. I live with my mother now since she went thru a divorce and she needs me, I am very close to my mom and she take care of me and I take care of her. She is tired of living in this depressing state so she wants to move to another state closer to our country (Spain) I support that. We want to move to Georgia and of course I have to say to him ""I am planning to move to Georgia"" so his answer was ""you are moving with your fucking mom and you are leaving me here? I can't smoke weed in a Georgia stay here and abandon your mom find a studio here and live there, if I move with you as soon I save money you and I are away from your mom"" of course I decided to just say yes a everything so I avoid a fight.

1j7sr9v,feeling lost and need help,pink-banana-boat,2,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j7sr9v/feeling_lost_and_need_help/,"I have been struggling in my marriage for years.  I think I know the next steps that I need to take, but I am scared to take them.  I don't know what to do next.  I am sorry, this is going to be really long.  I haven't really opened up about my situation to anyone, at least not the whole story.

My husband (46) and I (40) met in college when I was 22.  We dated and only a few months later I ended up pregnant with our first child.  If my current self could have talked to myself back then about waiting longer. (hindsight, right?).  When I was pregnant with our second I was invited to a birthday party for a good friend of mine (who happened to be a dude, and no, I was never interested in him as more than a friend, I firmly believe that opposite sexes can be platonic friends with each other), and my partner (we weren't married yet) forbid me from going to the birthday party to see a lot of my college friends.  When I insisted I was going to go anyway, because it is a free country and I will see my friends if I want to, he blocked the doorway so I couldn't leave.  When I tried to push past him, he hit me.  I hit him back and then he hit me again.  I should have walked away then.  But I didn't.  To this day, he insists that I am the one who raised my hand first.  It makes me feel crazy like I don't remember what actually happened that day.  

Over the years, my sexual libido has declined.  Things went from (pre-first baby) having sex at least once a day to (after first baby) a several times a week to (after second baby) twice a week.  None of this was every enough for him and he would complain and tell me that I was ignoring his needs and not doing enough.  We would set ""schedules"" that he agreed to, but I couldn't honestly hold to because it was just too much for me, so I was constantly not upholding my end of the bargain.  When I would try to point out that the frequency was too much, then I was told that I wasn't being considerate enough of his needs.  Fast forward - he graduated and we moved cross country.  I went through a big hormonal change and my libido completely disappeared, but I still tried to maintain once a week or once every other week in order to satisfy him.  At one point, he just decided to stop kissing me.  Up until that point, we would kiss romantically every day, before he left for work or when he would get home (or both).  He decided that since that daily kissing was not leading to daily sex that it was unnecessary and we weren't going to do that anymore.  If he couldn't get what he wanted, then I was not going to get what I wanted.  Our sexual/intimate/romantic relationship died from there on out.  Because we had young kids at home, it was very difficult for me to hold a job during the normal work week due to the high costs of childcare.  So I eventually started my own business and ran it completely online (NOT AN MLM).  

A year later, I quit my part-time retail job to focus on my business as it was proving to be quite successful.  Two years later I gave birth to my third child.  During all this time, I was consistently told that I didn't do enough for my husband romantically or sexually, I didn't keep our house clean enough, and the list went on.  When my work grew to be too overwhelming to accomplish what I needed to do ""during the workday"" I began to continue working on it during the evening and early night hours.  Mind you, I had young children and an infant home with me during the day, so I did NOT have a ton of ""free time"" as I was taking care of their needs.  My husband began to berate me for all the time that I put into my business that wasn't ""really a business"".  

One time.  We had friends coming to visit and after I had spent 24 hours cleaning our house from top to bottom, all I had left to do was clean up and organize my work desk.  He was in a mood and he threw everything off my work desk onto the floor - including my desktop computer.  I was in tears.  He trashed the living room and told me everything was my fault because I cared more about my business than about him, our family, or making things presentable for our guests.   I threw myself into my business even more to show him that I was doing something good for all of us.  I even took on help and was able to make the income I needed to justify paying for childcare out of my business paycheck to myself.  It was never good enough.

  
We moved again and shortly after the pandemic happened.  I went through a couple of years with a lot of health problems.  During this time, my husband had a complaint about one of our children and I stood up to him.  It resulted in my husband smashing all of my house plants on the floor of our kitchen and dining room.  Our kids witnessed the whole thing.  He felt bad and replaced the pots and some of the plants and had a long talk with the kids about how you can't behave the way they just saw.  He has not damaged anything since that day, but instead, when he is angry, he will follow me from room to room when I try to make space from him to avoid a blow up fight that could turn physical.  He will wake me up out of a dead sleep to tell me all the things I am not doing good enough.  

A couple of years ago, I took my kids back home to visit with family.  It was a nice long visit and I came back to my home refreshed and rejuvenated and ready to work on the cracks in my marriage.  We had very nice sex and things seemed to be going good.  Then one day shortly after, he explodes in anger because I used the credit card to put gas and food on it during the travel back home (I drove 2400 miles away).  I was then accused of using sex as a weapon.

I have honestly just reached a point where I am stressed out when he is home.  I am always on edge because I never know if it will be a good day or a bad day.  We haven't had sex in almost a year, in 2 years we have only had sex two times.  I cannot get to that point sexually with him.  I feel vulnerable and exposed.  With the lack of trust, I just can't keep doing it.  It used to be one week a month I was told how I didn't do enough, I wasn't intimate enough, I wasn't present enough, I didn't make enough money, etc, etc.

I slowed my business way down in order to have more time to spend with my family.  I have struggled picking up part-time jobs because not a single one is flexible with my kids' school schedules.  They all want you to work until 4pm or start at 4pm, which would leave my youngest kids home alone for 1-2 hours.  I just can't do it, and can't find childcare for such a short time on randomly scheduled days.  

My husband and I talked about the financial part and we agreed it would be good for me to go back to school and finish my degree.  So I did.  I will finally graduate this May.  The last two years have been the literal worst two years of my married life so far.  The berating for not being present enough, being told constantly that I am selfish for not spending more time with my kids or him.  The list goes on.  

Well, over the holidays, he was upset about how much money I spent between Halloween/Thanksgiving/Christmas, so he took away all the bankcards, credit card and debit card.  He accused me of running the credit card up (this balance was added to mutually).  When I tried to ask for a print out of all the transactions, he refused to print it out.  Told me that I didn't need to see it and neither did he.  So there was no way for me to confirm if/by how much I may have overspent.  I am not super financially savvy, but I am not a big-spender either.  I do my best to spend within my means and pay debt down.  He left me completely without access to money so I have been unable to pay my son's dental bill one day or my own medical copays for doctor visits. Or even put gas in the vehicles.

Thanks to contributions from my family, I went to visit my sister over the holidays and had a wonderful time.  When I came home, I had decided that I wanted to go for grad school and get a masters degree.  One of my professor's in my class this semester invited me to do an independent study project, it would be really helpful for me to show what I am capable of.  When I talked to my husband about these ideas and about my future goals - he was shocked.  Shocked in anger that is.  I was told that I was wasting his time, my kids time, and my parents time by pursuing those things.  That I am way too old to be starting any of that now and I need to just get a job and start making money and getting ready to retire.  That whomever I have been talking to about these ideas is giving me bad information and I shouldn't take anything they say seriously.  That I would be a fool to go down this path because it will take too long and I will ruin my children's lives while they are still home.  I have spent the last 18 years of my life supporting him, his education (early on), and all of his career goals/decisions, and this is what happens when I try to stretch my own wings to fly?

I want to divorce.  But my daughter is going to start her last year of high school this fall, and I just can't bring myself to go through a divorce and potentially ruin what she has been calling her ""golden year"" for the last few months.  She has all these big ideas and dreams of what she wants to do and accomplish her senior year.  If I divorce my husband now, I would move closer to family, which would pull her out of her school and away from her friends.  Or I would leave her here and not get to share her senior year with her.  Neither is acceptable to me.  Am I making the right choice here?  Or am I just over reacting?  Are all husbands this way?  Is he actually being abusive in some way or am I just exaggerating it in my own head?  What do I do from here?",2025-03-10 06:55:09,2025-03-17 03:28:59,help

However, I think my ex with whom i stayed with for a year was a perfect man when viewed from the society's perspective.

He was however, an abusive alcoholic man. He had a big ego and anger issues. He was also cheating in ways I don't want to elaborate on. It was an extreme level of verbal and emotional abuse.

I am not a greedy person and his money was not the reason why I chose him or why i tolerated abuse.
He provided me with a really comfortable life (no emotional and mental comfort tho) and there was never a financial problem. I am a working woman too and can pay my own bills.
He however took it on himself to pay for all my expenses.

It confuses me a lot. A person who is doing so much for me but is also abusive. 
I loved him from the bottom of my heart and that is the only reason why i stayed. I tried my best to fix him but failed.
I left him a while ago because I could no longer tolerate the abuse. It was affecting my self-esteem and mental health and my trust on him was fu,ked.

Was i ungrateful that i chose to leave ? 
Was I expecting too much ?
Sometimes i feel guilty that i left a man who did so much for me.

A lot of women joke about how they would rather cry in a lambo than on a bus. However, for me both are equally just as bad.

Would you have left too if you were in my place ?

Despite this, I still am deeply in love with him, deeply connected to him, and share so many interests together (for example, we both love cats, the outdoors, have similar political views, share many of the same perspectives on very specific and obscure topics). We both have chronic health problems and can understand each other on a deep level, and he‚Äôs the first partner I‚Äôve ever had who has accepted me and never left/abandoned despite my chronic pain and health issues. When things are good, they are REALLY good: he‚Äôs my best friend, he knows what I‚Äôm thinking, he ‚Äúgets‚Äù me, lifts me up and supports me, encourages me, believes in me, motivates me, and we have laughed SO much and had such incredible times together‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶Yet when things are bad, they can also be REALLY bad‚Ä¶he has called me every name in the book, cussed at me, screamed at me, thrown things around me, threatened to dump dozens of times, given me the silent treatment, threatened to abandon me in unfamiliar places, demanded my attention constantly (getting mad if I don‚Äôt answer right away), and acted somewhat controlling in various ways. The abuse episodes, while not physical, could be pretty horrific at times and would leave me numb/dissociated or in tears (often I didn‚Äôt cry, because he would get angry at me for crying around him after having his verbal abuse episodes).

He learned these behaviors from his parents and has been in denial about it for our whole relationship, despite me begging him throughout the years to stop and to get help. During the last episode, he was throwing things around and yelling, and I felt genuinely scared. He has extreme anger/rage issues and takes them out on me sometimes which can be quite upsetting and frightening. It led to my cortisol levels going through the roof, having a nervous breakdown for weeks, needing to take a separation from him to seek mental health treatment (therapy 2-3x/week), and I almost dropped out of my graduate program.

We have been on a hiatus for the past ~2 months and have talked about breaking up. I told him I needed a break after having a nervous breakdown, and we broke up for a short period but then started talking again. He said he would do anything to not lose me, that I‚Äôm the love of his life, and promised he would do everything I asked to change‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm upset he didn‚Äôt do this years before. After he proposed to me almost 2 years ago, I told him (as I had multiple times before) that he had to work on his mental health, and and we already postponed marriage almost 1 year. He only recently (when we took a break from the relationship) started getting therapy and meditating. He seems to be working on himself and like he ‚Äúfinally‚Äù wants to improve and change (he said being on the verge of losing me was his ‚Äúwake-up call to action‚Äù), but it‚Äôs hard for me to fully believe it after all these years of emotional abuse. 

We are now basically in a state of limbo. I have no idea what to do. Everyone says I should leave him and maybe that‚Äôs true but I still can‚Äôt help but feel like he‚Äôs my soulmate.  I miss him so much and constantly want to talk to him. Whenever I see a funny meme or cat video, an interesting article, think of something strange he would chuckle at or appreciate, I want nothing more than to call him or text him. I love him so much and I wish our love didn‚Äôt have to be complicated by his abuse and mental health problems. I feel so stuck, sad, heartbroken, lonely, and confused. I can‚Äôt help but wonder if leaving him and not sticking around to see if he gets better will be something I‚Äôll always regret, because I cannot imagine meeting someone I‚Äôll love more than him.üíî",2025-02-18 06:31:03,2025-03-17 03:29:02,help

She says I can do either EDMR or radical acceptance therapy. She says I need to come to terms with what happened (this is true). 

But I asked her ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it bad to stay with someone who abused you? I would never tell my friend to stay if she was in this position.‚Äù And then she said because the abuse was only 1 time, because he‚Äôs going to therapy twice a month, and BECAUSE he‚Äôs paying for my therapy and being supportive, that she feels confident that he truly made a mistake and I might be able to accept it. She says forgiveness isn‚Äôt for the other person, it‚Äôs for me. I am willing to try the radical acceptance therapy for my PTSD. 

But I‚Äôm just so confused. I am lonely sure but I was pretty proud of how I am slowly breaking that trauma bond. And now she‚Äôs saying it would be okay to stay with him.

Were at the impasse, I'm willing to give her one chance to do something different, because we're married and I do care about her, but she needs to take accountability for her actions. I realize this is unlikely, but still I want to try once. It means taking accountability, actively seeking individual therapy (i was already doing this because i find value in therapy, but she scared my therapist away), and actively seeking couples therapy.

A little background, she is/was my friend of 15 years, friend only, pen pal so to speak. We had eventually agreed that we were platonic after she gave up on multiple past attempts to meet. A few years ago, she changed her mind and wanted to try. Prior to all this I had been going through a massive depressive and suicidal place in my life - i was coping with it using promiscuity. This all happened before we were together in any way.

I want to make clear, I'm aware I probably should have left far earlier but something stopped me from doing so early on.

Fast forward, she finally accomplishes traveling here and we meet. The second day she's here, she goes through my phone and makes all these wild assumptions, to which I just told her honestly that I was very promiscuous when I was going through some major depression and suicidal events in my life, and added that she saved my life and gave me hope.

She raged and destroyed the gifts I bought her and told me I didn't love her.

We worked through this and talked a lot and eventually got married. But it was only after we moved that the significant abuse started.

***I want to make clear to anyone who has been abused, our past choices and mistakes are not an excuse to abuse someone as a means to express their feelings***

July 2023, my wife starts a verbal argument about ""[the whores before her]"" and other stuff, I'm in my boxers and she punches me and then strangles me next to the kitchen, I retreat to the living room, she collapses the folding chair and hits me with it, proceeds to hit me with a barrage of punches one which I parry and gently roll her away from me, I retreat to the bedroom to get dressed so I can leave the house and let her cool down, when I'm getting my pants, she appears in the room with my keys in one hand and a kitchen knife (large for meat and veggies) in the other, approaches me about 1 foot away, and threatened to kill me and then herself. I'm sobbing and I truly believe I'm going to die in this moment. She continues her raging, grabs the pants from me and we struggled for them. She screams ""you bought these jeans with those whores"" and begins to slice the pants up. She then walks out of the room, returned the knife to the kitchen drawer (I know it was the drawer knife because one is kept in the drawer and the other kitchen knife sits in the wooden knife set holder). She returns to the room, sits on the bed in a meditation position and begins meditating like nothing happened. She claims she was looking for the scissors because she was angry at the pants but grabbed the knife because she couldnt find the scissors, but she didn't even see the pants until she was in the room when I was trying to put them on - the scissors are always in the knife stand. I texted 911, they came and arrested her, officers could see i was visibly shaking and in shock. They reported that my wife was uncooperative during the arrest in the police report.

My wife was just a new arrival to the US, so she had literally fucked her possibility of immigration, but because I love her I called off work, called my lawyer friends, and worked all night and day to get her out of jail -- I was new to this state and didn't know the domestic abuse laws required the perp to be arrested no matter what and that the police must press charges. Got her out and she was grateful, however one of the first comments she made on the drive home was ""they (the prisoners and guard) don't believe I did that because you're bigger"".

Court orders her non-violent contact and to get a psychiatric evaluation. She failed the violent contact the first day by picking fights about ""whores"" and screaming in the car and at home. She refused to go to the psychiatric evaluations, but changed her mind when I explained that if she doesn't comply, the judge could have her put back in jail.

Everything that follows is after the knife event. 

This would continue for, almost now, two years. Often it starts with her bringing up ""the whores.""

On some occasions violently attacking me while in trying to drive on highways sometimes over speeds of 70mph.

One time, I asked if I could have a few drinks with my buddy, asked if she could drive home, and she said okay to driving home. When we headed home, she drove wrecklessly and violently while screaming about ""whores"", all the while knowing I have severe passenger anxiety I do fine with most people. I refuse to be here passenger since then.

She has destroyed my property and claimed it was ""a gift from whores"" - it was a gift from a colleague at my first big job. She has destroyed other property at home. 

She kicked my car after a nice trip to a city I had a customer at, I didn't even need to being her. It started with her suddenly bringing up a specific ex-girlfriend (which has no significance in my life) then going on about whores, another incident where she assaulted me while I was in the highway. She kicked my car door when we arrived home.

On a few occasions at our apartment, she has screamed ""I will kill myself"" when I went to leave the apartment to de-escalate what I knew would turn into a fight. I took a drive to get some coffee to calm down and she called me and said ""I will kill myself and you don't care or love me,"" then I called the police with this first incident to do a wellness check, I couldn't stay there. The second event, I just went for a walk and she calmed down, knowing she was bluffing.

I tried to help her with her unemployment. Her boss was a former friend of mine. She quit on circumstances of discrimination. I helped her at an appeal hearing but there want enough. When we got home, she said ""I got scared and wanted to be friends with my old friend again"" (no, I was disgusted my former friend abused her position and failed to protect my wife), then called me a bitch and pussy. I was simply trying to help her with her unemployment and still have tried after that.

She has thrown objects and water on me at home.

She belittles me saying the car I bought her so she could be independent and have a job (brand new) ""wasn't a BMW"". 

She threw her friend under the bus, gaslighting her friend into believing I was the abuser. I told her you leave after this, he friend came by (disillusioned by my wifes lies) helped her take all her stuff. My wife after a day or two ""missed me"" and wanted to see me. So we did, we tried a fresh start. After a few days longer, she told her friend she  wanted to go home. Her friend was pissed, and describe me wife's actions as ""having shit on her"" after all she has done for her.

The most recent abuse was her starting an argument when she was at training, her claiming I ""would start shit"" at her graduation. I ended that call and told her I was my coming. Another act of her abuse, this time passive aggressive using false assumptions and projection.

Since then we haven't talked.

There are other small things, like she was allegedly abused by her ex-husband, but when she called him for something related to selling a house, he sounded aggrieved and his words were those of someone who had been cheated on and had been betrayed. I can only speculate on this but, it doesn't match her description of events. And then there is her denial of all the past relationships she used to always contact me about and ask me for advice about.

Am I crazy? Am I being abused? I surely know I am, but I feel so fucking hopeless right now.

I want to help her get help, but my instinct says ""run the fuck away and disappear"".

Please help.

Thank you for your time.

My (f40s) partner (M40s) said I should go ahead and call AmEx tonight so I did.  This is where it gets weird, he sat next to me on the couch and he asked ‚Äúwho gave you the idea to call AmEx?‚Äù I replied that I did and that I took his suggestion to go ahead and call them.  He just STARED at me while I was looking straight ahead at the tv.  I have no idea why this bothered him (I didn‚Äôt give enough credit to him?? For what I don‚Äôt know).  Anyways, I put my credit card in my purse in the other room and he told me not to leave in the middle of an argument (I didn‚Äôt know we were in one) and I should have just brought the purse to the room (no clue why that way was better).  Fast forward a few minutes and he came behind me saying mean things and had just started recording since I had a feeling he was in this mood‚Ä¶.  And that was when he attacked me and tried to grab the phone out of my hands and grabbed my hoodie on my sweatshirt and pulled it so hard the hood ripped off and half the shirt is ripped down the front.  He pulled my hair and was super aggressive.  At some point when he was grabbing me, his left arm went in front of my mouth so I bit it to get him to loosen up his grip.  He got my phone and refused to give it back to me.  I grabbed my purse, my dog, and my work laptop and got out of the house after begging and pleading for him to give me my phone back - about 20ish minutes.  (He also accused me of stealing his phone bc he lost it, I didn‚Äôt)

I left and sat in a parking lot and I took a couple calls and tried to tell him I wasn‚Äôt coming back.  He told me I was cheating on him since I wouldn‚Äôt tell him exactly where I was.  So I FaceTimed him and showed him it was just me and the dog.  After we hung up, I drove to another parking lot.  I tried ignore his texts and calls until I couldn‚Äôt but after 20 min of texts and more accusations of cheating I just gave up and shut my eyes.  I heard the phone ring a few times but didn‚Äôt answer,  eventually checked my texts and I saw a video of him throwing away my 5 pairs of Loubitins (btw, I don‚Äôt make crazy money but these have been purchased as rewards to myself over the last 7 years).  

I finally decided to go back, hoping he was asleep and to find my shoes and pack to get out of there for a week.  

He was not asleep and he gaslit me on the shoes (he sent me a video of him throwing them away which is why I showed up and trash day is tomorrow)‚Ä¶found out my personal laptop was also missing.  He accused me of losing it but I stuck it on the desk when I unpacked earlier today.  He kept calling me crazy and for me to take my meds (I am not crazy and I am not on any meds).  So after 20-30 min of looking, even bringing back the trash can from the street and emptying it looking for the shoes (one empty box was on top) the shouting ensued and then he gaslit me again‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúYou ripped your own shirt‚Äù ‚Äúyou took the hoodie off‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs how they are work now‚Äù ‚Äúwell the under shirt isn‚Äôt ripped so how could I have done that‚Äù

I told him to get my my laptop or I‚Äôd call the cops and he said he would and then he did‚Ä¶. He put the phone in my face when they answered, I assumed he would hang up, but when he didn‚Äôt I finally said ‚Äúhe attacked me‚Äù and then I left the room when I heard him say a lie and so they were sending someone out.  

I panicked and started packing again, got 2 small bags in the car and then they showed up.  

I didn‚Äôt know what to say or do to them.  I freaked out - I didn‚Äôt want them to arrest him (I‚Äôm too nice) and I didn‚Äôt want someone to arrest me for my self defense to get him off me and stop him from strangling me more with the shirt with the bite.  (There IS a nasty red line around my neck and it burns) I also don‚Äôt want them to think I‚Äôm crazy and need meds - bc I don‚Äôt.  Or that I‚Äôm the abuser.  

I heard one cop talking to him and the cop said ‚Äúwell that will do it‚Äù to something he said so who knows what lie (or lies) was told.  He can be very charming.

I don‚Äôt know what to do - the cops want me to go to police station tomorrow evening for a full statement.  I don‚Äôt want to get arrested.  I don‚Äôt want him to get arrested.  Any help or advice what they might do if I give a detailed statement but don‚Äôt take action?  Will they decide to open it up anyways?  

The cops took photos of my neck and shirt and gave me a couple pages on victims to look at.  (They also let me go grab some clothes)

TL:DR - I was physically attacked on the couch and I bit his arm when they were wrapped around me and strangling me with my shirt.  I left for a few hours, went back when i found out he threw expensive shoes out.  He kept at it when he wouldn‚Äôt tell me where some of my stuff is, threatened to call the cops but he did it instead.  I don‚Äôt know what to do?  I don‚Äôt want to get arrested - or him.  I want to be believed.  What happens after you give your statement?  (They also gave me a couple printouts on victim help)

(Edit to add; this morning I went to grab something from my car, my personal laptop was in the back, I don‚Äôt remember putting it there bc I would have put it with my work laptop in my front.  I‚Äôm not sure if he put it there when I wasn‚Äôt looking or if for some reason I was so scared and heightened that I don‚Äôt remember putting it there (but again, it doesn‚Äôt make sense for me to put it caddy corner on its side like I found it)",2025-02-10 09:17:06,2025-03-17 03:29:18,help

Obviously throw away account. I need advice and help. So I am to be married in 3 weeks to my partner of almost 9 years. Our relationship has been everything; beautiful and hard and challenging and rewarding and anguish and triumph. But the last two years have been absolute hell. We bought a house together and have pets, no kids, and getting engaged and married was the next, expected thing. 
The problem is my fianc√© is‚Ä¶.well it‚Äôs not good. I‚Äôm strong, and I‚Äôll be okay, but he‚Äôs emotionally and physically abusive and it‚Äôs been getting worse and worse. His drinking is out of control and he has been having trouble holding a job. I have been paying our mortgage and all our bills for almost a year. 

Why you ask are we getting married if this is the case? Because I am an idiot, and I love him, and I let his family convince me into having the wedding. I thought things would get better. Here we are 3 weeks out and everything is bad. I cannot marry this man. I need advice on legally how I can get out of this marriage without embarrassment. Can I fake go through the wedding without legally filing and without getting in trouble? His uncle is the officiant and I don‚Äôt want him in any trouble either. We‚Äôre in Texas.

1j1kx0r,Am I an Abusive Partner? (PLEASE HELP. I NEED ADVICE.),panda_lord696969,2,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j1kx0r/am_i_an_abusive_partner_please_help_i_need_advice/,"I need genuine advice about this because I can't tell if I'm in the wrong or not. Me (F19) and my partner (F22) are currently in a BIG fight over something we've fought about before.

So for a little background, I have ADHD and struggle with emotional regulation/sensory issues, which doesn't excuse any negative behaviors but I feel like it's still important.

My girlfriend has grabbed me and held me down MULTIPLE times because she because she believed I was a ""danger"" to myself even though I've told her multiple times that I hate being restricted in that way and I can't tolderate it. I have memories of her laying on top of me and grabbing my arms very tightly and me yelling for her to get off but she wouldn't. This memory followed with me first trying to physically pushing her off, but then when that didn't work I started hitting at her. This was after multiple times of me telling her to get off of me. Due to this, I accidentally gave her a very faded black eye. I felt awful about it obviously, but she blamed me and told me that not matter what happens I should NEVER hit her or lay my hands on her that way.

That wasn't the first time either -- it has happened plenty of times where I clearly tell her ""stop"" and ""get off"" and when I can't take it anymore I get physical with her just to get her off of me. She has called me abusive for this. She also told me that she would never hit me the way that I hit her. I feel very conflicted with myself, because of COURSE I take no pleasure in hurting her.. but isn't it at least a little bit justifyable if I have told her MULTIPLE TIMES to please not touch me / get off of me? I get overtstimulated incredible easy, and I get scared too. I'm a nervous train wreck. 

Our most recent fight was over her yelling at me, me getting upset, and trying to scoot away from her because I did not want to be touched. She took that as an opportunity to ""act"" offended and then press her hands and body against me (in her words), a ""playful"" manner. Of course, that did not feel like that AT ALL to me. It felt like my skin was being ripped apart but I tried my best to tell her to ""stop"" without sounding too angry. So I had told her verbally to stop, and yet she did not stop. It all felt like too much and I was overwhelmed from being yelled at and now the disrespectful touching so without thinking I kicked her legs away from me. Right after this, she starting yelling at me saying stuff like ""what is wrong with you?!"" and she threw a pillow hard to my face storming off. 

She then starting texting me about how I shouldn't be ""hitting people"" and that she won't tolerate me putting my hands on her any longer. I told her that it's just like before, and I give her multiple chances to respect my boundaries when I'm incredibly overwhelmed but she doesn't listen to me. What else am I supposed to do? If she won't listen to be verbally, the only thing I can do is retaliate physically. I would never PURPOSEFULLY hurt my girlfriend with the intention of hurting her. The only thing I want to do is get her to stop touching me when I tell her no. I don't hit her out of anger- I do it out of fear and overstimulation. The second she's not touching me anymore all I do is lay in a corner and try my best to calm down.

She's told me in her text that she's breaking up with me if I think it's okay to hit her. OBVIOUSLY I don't think it's okay to hit her, but she makes it about herself everytime I feel like my boundaries are being crossed. Am I actually an abusive partner? Am I being gaslit? I don't know what's happening anymore.. I'm tired about fighting over this again and again. She believes that me hitting her is worse than her crossing my boundaries (physically). ""Crossing your boundaries is one thing, and hitting me is another."" I'm terrified of the idea that I'm abusive, but I'm willing to change if that's the case. I don't want to be a bad person.

Please help me because I'm shaking and freaking out I just don't know what to do anymore. I love her so much and I don't want her to leave me. I feel like she doesn't respect me, but at the same time maybe I'm genuinely an abusive individual who can't see that they're wrong. I want to be better. Please tell me if I'm in the wrong.",2025-03-02 06:52:23,2025-03-17 03:29:21,help

1iegqan,"What did people say (or act), that helped you leave?",tahynnuf,12,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iegqan/what_did_people_say_or_act_that_helped_you_leave/,"TL;DR: A loved one is in an abusive relationship. It's incredibly hard to watch. If you left your abuser, did anyone say or do anything in particular, that helped you towards making that choice? 

  
Longer version:

  
I know that this channel is full of people saying 'help me help them leave', and I know that the general answer is 'you can't, just be there for them' - but that's so hard to accept. I was hoping that someone had had an epiphany once, because a loved one said something, that made you more likely to leave. Then I can steal that and use it.

  
A loved one is in a very abusive relationship and she has really only just realised it (sort of) now. It's serious. CPS is involved, threatening to remove the baby. Her family, the abuser's family, the council, her therapist, the crisis centre for victims of domestic abuse, the baby's nursery, all of her friends - all say the same thing: GET OUT. HE IS DANGEROUS. But she has been so brainwashed. It's so scary, so incredibly scary.

  
She just left, after he got physical with her again. She says it's the second time he violently shoved her (and the baby), but she also keeps saying ""I've not even told you the worst stuff"", so I feel like there's much more. He has ruined her self-esteem. I read his messages and it's the most intense example of gaslighting I have ever seen (and I've been in abusive relationships too). Every single one of her thoughts and feelings are immediately invalidated. One of the reasons she says she won't leave is because ""what if she's making it all up"" and ""she's always overreacting anyways"".

  
She finally got away from him. And has stayed with me for three days. She was so close. She even decided to never return. We were almost there. Then he called her. Begged and cried. Told her she was ruining his life. She now ""owes it to him to return and give it a shot"" and ""give him a second chance"". Even though CPS seriously warned her against going back to him.

  
I feel like I've tried everything. But I'm also autistic, so I'm not good at the feelings bit. I just keep telling her factual things about abuse, showing her graphs and shouting that she needs to leave and she's in danger. I know it's probably not helping one bit. I might even be making it worse. But I feel like I am sending her back to be murdered. I can't physically keep her away from him and this situation.

  
I know I have to accept that it's out of my hands. 

  
So I was hoping someone had any ideas about what to say. What to do. I have a hard time accepting that there isn't a 'magic switch' that would make her realise that she needs to stay away. Anything I say, she says, ""You're overreacting"". Trust me, I am not. 

  
Thank you if you've read all that. I hope that by writing this here, I can keep myself from just... screaming at her that I don't want her to die. ",2025-01-31 15:03:06,2025-03-17 03:29:28,help

The more I work, the angrier he'll get because things around the house will not be getting done, in the way he wants. I honestly fear for my safety, when I have to come home.

I reached out to a shelter that helps women, but she said they're at their full and can't help me. She asked me a bunch of questions before and then denied me. I personally felt I wasn't as important or the situation wasn't as bad, in her eyes. I'm going to call more places and see if someone could help me. I believe me becoming silent and not talking to him that much, could've caused him to spiral, in a way. I was protecting my energy. He literally tells me to shut up, while im talking. Also, when im talking, he just interrupts me without saying excuse me or sorry. Then, he'll just get up and leave me. Or he'll just completely ignore me. HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

I don't know how to navigate this safely.",2025-03-11 02:12:44,2025-03-17 03:29:31,help

1j8l2x4,Can couples therapy help?,Sufficient-Bit-3289,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j8l2x4/can_couples_therapy_help/,"I don't know what to do. My bf and I frequently get into arguments over the way he talks to me. I often feel belittled, criticized, and I'm always the butt of his jokes. It almost feels like he's trying to disguise his put downs as jokes. For example, he'll make a joke about me being fat, old, or otherwise unattractive and then insist that it's just a joke. I've lost track of how many times I've told him to tone it down (he will make multiple, sometimes cruel, ""jokes"" like this over and over in one sitting), and I've repeatedly told him that the frequency of these ""jokes"" makes it hard for me to pass them off as just jokes when it's relentless sometimes. Whenever I tell him that these ""jokes"" aren't funny and ask him to please just stop, he will say I'm ""too sensitive"" or that I have ""a stick up my butt"". He will say that this is just how he jokes, and that by me asking him to stop, I'm asking him to change as a person. Sometimes, he'll try to punish me by saying things like, ""OK, well then I just won't joke around with you at all anymore if you're going to get so offended at everything."" Or he'll talk in a flat, intentionally boring voice afterwards, or sometimes just not talk to me at all. 

I'm frequently left feeling confused, because other than this, I feel like he does love and care for me. But this whole thing has become beyond frustrating, because he isn't acknowledging how his behavior hurts me, and he isn't willing to stop even when I've repeatedly told him how much it bothers me. He just dismisses my feelings, and I know this is a big red flag. 

I feel like couples therapy might be our best chance at fixing this, but I get mixed signals from him on whether or not he's willing to try. He's told me that he doesn't want to do couples therapy because he doesn't trust that a therapist will actually try to help (because he thinks they have a financial incentive to keep us fighting/coming back). But he's also told me that this is the best relationship he's been in, and that he'll do whatever it takes to make it work. The real problem is, neither of us have the money for it right now.

I guess I'm just wondering if any of you have had an experience like this and if couples therapy (or anything else) has helped the situation or not.",2025-03-11 07:11:51,2025-03-17 03:29:34,help

(also have a couple other questions)",Careless-Internet171,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j9frvx/if_someone_with_abusive_tendencies_wants_to_get/,"My understanding is the majority of people say that someone who is abusive will likely not ever change, however I‚Äôve also seen many say that while a person is still in their early 20‚Äôs and growing that they do have a higher chance of being able to change for the better. This is assuming that the person really wants to change and understands that what they are doing is not okay. What are your thoughts on that?

Onto my main question. If abusive people really never change then what are they suppose to do? They get to continue to free roam the world as an abuser, and are they also not ever suppose to be able to get into a relationship? Obviously they shouldn‚Äôt subject others to their abusive ways, and nobody deserves to be put through that. But if they want to change and if we‚Äôre going with the belief that no abuser will ever be able to change then are they just suppose to be single and possibly sad/alone forever?

Side thought but why can‚Äôt some abusers care enough to change and not be abusive anymore? Not only for themselves but so they can happily be in a relationship too?

Another question, but is there a difference between a full blown abuser - like maybe someone who perhaps thinks abusive thoughts every day all the time, and someone who generally doesn‚Äôt think that way or have intentions to be abusive but then have small hiccups here and there when they are really upset and under pressure?

1g0p2pt,Help!! How did you realize you were in an abusive relationship?,Dangerous-Gift-5859,23,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1g0p2pt/help_how_did_you_realize_you_were_in_an_abusive/,"I'd like to hear from others experiences. Like many people when I think about abusive relationships I imagine a person who physically hurts someone, yells at them, humiliate them in public etc etc. But it's much harder to recognize abuse when it's not that overt. It doesn't help that I have low self-esteem that comes from childhood abuse.

I've been married for 18 years, two kids. He used to be sweet and kind in the beginning but over the years he has become increasingly self centered. Look, I try to be realistic about marriage, I have my shortcomings too and far from perfect and I know all marriages inevitably change with time. But I feel like I might be in denial and the thought of getting a divorce feels terrifying. But here are some personal examples:

- He used to apologize when he hurt my feelings. That hardly ever happens now. If I bring it up he usually gets defensive. When something goes wrong he acts like it was either me or the kids' fault.

 - When I had our babies both times I asked him to spend the night at the hospital with me but he said there was no bed for him there and he needed to rest. With our first child he even slept in and got a the hospital at noon the next day.

- I love talking about politics and social issues (I have a bachelors in Sociology). He's not that interested in those topics, which is fine, it's not for everyone. But when I start talking about it after a few minutes he'll act uninterested, sometimes straight up say it or even roll his eyes. Mind you, when he talks about his own interests I at least try to listen.

- Housework basically falls on me. We have a big house and it's overwhelming for me (I also work outside the house). The thing he basically does is to load and unload the dishwasher. When I complain about him not doing more around the house he gets defensive (again) and says I should relax about chores because I'm too picky about cleanliness. He'll then claim hes doing work equally since he's the one mowing the lawn and shoveling snow. But those are things that need to be done only during a few months a year, and the snow shoveling is basically done by our 14 year old now.

- At night when he and the kids go to bed I stay up to clean the kitchen. The next day he complains that I made too much noise cleaning the kitchen and interrupted his sleep. And if I say ""well someone has to clean it"", he again gets defensive and says ""I can do it in the morning (he works from home), but then he doesn't most of the time.

- He belittles my job and says I should get one that pays better. But he says it in a subtle way like ""you deserve better"", which is probably true, but I feel like he just wants me to make more money so he can quit his current job and become a college professor, which will basically pay 1/2 of what he makes now. Mind you, I've always been supportive of him becoming a professor. My current job is 25 hours a week but I feel like even if I get one thats 40 hours and make more money the house work thing will not change that much. He was unemployed a while ago for 4 months and would be on the couch all day, watching tv or or his phone. I'd get home from work and make dinner, do laundry and cleaning. 

- If we both have work meetings at the same time he expects me to figure out a way to pick up the kids at school.

- When I'm really really overwhelmed I might ask him to do the grocery shopping (I do it 99% of the time). He does it but makes a bug fuss. 

- a lot of times when I need to vent about something he'll find a way to make it about himself. I traveled to my home country during summer and when I came home I was really said and crying a lot because I missed my country and it was difficult ""transitioning"" back to my old routine. He seemed puzzled by my emotions and kinda annoyed, if you know what I mean. 

- When we go out as a family (when we can actually get him to want to go) a lot of times he'll become impatient and look bored. So for the past few years I just take the kids out myself, and tbh the mood feels ""lighter"". He has a hard time relaxing and being flexible. Everything has to be planned and timely, including vacations and outings. 

Sorry for the long post. But I feel I need to come to terms and find out if I really am in an abusive relationship, and if counseling can fix it or it its beyond salvation now. I appreciate any inputs from those who have been through similar situation. ",2024-10-10 18:05:24,2025-03-17 03:29:42,help

I (26F) am posting on behalf of my best friend (25F) in reference to a jarring experience I witnessed with her this past weekend. For ease of reading I‚Äôll call my best friend A & her boyfriend B (30-something M. I can never remember, he‚Äôs around 33/34 I think though) 

So A & B started dated a little under a year ago & they recently moved in together (Jan 2025) to the house that he owns. Since they started dating A has definitely become more distant but it was a new relationship so I wasn‚Äôt too worried about it because they just seemed happy & in love! Over the past year-ish I‚Äôve noticed a few times where she was extra distant and checked in on her. She‚Äôs let me know about some pretty intense fights stemming from insecurity from him, i.e. being upset with the fact that she‚Äôs dated people before him. Which is already incredibly immature but that really isn‚Äôt even the worst of it & really never made me super concerned. 

More recently she‚Äôs been using language pretty flippantly that has been making me grow more & more concerned but her & her safety in this relationship. For some context, I went through a pretty severe abusive relationship when I was 19 so I always have my ear out for signs & I may be more hyperaware than others & could be blurring the lines of normal relationship quarrels & abuse because I experienced it. 

Last week, she mentioned that she accidentally locked the door on her way out to an appointment while he was walking the dog (with no house key) and told me seemingly jokingly ‚Äúi‚Äôm scared about when I get home lol‚Äù and this is not the first time she‚Äôs used verbiage like that in reference to his behavior or reactions to things. This set off all of my alarm bells & I told my boyfriend that I am growing concerned & need to talk to her about it. On top of this, anytime we have had any girlfriend gatherings with our other friends or just her & I, she‚Äôs requested we do them at her house (with BF) because B is more comfortable with that. AGAIN, red flag but it‚Äôs a big house & we all live in apartments so no big deal but still strange. 

So here‚Äôs where things grew past concern/worry, to reality of at minimum mental/emotional abuse. On Saturday, she told me that she didn‚Äôt have any plans because B was busy all day doing various things with his friends. So we made plans to hang out at a bar with a cool DJ set from 3-6pm. The original plan was that she will uber to the bar we are at, then her BF realized they both are going to the same area around the same time so he said he will just drop her off, original ETA was 330pm. 330 passes, still waiting on him, 4 passes, 430, she doesn‚Äôt get there until 5pm & the SECOND he drops her off he texts her and i quote, ‚ÄúNot Good. Makes me second guess everything.‚Äù ALARM BELLS SOUNDING LEFT AND RIGHT. He continues texting her more narcissistic, manipulative phrases like ‚Äúwe‚Äôll talk when i get home.‚Äù ‚Äúnot happy‚Äù ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt tell me how big of an event it was.‚Äù 

KEEP IN MIND!! We were with a group of 6 other couples (including me & my boyfriend THAT HE‚ÄôS MET BEOFRE) and that was it. It was a very chill bar, we‚Äôre all sitting gathered around a table on the patio, absolutely nothing crazy going on. 

He continues to send her angry texts & she just decides to leave bc she‚Äôs crying at this point. She had been at the bar for all of 20m. I tried to tell her that this is exactly what he wants & he‚Äôs trying to manipulate you into going home & feeling like you did something wrong, & that this is textbook narcissistic abuse. She ultimately decided to leave because I quote ‚Äúhe‚Äôs going to be drinking a lot today & I don‚Äôt want to make it worse when he gets home‚Äù

I got flashbacks to my own abuse, I used to say that exact phrase when I was trying to convince myself that if I just behaved better, he would stop hitting me. Now, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on at home & I‚Äôm probably projecting to some degree but I can‚Äôt deny what I saw with my own two eyes. I told her I‚Äôm here for her & I won‚Äôt judge her & that I will continue supporting her but that she needs to reevaluate the relationship & quickly. 

So‚Ä¶ am i overreacting because of my history with abuse or does my friend really need help? Any advice is appreciated. TIA. ",2025-03-10 17:57:40,2025-03-17 03:29:48,help

Forthwrmore, one of our children's birthdays was two weeks ago and his other child's birthday (from his previous relationship) is today. Heard nothing at all from him on our baby's birthday and his family said they'd get her gifts this week (which to me is messed up that they'd wait to get it) and I've yet to hear anything since then. 

Today, my ex has been playing songs like ""Color him Father"" and a whole bunch of other stuff to paint himself as a great dad....on this other child's birthday. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, I'm so upset and more so because I just don't get it. How can someone really try to paint themselves as great knowing they're completely, literally, not doing anything at all or tryi it to be in his two youngest babies lives while pouring into another. 

For context: I found out he was abusive to his ex as well, which is a big reason why they broke up and her family cannot stand him. Their situations never had police involved. I don't know if things have changed now, but it also why she would never tell him where she lived and they'd have to exchange their child at her mothers house. I thought it was because he cheated on her..but I guess that was just a small part of the story.

1ii45j6,How can I help my daughter out of abusive relationship?,Daydream_Be1iever,3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ii45j6/how_can_i_help_my_daughter_out_of_abusive/,"My 17 yo is in an emotionally abusive relationship and has been for about one year. He converted her to his religion and has successfully isolated her from old friends.  She only hangs out with people at church now and is constantly on eggshells trying not to upset him.  I talk to her about the red flags I see and the things she should be looking for in a healthy relationship.   They have plans to get married bc his religion is very strict.  Currently they technically are not allowed to have any physical contact (hold hands, be alone in a car together, etc). 

Since they are so serious I‚Äôve offered to pay for couples counseling and have bought books for them to look at about healthy relationships. (There is a lot of coercive control and manipulation happening from his end) 

She is scared to mention anything of the sort to him and begs me not to intervene in any way.  I know that if I talk to his parents the relationship will be ended by them ASAP. I am so worried about her future with him that I‚Äôve considered doing that.  Any thoughts on what else I could do or whether you would speak with them? 

Edit: Context on levels of abuse: 

Mostly emotional abuse and possible escalation toward physical abuse. (She told me that she is afraid he will hit her someday because when he is ‚Äúpretending‚Äù to be violent he has grabbed her throat and shaken her previously) 

Emotional abuse including: not allowing her to have friends, berating her for ‚Äúmicro cheating‚Äù if she talks to any males at school, demanding that she be on FaceTime all night so he can keep tabs on her, demanding that she makes his lunch to bring to him at school and then getting upset when she doesn‚Äôt pack it correctly, invalidating her thoughts and feelings and intelligence. Becoming angry, moody, self harming, threatening suicide if she sets up boundaries. Punishing her by ignoring her and refusing to communicate when she goes on family trips, etc. 

Edit: our relationship- 

I‚Äôm a single mom and her dad has been minimally involved in her life since she was 12.  We have a trusting, strong relationship.  She talks to me about all of these things and listens but seems to feels very committed and stuck in the relationship. Our relationship is somewhat strained now partially bc it is easy to say the wrong thing to upset her, or if he is around, it‚Äôs easy to get her ‚Äúin trouble‚Äù with him and make things really bad for her later.

1ig5u6t,Has anyone on here actually gotten help from the DV shelter? I went to one and it was traumatizing and they made me regret leaving my ex,OkCheesecake7067,3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ig5u6t/has_anyone_on_here_actually_gotten_help_from_the/,"Im serious. People think DV shelters are safe
But the one I went to wasnt. They (the workers) spent more time scrutinizing my parenting and accusing me of things that I didnt do. And they let some of the residents yell at me when my baby cried. I wad also falsely accused of stealing food
They also had no resources to help me get independence. I was not elegible for any of the resources that they had. A couple of their workers also screamed at me when I had a panic attack because of how some of their residents treated me. I also witnessed several of the moms there hitting/spanking their children in front of the cameras and in front of everyone. 

The DV shelter was a very traumatizing experience and helped me realize that leaving my ex was a huge mistake. 

The workers also kept asking me over and over and over and over if I can stay with family. They even called my family to confirm it. And the shelter that I went to after that (the family shelter) was similar but the DV shelter was worse. 

I have a home now but its not because of the shelter. I rented a room for me and my son to share and the house has roommates. (The government housing list was full so obviously that did not help either) 

I was not elegible for their motel to home program either because the motel to home program was paid for through the school system and my son is not old enough to be in school yet.

When I applied for TANF they lost my application. I applied for it in person at the office cause they did not allow me to apply for it online. 

And the family shelter coincidentally happened to be located RIGHT NEXT DOOR to one of my exs favorite places. (It was a store that my ex introduced me to that had only one location. He took me there a long time ago before we officially started dating)

I should be happy that I have a room now but I honestly miss living with my ex cause it felt like more of a family setting. 

All the shelter workers that asked me if I can stay with family didnt seem to realize that my ex/ baby daddy was the only ""family"" that me and my son had that actually cared about me.

So can I help someone who hasn‚Äôt asked me for help?


Here‚Äôs the situation:


I‚Äôm not that close with my sister in law, and I think that is by design from her husband. He doesn‚Äôt let her get close to anybody.


They have two young children, and he has decided to move them overseas, back to his home country. She does not speak the language. She knows no one there. She will be living with his mother and brother in a remote village. 


He will stay behind for 3 months, then join them there.


A few days ago I got a moment alone with her, and told her she can‚Äôt get on that plane.


She doesn‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶ but she feels she has no other option. She can‚Äôt work with two small children, and they aren‚Äôt vaccinated so aren‚Äôt allowed in daycare.


I don‚Äôt think she is aware of hague convention laws that are often abused to separate expat mothers from their children.


I want to help her. But I don‚Äôt know how. 


To be clear she has not explicitly asked for my help. 


To be clear there is a lot of assumption on my part here. But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm wrong‚Ä¶‚Ä¶


Is there any way I can help her?


My very real fear is her partner (illegally) owns multiple assault rifles. They are in a safe in their house. I‚Äôm not convinced he wouldn‚Äôt use them‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶


They leave in less than a week.


Any advice is appreciated. 


Thank you.

1idlmbg,Help me stay strong and remind me not get back with me ex,Illustrious_Let_1017,6,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1idlmbg/help_me_stay_strong_and_remind_me_not_get_back/,"Me (34f) and my ex (36m) and I were together for 8 years and I broke up with him about 8 months ago. I had a health scare, he wasn‚Äôt supportive and that was a turning point for me. I got therapy which helped me learn to love myself and set boundaries, and importantly see things more clearly which eventually led me to exit the relationship. 

I‚Äôm doing pretty well (on paper) since the break up. Got a promotion at work, pursuing my hobbies, keeping physically and mentally fit etc (quit smoking), expanding social circle etc.

The problem I am facing is a pull back to him, he continues to reach out and want to meet up and I genuinely want to stay in touch and be civil.

I have been lurking on reddit for years and am well aware of the hook that trauma bonds have on us and I guess I am after a reminder and some reassurance that going back to him or even entertaining the idea is not in anyone‚Äôs best interest. I know cold turkey / no contact is the best way but why does it feel so fucking hard?

To summarise very briefly our whole relationship we would have massive blow up arguments, where I‚Äôd be yelled at and told how selfish I was and how everything was my fault, that I was crazy and needed help. Then no speaking for several days, maybe a week. This could be over really small trivial things. I can very easily tap into those highly stressful and anxious feelings right now, and I fear if that will that ever go away? I worry that I am so damaged from it all that all I deserve is the person that did that to me because they were the only person that could make it all ok again - once they come around and act like nothing happened , showing me love and everything is ok.

I wanted kids with him so much, and would be told that I was too immature to be a mother. Now because of my health issues as well as getting older, I don‚Äôt even know if having kids will be a reality for me now and honestly it‚Äôs that that hurts me the most. That I so wanted children with the man I loved and he shut me down for years. I won‚Äôt go into marriage but I told him I wanted that too but he also told me that although he wanted to marry me he didn‚Äôt want to spend the money on a ring.

I‚Äôm not really sure exactly the purpose me posting but I guess I need a reminder and some assurance that I have already done the hardest job, which is leaving, and I will only makes things harder for myself if I start hooking back up and getting back into that relationship.

1jczfap,I need help,bajatoad,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jczfap/i_need_help/,"Hello, I really need to know if I‚Äôm in the wrong or crazy. 

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend since last February and things have gotten really bad. I met him in January and at the time he was 17, then turning 18 in April (I was 18 going on 19 later that year in October). I had just gotten out of a five year abusive relationship with my ex. 

It started in March when he started to treat me bad, but he would always say how he‚Äôs a bad boyfriend. Quickly after, he would start calling me names like ‚Äúwhore, bitch, stupid, idiot, retarded‚Ä¶‚Äù etc. He would say that we were breaking up, but the next day everything would be back to normal again. 

He doesn‚Äôt give me the same respect that I give him. I removed all lot of guys off my phone for him, without him having to ask, because I saw that they made him feel uncomfortable. He would make remarks about the guys on my phone so I just removed them. 

Sometime in March we got into a fight and he came down to see me. (For better context, my ex abused me mentally and physically so I grew very nervous around men) We were sitting near pond and I guess I was speaking over him and he threatened to hit me if I didn‚Äôt stop talking. 

I started to get really depressed because of this and I couldn‚Äôt hide it anymore. He would constantly say that I need to get better and I really was trying to get better, but he would make it worse, so I didn‚Äôt know how. He constantly blamed everything on me. 

(Because of my ex, I didn‚Äôt trust him 100% in the beginning and I was nervous a lot. My ex would constantly cheat, manipulate, and abuse me everyday for 5 years, so yeah.. that did a number on me) My boyfriend knows what my ex did to me and still continued to abuse me mentally. 

In August I went up on the train to see him because we had a big argument and he was ignoring me. (He stonewalls me every time he‚Äôs mad and I can‚Äôt take it. He knows that I have really bad abandonment issues because of my childhood, and still did it to hurt me.) He picked me up from the train station and all he did was verbally abuse me. I was bawling my eyes out and trying to hold his arm for comfort and he said that he was going to kill me/us and crash the car. Later that day we went to a carnival together and he acted like nothing ever happened. 

I personally think that porn or watching anything online is cheating. (That‚Äôs just me.) The other day he said that he was on Reddit and then I heard sounds of him jerking off. I asked if that‚Äôs what he was doing and he said no. I brought it up the next day and he said that he was watching stuff I‚Äôve sent him. But his stories aren‚Äôt lining up, he constantly does this and gaslights me. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy in my head. He‚Äôs really good at manipulating people and making me seem like the crazy girlfriend. 

Last night I went through his phone because I had suspicions of him cheating. There was nothing on his Reddit, but when I went into Snapchat, there were multiple girls on there. He was telling girls to pull up to a festival that he was at, and I couldn‚Äôt go that day. So I woke him up and confronted him. It went terribly. He got in my face and called me a retard and many other things. He started punching my bed and said that if he didn‚Äôt do that, then he would punch me. I was able to record what he said. He left but came back later that night and ignored me. This morning I asked him if we could talk about it again and it went bad aswell. He said that I need to get myself together and that I need to get better and I need to go back to the pychward to get better. (I went years ago because I tried to off myself because my ex was telling me to take more pills and that I was worthless.) He told me that he doesn‚Äôt care about me and he won‚Äôt remove the girls. 

My problem with the girls is that he told me he removed them, and lied to me about it, and he doesn‚Äôt show any signs of remorse. I would never add or talk to guys behind his back. I just want the same respect back. He tells me that I‚Äôm insecure and crazy, but he‚Äôs a very insecure person. I always tell him how handsome he is, and that I love every part of him (and I really do.) Last week he went through my following and sent me a picture of my cousin and said ‚ÄúWTF WERE OVER‚Äù. I told him that it was my cousin but he still blocked me. He came back the next day. 

I‚Äôm exhausted and he‚Äôs taken everything out of me. 

And I know that I‚Äôm not perfect at all, and I do make mistakes, but I don‚Äôt purposefully try to hurt him. I‚Äôve definitely changed since we first started dating. In our first argument I asked if he was stupid (I didn‚Äôt know how to communicate at that time and just had left my abusive ex), he told me not to speak to him like that, and it clicked in my head. I didn‚Äôt want to become what my ex was, and I knew i didn‚Äôt want to treat him like that. For months I worked on myself, but he would say that I wasn‚Äôt changing at all. But I knew I was changing. 

He wonders why I don‚Äôt trust him, but he constantly lies about small things and it makes me wonder if he lies about bigger things too. On Thanksgiving I caught him with a vape and he said that he didn‚Äôt care. He told me to stop smoking weed back in March, so I stopped. So it really hurt to find out that he didn‚Äôt care and was going to continue if he didn‚Äôt get caught. A little part of me still believes that he‚Äôs doing it. 

(I‚Äôm new to Reddit so I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt understand too much hhh. I‚Äôm also sorry if things are in a weird order, I‚Äôm writing this as things come to my mind.) ",2025-03-16 23:55:01,2025-03-17 03:31:07,help

I'm posting here bc I feel like this community would be well rounded and able to look at things in an unbiased way (hopefully). While this does seem like an abuse-type tactic I don't know that my wife is intentionally being ""bad"". I am also to blame, I know I'm not good at communication.

I (30f) am autistic & I make a lot of scrunch faces and often close my eyes while I'm processing information. Specially when there's a lot of other noises going on. I also have an extremely stunted understanding of emotions/feelings. My wife often gets her feelings hurt by this and has recently begun just stopping mid-sentence and walking away from me. (Which triggers some sort of extreme rejection sensitivity in myself or something? I'm not sure). I have tried to explain to her multiple times that I'm not mad at her, I'm not upset with her, I'm listening and thinking and processing. She says ""I see your frustration and it hurts my heart""(that feels so needlessly dramatic to me but probably bc I don't have a very strong emotional range for anything). Idk how to fix that bc there's no frustration until she starts to walk away and I've told her that. Like NOW there's frustration bc you're stopping mid conversation, asserting I'm feeling a way that I'm not, and shutting down the conversation?

Today she was telling me about a friend of hers who she often compares me to and telling me something he did to alleviate his social anxiety/ stress. As I'm listening I'm thinking about a few things:

a)I'm tired of hearing about him tbh.

b)What she's describing isn't how I feel about/during/after social interactions.

c)how can I tell her I appreciate her concern but I don't feel that way without upsetting her.

And I guess in my processing & thinking I furrowed my brow/pursed my lips so she said ""ok I see your frustration, I'm going."" and tossed her hands up in the air, started to tear up, and started to walk away. I told her I wasn't frustrated about the conversation but now I'm frustrated bc she's doing the thing. She said it hurts her heart too much to see me look so frustrated. I'm like ??? tf I was literally processing. I told her if she keeps walking away from me mid conversation like this I know myself and I'm gonna eventually stop having conversations with her at all bc I will be too anxious that I'll upset her and I know my anxiety will tell me things like 'she doesn't care about what we have to contribute. She doesn't care about my thoughts and feelings.' and that's going to ruin any communication we have. We start arguing bc now she's saying I'm calling her crazy bc I'm saying she's misinterpreting my facial expressions and storms off. I shut the bedroom door and make myself a little pillow nest in the corner of the bed to try to destress and not cry. ( Our bed is in the corner against the wall bc it's comforting for me to be able to lean fully against the wall surrounded by pillows and blankets). Not 5 minutes goes by and she comes back to the bedroom. I hear her and before she opens the door I let her know ""I don't want to talk to you right now. I want to be alone please."" She comes in anyway. I say again ""I don't want to talk to you, I want to be alone."" She approaches me. ""I want to be alone. I want to be alone."" I'm curled up in the corner repeating myself. She starts talking over me about how she's going to sit and allow me to speak without interrupting me and sits on the edge of the bed. I shut down, turn away from her and pull a blanket over me. She set an alarm for 5 minutes and sat close to me in silence waiting. I'm getting sweaty, my heart is racing, I'm trying so hard not to cry. The alarm goes off, she gets up, says I love you and leaves.

?????

I don't know how to feel about this. I don't know how to process this. I'm feeling confused and violated and definitely far from loved. What am I supposed to do in this situation? How am I supposed to react or respond?",2025-01-25 19:43:55,2025-03-17 03:31:14,help

Everything between us is great on a day to day basis. He moved in with me about a year ago and he's always been sweet and helpful, he's great with my dog and he always does everything he can to help me and make me happy.

However he has mental issues and when he drinks sometimes he turns into a total monster and becomes someone i despise. He has rage fits and I hate that person. It has happened 4 times now in the time we've been together. The first time he got upset ( i dont remember what caused it) and tried to drive away when he was wasted and being a dummy and I tried to stop him but he ended up dragging me out of his car and I had a searingly painful road rash on my lower back from him dragging me away. 
The second time he went on a rampage because it was the anniversary of his mom dying and he was dealing with overhlwhelming emotions. He ended up destroying things that mostly belonged to him but he also broke an heirloom of mine and broke my bedroom door and my front door is cracked because it's made of glass and he kicked it. he promised to fix them but due to lack of money they  havnt been fixed in almost a year. I called the cops that night but he was asleep by the time they got there and they couldn't arrest him or anything. I got a call from the district attorneys office and told them to please not charge him because it was still new to me and I felt like it's a one off thing and I didn't want his life and my life to be harder than it already was. 

The third time I honestly don't even remember the details. But this past Friday was the fourth time and what happened was we were having fun with a couple of our dude friends at our house. The breaking point was when one of them lightly touched my butt and I made a joke being like ""babe he touched my butt hahaha"" and that made him lose it. He got out of control and the friend also got ready to fight him. I was holding my bf from the back of his pants to keep them away from each other while they were screaming at each other. The other friend who was also trying to diffuse was more near the other guy trying to hold him back. He, let's say is jake, finally was able to get, let's call him Sam, out of the house. But my bf was screaming and trying to chase both of them even though they were already leaving. I was still trying to calm my bf down even though I know now I should have just left as well. Well he ended up grabbing me by my head and screaming in my ear I don't even remember what he was saying but i couldn't break free I just kinda went limp and waited for it to stop, and then he went for the door and my dumb ass went to stop him again because I just didn't want any more turmoil with our friends but he ended up grabbing me by my face and almost took my eye and next thing I know I'm laying in a bush cuz he threw me. At some point he came back in the house and I told him he needs to leave. But he pulled the whole I pay rent here thing so I told him I'm going to get my neighbor who knows our situation and has told me to get him if I ever need him, so I told my bf I'm getting the neighbor. I left and immediately woke my neighbor when we got back to my house my bf was already outside with some extra clothes and said ""I'm leaving "". My neighbor stayed with me the whole night and next day to make sure I was okay. 
It feels good to get all this wrote down and have other people know I guess. But my point is I need support making a really difficult decision. I still feel the same as the last times it happened where I want to forgive him and work on things. But last time it happened I told him it would be that last time I tolerated that shit and I'm having internal issues getting the ability to stick to that. 

Like I said 99 percent of the time things are great, but add alcohol to him it's a huge risk and he sometimes comes home like that. I need help finding the strength. 

I wish I could articulate everything better but I did my best. Let me know if anything doesn't make sense. I think I know what everyone will tell me, I just need to hear it many times, hense why I'm posting this. Thank you if you made it this far.

Tldr: my bf can't control his rage when he's drunk. Is awesome when he doesn't, but still chooses to drink at times when he knows what it can lead to. I told him last time was the last I'd tolerate it and here we are again. I need support in finding the strength to do what I should do, which is either giving him a full stop ultimatum or just ending it all together. ",2025-02-23 22:16:49,2025-03-17 03:31:15,help

I live in Indiana and just found out that after a week of communication silence, that a female friend of mine is possibly being physically abused and her communications monitored by her husband.

I know that she was being mentally abused and put into some extreme situations by her spouse, she was working on all of that.

She has contact with her mom whom lives near to her.

He is a stupid ""TRAD"" eg traditional husband. He expects her to pop out babies and forgo her studies to stay at home and do everything.

He won't let her go out alone unless it's to work.

We are currently having to wait for safe msg's to be sent to myself or another BF of hers. I think she is currently trying to find a way to communicate with her mom (that's what it sounds like).

I am considering sending her a burner phone with minutes to her school in attention to her.

Can anyone please direct me to proper programs and help in SC for situations like this?

Also, is the burner phone a good idea or is it dangerous to introduce that into the situation?

Please help with any type of assistance and ideas.

Please no stories unless they come with possible solutions.

Thank you all in advance.

1iv559u,"I think my sister's husband may be emotionally abusive, and I don't know how to help her.",LemonZest-Shark,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iv559u/i_think_my_sisters_husband_may_be_emotionally/,"Hello, I have really been struggling with this situation for a while, and I would really appreciate any advice I can get.

My younger sister Jane(22F) has been married to her husband Will(22M) for two years, they dated for under a year before they were engaged. We met Will in late 2020, and he became a part of Jane and my close friend group. I initially found connecting with Will difficult as he seemed to be very guarded. But over time he bonded with the friend group, and I would say we became genuine friends. After several months of friendship, I could tell he and Jane seemed to be interested in one another. The longer Will was interested in Jane the more she seemed to distance herself from friends. We would hang out as a group, and the entire time Will and Jane would be in a different room, only talking to each other, or leave to sit and talk in Wills car alone. I know that two people who are interested in each other, especially when you are that young, are going to hyper focus on one another. But this was so different from my sister's typical demeanor. She was outgoing and loved hosting and creating warm and friendly environments. Others from the friend group started expressing their hurt feeling over being ignored by Jane. Then Jane and Will became official, and I saw Will really try to bond with me and my parents. It seemed that they both turned a corner when they became official, and Will really tried to win my parents over. Will and Jane got engaged after less than a year with my parents blessing. Thats when I really started to notice a difference, a bunch of little things, but all added together it seems suspicious in hindsight. They both really pulled away from the family and from friends after the engagement. I had to have confrontations and discussion with them because I caught them partaking in spreading rumors about me and my fianc√©. Jane was crying constantly, Will seemed to be angry when she talked with our mom about wedding plans, Will had to approve every wedding decision down to the color of the plates at the reception. Jane had to talk with Will on every work break, Janes weight fluctuated drastically, and her clothing style changed. She had a more feminine flowing style, wearing pastels, floral prints and cardigans. She suddenly changed to wearing a lot more leather, dark tones, and generally dressed more revealing. I want to be clear, I believe women can wear whatever they want, I have no issue with the clothes, it's the rapid change in style to match what Wills desire was. The wedding came and went, and Janes relationship with our parents has continued to disintegrate. Will has barraged our mom, accusing her of being a bad mom, of not caring for Jane, any many hurtful things in the same vein. Jane went from my best friend and closest confidant to us being no contact. Jane will pop into our parent's place to pick up something, and Will sits in the car honking his horn and texting her to leave. This is not a one off, Will does this every time my sister tries to have a conversation with our parents.

Just one of these things is not enough to be concerned. But looking back over the last four years, my sister is a completely different person; she was tight with her family, was bubbly and sweet, and we were best friends. She used to have a thriving friend group, and now only speaks to Wills family. And Will has only seemed to get more controlling and self-centered as time goes on. The main problem is that Jane is obsessed with him, she has this vision that they are the best most healthy couple. It's like when she said, 'I do', Will transplanted his brain into her head and now she is a puppet. My question reddit is this: How do I support my sister who thinks I am against her in every way, and how do I know if she is safe?

Edit: I forgot to add that Jane used to have her own thriving business. Will constantly encouraged her to shrink and limit her customers and time invested in her business till she quit. And now is 100% financially dependent on Will.",2025-02-21 23:34:35,2025-03-17 03:31:18,help

1icblen,Do DV organizations and shelters actually help people?,Content_Cat8466,6,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1icblen/do_dv_organizations_and_shelters_actually_help/,"My therapist wants me to reach out to a DV shelter in the town we will be moving to in 6 months to start getting info so I can make a better plan to leave. My issues with leaving are I have 2 toddlers, haven't worked in over 5 years and can't even work in my degree field anymore, have no income or savings for myself so have no money for an apartment on my own, etc. He said the DV Shelter/Organization might have connections and info on lawyers who work with DV victims on sliding scale and specialize in child custody issues with DV (he's never hurt the kids, but we all know it's just a matter of time), and that they might be able to help me find a job and an apartment.

I feel like they probably won't be able to help in most of these areas. He said what harm does it do to call and ask. I know it doesn't hurt to ask but I guess I'm scared to find out they can't help me or they'll tell me that what I'm experiencing isnt that bad compared to others (and it's not, but hearing someone say that well would just kill my little bit of resolve to leave the relationship). It doesn't help that it's a military town and my husband is a high ranking officer. So the second someone finds that out about me I feel like the perception is ""You are an officer's wife, you have money and resources most couldn't dream of, you don't need our help"". I've experienced that a little at my current post, my advocate constantly makes assumptions about me and my safety plan and my life because I am an officer's wife, and I have a college degree and dress nicely.

I've also refused to involve the police and it seems most places expect you to do that if you really want help. I've read reviews of the DV shelter/organization and it's very mixed. It very much sounds like if they deem you worthy to help they do everything they can to help you and if not you're SOL. I also don't know if they'll even talk to me at all since I don't live there yet. Surely I can't be the first person who wants to leave a DV situation after a planned move and wants info before arriving there??

So... Food is starting to run low. So I have been considering breaking no contact with my ex to ask for a bit of help. If not her, then my abusive narcissistic father. It would break my heart and spirit to do that but I'm starting to feel I have no choice.

Should I do it? If so, how should I handle it? Which of these two chuckefucks should I crawl to to beg for help? Any advice would be appreciated. I want a cheeseburger so bad, lol.

Upset, she asked me why I didn't clean, and I said because I forgot. Then she asked me, ""Oh, and what did you do at home today? Just did the dishes, right!?"" and I replied, ""I did the dishes, cleaned the cat's litter box, and worked on university stuff"", to which she responded, ""Oh, don't tell me"" in a completely dismissive tone. She continued to complain while I was cooking rice with headphones on, but one ear was uncovered so I could hear her. She didn't like that I ignored her and lost it. She yanked the headphones off my head and hit me with them on the head, and I yelled, ""You stupid, you hit me on the head!"" because it hurt a lot, as the headphones are still heavy, to which she shouted back, ""Shut up before you get hit!"" and called me a ""fucking bitch"" and yelled at me to leave the kitchen because, according to her, I don't know how to do anything right. I left and slammed the kitchen door hard. 

I am now sitting in my room and don't know what to do. This whole situation seems ridiculous and surreal. Unfortunately, this is not the first time such things have happened; as far back as I can remember, she has always been like this. She loses it over trivial things and thinks she can say and do whatever she wants. This behaviour extends to my father and grandfather who live in the house. Although my mother doesn't physically harm them, she hurts them with harsh words and insults over minor things that didn't even require such reactions. I think she has anger issues or maybe even a personality disorder, but I don't think it's an excuse for her actions. 

Today was the last straw, and I can't stand living here anymore. I won't tolerate her disrespect anymore and want to move out of this house. 

About two months ago, I had a big argument with my mother for similar reasons, and I almost left home. I was going to move into a shared apartment with university students in my city. I already had the key and everything, but when my mother saw that I was serious and saw me packing, she immediately regretted acting foolishly and started crying, begging me to stay living at home with her. I thought that situation from two months ago made her realize that she needed to change her behaviour, but apparently not. 

The problem is, at the moment, I only have 93‚Ç¨ in my bank account. I would have to work part-time the entire month of December to have enough money to rent a room in an apartment or house with other university students. However, I really don't want to live in this house, walking on ""eggshells"" for another month. Therefore, I have been thinking about asking the bank for a 500‚Ç¨ loan. However, I don't know if the bank will grant me a 500‚Ç¨ loan with a part-time contract. 

If you could give me advice, I would be immensely grateful.",2023-11-26 02:06:13,2025-03-17 03:33:19,domestic violence

So I was taking with my friends about somethings that my now ex boyfriend did and they were horrified, although to me I knew it wasn‚Äôt good but I didn‚Äôt think it was that bad.

So the most glaring thing is that sometimes when I was being annoying he‚Äôd slap me in the face. I‚Äôd beg him to be quieter sometimes because I was worried someone else would hear, he‚Äôd only hit me harder. But I mean he never hit me in anger, granted I usually apologized and caved before he ever got angry with me, I tried to hard to be a good boyfriend and not make him upset. Is this normal or just something small that I shouldn‚Äôt be upset about? Even posting in here makes me feel so guilty for even thinking it could be something bad that he could be bad. I know it‚Äôs not fair to him for me to ask but my friends I‚Äôve told about it called it dv and just idk. He did a lot of other stuff that they also called that but none of it was physical and I was probably remembering wrong or exaggerating anyways. Which I feel really bad about because they know him, or at least used to and I don‚Äôt want to speak poorly of him when it‚Äôs probably just my imagination. 

But um is that something that would be considered DV? Thank you so much any comments are really greatly appreciated",2023-01-28 01:33:45,2025-03-17 03:33:24,domestic violence

I am in an abusive relationship. There are feelings that everyone feel, and then there is behaviour that people CHOOSE, yes choose to engage in. 

There is no such thing as mutual abuse. It is a myth. That's what the person at the hotline said, because I was questioning myself.

I started it, I pushed her to this point, maybe I was abusive first. 

Lots of feelings right now. Guilt, for leaving her because she's been there for me through my rough days. Shame, for even being in the position I'm in now. Sadness, anger, confusion, grief. All of them.

I am in an abusive relationship. It is not my fault. I will be okay. I don't owe her anything. I will take accountability for my actions and words. I know I did wrong too. This will be hard but worth it. 

Continue working on me. Do not give in and go to couples counselling with her, it will not help.

Just now he threatened me in the car and terrorized me, he's been non stop calling me awful names and telling me im worthless and stupid and if i get upset he asks me why im upset while he's cornering me and saying his famous words 'i'm getting angry' which means hes warning me hes going to hit me.

i have panic attacks and constant fear, fight, and flight responses to him that i cannot control. tonight i said that unless he stops im leaving and he basically disowned our baby daughter and said pack her shit and leave.

now hes saying hes sorry and he wants intervention and conseling after refusing before. its really just more for my sanity that a neutral third professional party hears and sees this and amkes me feel like im not everything he says i am and i dont deserve this and im not worthless. i lie to my family, his family, his treatment/legal program, his friends and he tells people hes this amazing fatherhood hero so its humiliating and i want him to hear from a professional what this level of abuse does to people.

he doesnt believe it was serious or affected me and says i play the victim and need to get over it and grow up.

is there some online intervention session we can do where this can be explained to a third party and he can hear it from them that what hes doing is wrong and damaging?",2023-07-18 22:19:05,2025-03-17 03:33:26,domestic violence

13wd6qj,Is this domestic violence?,Any_Carrot2469,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/13wd6qj/is_this_domestic_violence/,"Background: Husband (40M) and I (33F) have been together 14 years (married 8) and have a child under 2 years old. It feels silly to ask this question but I feel like because he hasn‚Äôt physically hit me that it‚Äôs not technically abuse. I also feel stupid because I brought our child into this but I thought all of this was in the past. I was brought up with an abusive step parent and the last thing I want in this world is for my child to grow up in an abusive environment. I suffer from PTSD, depression, anxiety, and anorexia as a direct result of my traumatic upbringing and have a regular therapist and psychiatrist and also take medication. My husband has never been even remotely abusive to our child. 

Story: my husband suffers from terrible anger issues that he has had from day 1 of our relationship. It mostly flares up with his drinking. He is otherwise a very intelligent person who has taken on majority of the childcare (I went back to work) and does most of the cooking/cleaning. He is a progressive person (I am probably trying to justify his behaviour already). 

Prior to our child being born we had big fights infrequently (once every couple months) that were usually after he was drinking too much. Usually during these fights he rants about stuff like me not helping out enough around the house, but most of the time he talked in circles and seemed to just want to argue. I would be called a fucking cunt or bitch constantly during these arguments. These fights have occurred more frequently (once/week) since our child was born and many times do not involve alcohol. 

In terms of violence, in the past he has grabbed both my upper arms and squeezed them as hard as he could and it left bruises on both my arms that I had to hide for a week (I still have photos). He did this while drunk because I wouldn‚Äôt get up from sitting on a step and follow him home from a restaurant. He was angry in this scenario because there was a liquor store nearby that was on my google maps that said it was ‚Äúopen‚Äù but when we got there it was closed. He blamed it being closed on me and got angry at me. He regularly blames me for things that are not my fault and will get angry if I make mistakes or have any sort of accident. He gets road rage and has swerved on a road saying he‚Äôs going to crash the car because he was so angry with me. He has lifted our couch up and almost dropped it on our cat during an angry drunk episode. He has hit and punched numerous items around our house when angry (he has put a hole in a wall at his workplace after hours when drinking and he got angry). He has thrown things at me (clothes hangers and food). He has grabbed my arms and shaken me many years ago. More recently I didn‚Äôt want to go to the gym so he grabbed both my wrists hard and pulled me from the couch while I was fighting to get away from him and yelling at him to let go - just so that I would stop being ‚Äúlazy‚Äù (I was 6 months post partum and just got home from work) - he was sober during this incident. He recently also has grabbed my phone from my hands forcefully hurting my hands by bending my fingers back because I was videoing him during these scenarios as I was scared he would hurt me. He has forcefully grabbed my phone from me many times when drunk and threatened to break it or take it. Recently he threatened to throw our baby bassinet through the window if I took my son to my moms (I didn‚Äôt feel safe at home and wanted to leave with my son). He then got really close to me and said in a threatening voice ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do this‚Äù so I stayed home as I was scared he was going to hurt me and break things. He has also forcefully grabbed our child from me while I struggled and yelled ‚Äúno‚Äù while he was drunk because he didn‚Äôt want me to ‚Äútake him away‚Äù from him. I have this video recorded. He is usually always yelling at me when he‚Äôs drinking and likes to minimize me and break down my self confidence and self worth. He can talk for an hour about what a ‚Äúpiece of shit‚Äù I am and the reasons why. He will stand right up against me blocking my path when I am trying to argue my position as if he‚Äôs trying to intimidate me. He has also threatened suicide multiple times (including since our child was born) when I say I don‚Äôt want to be in this relationship. He has gone as far to bring a straight razor into a full bathtub with his clothes on and lock the door. He has also opened our patio door (we live in a high level suite) and looked over the edge as if implying to jump. He is constantly gaslighting me trying to say I said certain things or did certain things that I didn‚Äôt just to make him look better or make his story make sense.",2023-05-31 05:19:03,2025-03-17 03:33:28,domestic violence

Since the beginning of the relationship he has been lying about going to the bars. He's also been caught doing stupid things on Snapchat and Facebook. He an on the road worker. I relocated to a few states away, away from friends and family. I started to notice he had a pattern of going to his hometown and then the bar. He wouldn't answer my calls and when he did he was a complete asshole. We have had a few instances where I've gotten really upset bc he continues to lie to me. I am new in a new town and I am sitting at home trying to be a ""good girl"" while he's at home getting shitfaced. Last weekend we were back in his hometown and I noticed there was a bunch of booze drank. He told me he didn't drink at all the prior weekend and that he only went into the bar to cash a check. Then when I saw the bottle I confronted him he blamed his buddy for drinking it. He always gets really defensive and will double down on his lies. I said I don't believe that your buddy drank it and that you happened to be in the bar. I probably wouldn't care if you went to the bar occasionally but you keep lying and then you try to prove your not lying by staring me straight in the eyes. He's been crazymaking the whole time we've been together. This time we got into a actual physical fight. He choked me out and his kids were home and the 14yo called the cops and he got hauled off to jail. I spoke to the DA and said that he's not normally abusive so they are willing to put him on a deferred sentence. He was upset that wasn't good enough. Then he started to lie about the whole situation saying ""I never choked you"" in most states that is a felony. I told him he should be grateful he's getting it deferred for LIKE offenses, so just don't do anything stupid for a year. I got upset eventually bc he was twisting everything and just lying to himself about the situation like he's trying to make it real in his head that he didn't do anything. I feel insane myself anymore. I've been thinking about going to Al-Anon, I have a therapy appointment tomorrow.

But they are still violence. 

The purpose is to cause fear and intimidation by aggressive displays of their physical dominance or control over your physical safety. 

And when one person is willing to participate in violence and the other is not, that gives them power. They are willing to get that power through fear. 

These may include:

- Driving recklessly with me in the car 
- Throwing objects close to or towards me 
- Smashing or breaking property close to me where glass or wood splinters are flying 
- Continuing aggressive and intimidating  behaviour when they can see I am in a state of physical distress from the stress of their abuse i.e. having cardiac symptoms from stress, and they do not stop, they keep going. This puts my health and safety at risk.  

Another abusive act that my abuser does is harm themselves through destruction of property by punching walls or slamming furniture etc. 

This is still using aggression and fear for power because 

1) Then my entire focus shifts off of their abusive behaviour to if they are they okay and I have to tend to their injuries 

2) I am then left to always be mitigating every situation out of not only fear that they will cause me harm but also cause themselves harm, and I don‚Äôt ever know what they are going to do or how far they are going to take that. 

I just don‚Äôt see these forms of domestic violence and their intentions discussed so often.

In this relationship I suffered physical, emotional and financial abuse. I couldn't bring myself to file a formal charges of the abuse because I was still in love with the abuser. Now months have passed since I was granted a restraining order and my feelings have changed.

I maybe love myself more because I realize how cruel it was for someone to have had such a great level of disrespect to do everything this person has done to me. It was humiliating and emotionally and physically damaging. I have a scar from a time of abuse, I was stolen which amounts to thousands of dollars and I can't stop thinking about going and pressing charges of all the threats, of the times physical abuse happened and everything.

I am a Christian and now I am much closer to God and it feels wrong to go and press charges. I know how much everyone preaches about forgiveness but it still hurts when I think how I could let someone treat me that way. It damages my self - esteem and makes me feel like nothing when someone could have had such a great level of disrespect to me. The stealing, the violence, the threats, the stalking. I also feel like I should let the authorities know everything that has happened, at least to have more protection in the future if anything where to happen.

I believe my boyfriend is mentally and emotionally abusive. 

He is hypercritical. Tells me I am raising my children wrong, and they will stay ""babies"" and ""dependent on me."" He yells at me, putting me down, telling me I can't manage my money. He frequently gets super annoyed with me for being ""lazy"" because I didn't run the roomba, mop the floors, clean the bathroom and otherwise engage my time productively. Instead, I played games on my phone and watched TV WHEN I wasn't taking care of/shuttling my children around to counseling, occupational therapy, soccer practice, etc. 

I don't work BECAUSE OF my 2 special needs children. One of children only goes to school right now until 11:30a. Plus they have all the above appts. I, too, have lots of appts. bc I have mental and physical health issues. 

He will give me a hard time about those, too, telling me I need to lose weight, that I need to take better care of myself. 

My boyfriend has a history of DV. He had to take anger management and DV classes 7 years ago when his son was removed by CPS/DCFS. He failed to reunify bc of his issues despite finishing the classes. 

His son's mom reunified; however she committed suicide last September and now my boyfriend is trying to reunify with his son a second time. It's added a lot of stress. 

I thought I wasn't a victim of DV because he wasn't hitting me...the way he did his previous baby moms. As far as I know, he's had no physical DV in 7 years. I thought he'd had none. But...thinking about past girlfriends, and then now my situation...DV can be more than just physical, I guess, right?",2022-05-01 02:10:51,2025-03-17 03:33:44,domestic violence

There was another man outside who walked up at the same time and and he and I basically just started yelling at the guy and he stopped and walked away and the woman walked to me. The other guy who intervened walked away and the girl and I went to the pool to talk. She made excuses that he doesnt drink often and only gets this way when he drinks.

We both had physical and mental health issues before we met and those things have always been a part of our relationship.

Over the few years my husband‚Äôs anger and depression have gotten worse. It was greatly impacting all of us and I reached a breaking point and asked him to move out for a while so he could focus on his health. And so our son and I could have a more predictable routine and less drama. So, he went to stay at his parent‚Äôs house just after Christmas.

Since he moved out, he has spent time with our son T and T loves spending time with his dad. But on the two occasions when all 3 of us spent time together at our home, he had major angry outbursts including punching a take out container and sending food flying, breaking a plastic storage box, throwing toys, punching cabinets etc and screaming. 

In both cases, I took our T upstairs and waited for my husband to calm down and then I asked him to leave. He refused to leave. I wanted to latch the interior lock on the door and go to bed, but he wouldn‚Äôt go. I talked about how we needed this to be a safe/stable space for T and this behavior was not ok around me or our son. He eventually left, but on his terms.

My individual therapist characterized this behavior as a form of domestic violence. I was surprised to hear that term associated with this and I‚Äôm overwhelmed by it.

When my husband and I talked about these episodes, he minimized them, said his behavior wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal and that if I was so upset by it maybe I needed more mental health support and that maybe he should live here with our son so I could take care of my needs.

Angel Flight and Mercy Flight offer free flights to victims of domestic abuse. Here's the list of websites by region: https://aircharitynetwork.org/request-a-flight/

Also, consider calling your local crisis center and asking about a grant for your transportation. They may be able to pay for a ticket.

Lastly, Uber has a program called Driving Change and they will give free rides to domestic violence victims. Just call your local shelter and ask for a voucher. If they participate in the program they will give you a voucher/code for a free ride.

If you know of other programs let us all know!",2022-04-19 10:57:16,2025-03-17 03:33:55,domestic violence
qpy95e,my parents are in a toxic relationship. i think my dad has been abusive and i want my mom to leave. TW: domestic violence,Alarmed_Nobody_9259,13,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/qpy95e/my_parents_are_in_a_toxic_relationship_i_think_my/,"hey so i‚Äôve been trying to deal with this for a while but i just can‚Äôt decide what to do by myself and i have no one to turn to, so i‚Äôm here to ask for help. i‚Äôm sorry if this is too long to read, but a lot of things are unclear to me and i really don‚Äôt know what to do.

i‚Äôm 17 and the oldest of 5 kids. my parents are married and usually never fight, so i‚Äôve always admired their relationship. about two months ago my mom asked me to help her delete some stuff off her phone as she was running out of storage. when I unlocked the phone, this email account was open and all messages had dates as subjects. I never should‚Äôve clicked on them but I just did. every single email had several attachments, screenshots of different conversations between my dad and other women. most of them where he was clearly flirting with them, others where they talked trash about my mom saying she ‚Äúis always with the kids‚Äù and ‚Äúalways complains‚Äù, and even some sexting conversations that I thankfully did not open.

anyway, i had about three weeks where all i could think about were those emails and i cried almost every single day. about a month ago, my mom bought a new phone and she asked me to help her clear her notes and files so she could transfer the things she needed only. when cleaning her notes app i noticed that apart from the regular supermarket lists and stuff, she used them as a diary of some sort, where she wrote messages as if they were directed to my dad (the most recent ones from july-aug from this year).

basically she just wrote long descriptions of everything she found out, saying how she felt and even describing how tired she is of taking care of my siblings and i every single day and having to live by his empty promises of changing. i‚Äôm trying to make this as short as i can, but lets just say i also found out he got with one of his students when he was a teacher a few years ago, and had been consistently sending money to many of those women. other disgusting things were written and mentioned, but i really had it when i read that in one of the notes she said something along the lines of her not even realizing where he hit her. 

finding out my dad was this completely different person still feels like someone stabbed me. i feel so so bad for my mom and i just don‚Äôt know how to help her. one note specifically she wrote saying how she had been thinking about how she would manage with us 5 by herself. and another one saying how she stays with him because he promised her to change, and how she is afraid to leave him, because she loves him, because all income comes from him, and because he has a really good reputation around town.

i keep thinking about the way i always looked up to him and how he turned out to be this way. it really hurts when i think about how i like the music i like because he likes it, i like cars because he does, i watch and talk sports with him, and i‚Äôve always taken pride in calling him my father. and it feels wrong to be worrying about what i feel when my mom has been through all of this. i don‚Äôt feel safe here anymore, i can barely sleep at night knowing what he‚Äôs done and worrying for my mom. i worry for my siblings and i want to keep them away from this so bad.

i‚Äôm so sorry this post is such a mess but i just can‚Äôt do it anymore, i‚Äôve wanted to talked to my mom about it because that seems to be my only option, but her mom (my grandma) has been struggling with health issues and we think she may pass soon, so i don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs the right moment to tell her, she is stressed enough and me telling her i know all of this will only worry her more. i don‚Äôt have any other option because talking to anyone i know means they know my dad, and i don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs appropriate to talk about anything before i talk about it with my mom, after all she‚Äôs been keeping it a secret for years apparently. i fully respect what my mom wants, but i would want her to leave my dad, and even if i do get that its hard because she loves him more than anything, i feel she is putting not only herself but me and my siblings in danger by staying. i feel it‚Äôs also important to mention that my dad is a heavy drinker and while he doesn‚Äôt drink that much daily, he has had some specific moments where it has been an issue.

i‚Äôve thought about it ever since i found out and decided that i will do whatever it takes to keep my siblings safe, even if it means i‚Äôll eventually have to move out and have them live with me. also, doing anything about the situation would mean we have to discuss the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù with them, and i don‚Äôt know if i want them to know what kind of person my dad really is. it hurt enough when i found out and its not something i want them to go through.

ps. I want to add that on my sister‚Äôs birthday this year a few months ago (april i think) she had a party, and when all her friends were leaving I heard my parents fighting. the yelling was pretty loud and they usually never fight (and if they do they never yell like that), my sister had to ask her friends to go on a walk around the neighborhood with her so they didn‚Äôt hear the fight and their yelling eventually ended on what I thought was a loud thud noise against some furniture. i asked my mom about it some time later that month but she said nothing happened. obviously after all of this i can only assume he hit her, but i‚Äôm not sure if this is what she was talking about in that note or if he‚Äôs done it again.

another ps. sorry for any mistakes, english is not my first language.",2021-11-09 07:11:12,2025-03-17 03:33:57,domestic violence
prdqkt,Fled domestic violence and living in a tent and need advice,throwawayguuurl,5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/prdqkt/fled_domestic_violence_and_living_in_a_tent_and/,"As the title says, I've fled domestic violence and I'm going to be living in a tent. It will sound weird but the only other place I had to go was a friend of my ex's mom. Unfortunately he has dementia and he yells at me constantly and tries to grope me. In fact he already tried to hold me down once. I'm disabled and I'm worried that if I stay there he's going to end up raping me because I can't fight him off. He's basically said let it happen because I'm not hurting you.

I know it's going to sound like I'm being entitled but he flips on the lights and the TV in the middle of the night and I can't sleep. I've already applied for disability but that's the process and I've applied for housing but none of the places are taking applications due to covid and they said that even when they do open back up which they don't even know when that will be, there's a six-month wait. I just can't live this way anymore. I didn't leave my abuser just to have to deal with this so I would honestly rather just being a tent.

I've already called The Domestic Violence Shelter here and they are full to capacity. I'm in Jacksonville Florida and I just need advice on where to pitch this thing where nobody will mess with me especially the cops. I don't want to end up in jail due to fleeing domestic violence. Any advice is appreciated.",2021-09-19 18:40:44,2025-03-17 03:33:58,domestic violence
lnxygi,Domestic Violence Survivor - Best Friend Currently Dating an Abuser - Advice please,diff4544,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/lnxygi/domestic_violence_survivor_best_friend_currently/,"Hey everyone!

Ive been a long time reader - first time poster. I really need an opinion from people i dont know about my current situation.

My friend and I have known each other for about 5 years. We have been inseparable (not necessarily in the sense of seeing each other every day etc) but we were very close emotionally and mentally. We could tell each other anything etc.

For background: i was in an incredibly violent domestic violence situation approx 6+ years ago, it lasted for about 5 years. It was extreme. There were a few times where my abuser almost killed me. I feared for my life when i was finally able to break away - and i had extreme PTSD and anxiety because of this relationship - which i received therapy for (still am in therapy and also on medication). My life has done a complete 180 - i am very healthy, happy, almost finished with my degree. im in a very healthy and loving relationship.

My friend a handful of months ago met this man and at first i was beyond excited and happy for her. Suddenly and very quickly things took a turn. It started very subtle - but as a domestic violence survivor - many of us can spot these signs quicker than most. He would say things to her like: you are so cute - i can see that the wheels are turning and no ones home its fun to watch. Now, most people wouldn't freak out over it nor did i, but i did warn her: this isnt something necessarily nice and maybe you should keep an eye on it. She stated she thought it was cute - okay, i disagree but moving on. She set up boundaries very respectfully and quickly with him: im not going to be ready for sex for x amount of time nothing to do with you this is just my thing etc. He went on to say: im really fucking offended that you would think that im just trying to fuck you. I explained: hes trying to guilt you into sex - dont ever apologize to someone for putting up a boundary for yourself. She apologized to him - said she didnt think hed take it personally. (I explained there was no reason for him to - she disagreed). She goes to his house for the first time approx date 3-4 they mess around she explains im not ready to go all the way - he asked her about 5 times to have sex with him - She kept having to say no - i stated it was unacceptable behavior and urged her to get a reality check - she said she essentially thinks its cute that hes so into her - and that he: ""has a chip on his shoulder but she finds it really sweet"" Basically, this man has forced her to have sex with him and that is a truth that she is not ready or willing to face.

\*\* Also have begun to notice: we are both college students - she has let her schooling slip severely to spend time with him which is a giant red flag to me - for example they went on a trip for valentines weekend - and she did none of her work which is very unlike her and now shes behind and struggling in her classes\*\*

The issue between us: she asked me for my opinion on this guy and i stated that i didnt like him at all, he gave me the creeps, i dont think hes a good person, i have a horrible feeling about him etc. Immediately she started to attack me, my boyfriend, my relationship etc. So it created a wedge between us and i met her to discuss it in person: dont ever disrespect me again; i will support you but i dont like him. She smiled and nodded and ever since there has been an extreme amount of tension and animosity most of which i could ignore until recently she started in with the topic of abusive relationships. Celebrity men being outed as abusers has been the topic of focus - a topic we once saw eye to eye on and now shes got this attitude of: i think its weird that you dont feel sorry for these men, i mean if they had a horrible childhood thats a good excuse to me for why they end up the way they did. etc. things to just really seemingly get under my skin and trigger me.

I have begun to get really triggered and have flashbacks about my abuse that took years of therapy for me to work through. I expressed this to her - and stated while i dont blame him; he is bringing out a part of her that is the worst part of her and ultimately SHE is doing these things to me and i need them to stop. She stated that she disagreed with everything i said, stuck up for him essentially (was not expecting her not to for the record) and when on to say: honestly, i forget half the time that youre a domestic violence survivor - my bad.

I really love her like a sister - we have been friends as i said for years and our children are growing up together (we each have a child) and im worried for her - i know that i cant control her life or decisions no matter how clearly i can see them and she cannot - but i can control my own life. I recognize that her behavior is toxic and triggering for me - but i cant help feel this sense of guilt for wanting to turn my back on her. I dont really want to do that at all. When i was with my abuser a lot of people did it to me and i did understand why and continue to but it hurt and it was a very lonely place to be. But for my own mental health - i cannot be in the presence of a man like this nor is it easy for me to watch my friend change for a man like this. I guess i wanted to share my story and see what you guys would do in this situation? Thank you in advance.",2021-02-20 03:20:33,2025-03-17 03:33:59,domestic violence

I was not expecting this at all considering he pled guilty based on the deal with the prosecutor. The judge decided it was ok for him to just get probation. 

Just as I knew he would, he reached out to me. I'm feeling ok about this now because I know what's going on, kind of where he is, and the mood he's in. Obviously, the system didn't care that he's out so in order to have an idea as to his whereabouts, I engaged.  These are our texts from this evening... I feel like he's saying what he thinks I want to hear. Thoughts? I don't want to speak with him/see him at all. ",2024-06-18 04:41:07,2025-03-17 03:34:01,domestic violence

It‚Äôs been interrupting my day and my time that I spend with my bf. The other night I decided to block his number bc it has started to affect how I show up in my relationships. He‚Äôs been obsessively texting me to see if I‚Äôve told anyone about what he did to me. It‚Äôs been two days since I‚Äôve blocked his number... he reached out to my good friend and asked ‚Äúhow my tumor was doing‚Äù to seem like a nice guy... while also trying to slyly ask if I had said anything to her about what happened between us. It‚Äôs been very excessive. I‚Äôm planning on filing legal work because he will not stop, but I‚Äôm worried how far he‚Äôs going to take this in the meantime. My new bf and I have been dating for about two months. He knows a little bit about how crazy my ex was and how he‚Äôs still been contacting me... but I don‚Äôt think he knows how to deal with it. He hoped that after I blocked him it would all blow over. If anything it‚Äôs getting worse. He knows where I go to school and I am concerned that he will try to contact my bf or show up at my door.

He‚Äôs been trying to twist that story and while I know that my bf wouldn‚Äôt doubt me bc my friends have all witnessed my ex‚Äôs crazy making, I am not ready to tell him about my parents. He‚Äôs also been trying to say that my rape last year was me cheating on him (even though a. It was rape b. We were broken up. Also a reason why we got back together at one point). I tried to commit suicide a week later and I tested positive for ketamine. I did a rape kit that I‚Äôve kept at a facility for several months now. I‚Äôve been in therapy through a sexual assault center. I have legal proof of all of these things.

Currently he just knows about my ex and that I‚Äôm partially in therapy for trauma from him and for my health issues. It‚Äôs been two months. I don‚Äôt think I should have to throw that into the mix. I‚Äôd like for him to get to know me for me. What can I do in the present moment? What should I do as safety precautions? I‚Äôd like for the current moment to feel safe and normal.

heihef,Life after Domestic Violence,cafetero7,4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/heihef/life_after_domestic_violence/,"Hello all, I hope you have the time and patience to help me. I know when it comes to abusive relationships most people think of a man doing harm to a woman, which is unfortunately true. In my case it is the other way around. I wanted to get some advice on how those who have experienced mental/emotional/physical abuse have dealt with or moved forward from these experiences. What have you learned that has helped you? It would really help to hear from men who have gone through this, but advice from anyone would be very appreciated.

Just to give a backstory, I was in a toxic and abusive relationship for 2 1/2 years and am currently going through a divorce. We lived with each other for 7 months after the breakup, and it was a very unhealthy environment. My ex-wife was emotionally, mentally and physically abusive. She was a jealous person, would get me upset on purpose to get reactions out of me, had hit me multiple times on different occasions leaving me with bruises on my body, and has done many other things. I never hit her back or laid my hands on her and always made sure that I respected her physical being. She has falsely accused me of shoving her before I moved out and even threatened to call the cops on me. That was a devastating moment and felt betrayed. I didn‚Äôt even recognize her anymore. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have made my mistakes. This was my first serious relationship and I blame myself for getting sucked into the cycle of emotional abuse because I thought I knew better. I let myself become emotionally and mentally abusive. There were times when I wasn‚Äôt considerate of her feelings and have said things to her that were disrespectful. I realize my mistakes and am working to make sure they don‚Äôt happen again. I still don‚Äôt think I deserved the kind of agonizing bullshit she put me through. How can someone say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the love of my life‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the best man I‚Äôve ever been with‚Äù, but yet treat you like crap? How can they call you a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù when you have always put them first? Of course there were good moments, but the bad outweighs the good. I‚Äôm sorry for rambling, I‚Äôm just trying to find myself again and learn more ways on how to deal with this trauma throughout my life. I am currently in therapy and it has helped a lot. But I feel like connecting with those who have experienced similar traumatic events will be just as helpful, if not more.",2020-06-23 17:06:00,2025-03-17 03:34:07,domestic violence
1giacvs,This will haunt me for some time.  She tried to start over. She‚Äôs gone now. ,blacklightviolet,164,57,https://i.redd.it/l7jtf4kiwkyd1.jpeg,"If you are contemplating ending an abusive relationship, please don‚Äôt wait too long to leave. 
Please take every possible step to protect yourself before you end the relationship. 

This is Angie. I knew Angie. She was sweet and kind. 

Her soon to be ex-husband Jimmie Ledbetter, Jr. **was an advocate for the prevention of domestic violence.** Jimmie had organized domestic violence meetings, where he also spoke.¬†

According to [this article](https://www.keloland.com/news/domestic-violence-survivor-shares-her-story/) from 2018, Jimmie Ledbetter of Sioux Falls had said:

*‚ÄùI can‚Äôt stop it, but hopefully I can slow it down somehow by reaching just one person‚Ä¶‚Äù*

*‚ÄùI would like to see the courts be stiffer when you see the abuse happen. Women are losing their faith with the courts,‚Äù* Ledbetter had said.

According to police reports, Angie had recently filed for divorce Jimmie on the grounds of irreconcilable differences, and cited extreme cruelty in her petition. 

Court documents say Ledbetter was the last person to see Angie alive. The Sioux Falls man has now been charged with homicide in the death of his wife.

Last Sunday, on October 27th, at about 2am, her soon-to be ex husband Jimmie showed up in Angie‚Äôs bedroom and scared her. 

Angie then changed the locks and the passcode to the garage. 

The next day, on Monday, October 28th, surveillance footage from her neighbors cameras showed her soon to-be-ex entering the home at 3:30pm. 

Screams were heard at 5:30pm. 

Jimmie Ledbetter was then seen exiting through the garage door at 5:45pm, leaving it open.

Previous calls had been dispatched to the same address.

Prior to his arrest, Jimmie Ledbetter had created a GoFundMe to raise money for burial services. Some of the posts on his FB page seem a bit more ominous in this context, now.

The timeline of events has me wondering if this was punishment for filing for divorce and speaking up.

What also stands out to me is how quickly this happened.

Even if Angie had filed for a protection order immediately first thing on Monday morning after Jimmie had showed up in her bedroom and scared her, it still might not have stopped her from being murdered. 

The act of ending it is *the* most dangerous time for those who are contemplating departing a domestic violence situation. I don‚Äôt know when Jimmie received those divorce papers but it seems things may have escalated in intensity with the finality of the situation in writing. 

*It can happen this fast. You just never know how much time you have left. There may have been a dozen fights before this one, there may have been two dozen attempts to leave.*

On his birthday, on his FB page he had stated: ‚ÄúMost men won't see age 85! Sad thing to think about but true. So get busy living or get busy dying! Make that special someone feel your immediate intentions. Have those meaningful talks with your children! Once your time has expired you can't rewind what God has set in motion. **So to Angie Ledbetter your going to get the best of what's left of me‚Ä¶**

That promise seems more ominous now that I am re-reading it again.

1i58try,My partner tried to kill me,Claire274,67,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1i58try/my_partner_tried_to_kill_me/,"This story is probably a year long. But the main part started in October when I first called the police. Me (f29) and him (m43) had a toxic habit of arguing after drinking. He would typically lock me in a room and take my phone. In October I changed my passcode and updated Siri. I used hey siri to call police in October when he started getting violent. He was scrambling to grab my phone so I was able to run to a neighbours

He broke bail 3x, had a dvpn (domestic violence protection notice) served and was found breaching that 3x

On new years I met with him at a hotel. He started getting verbally abusive again, telling me he couldn‚Äôt wait until the day I hung myself, how I would never have children because I‚Äôd ruined myself etc. I packed my bags and said I think it‚Äôs best if I leave for tonight. He blocked the door and started getting physically aggressive. I told him if he didn‚Äôt let me leave, I would scream. 
He didn‚Äôt let me leave. So I screamed. So he put both his hands around my neck and beat my head into the wall. I used my fists to pound on the wall so he had to take a hand off my neck to pin my hands down. So I tried screaming for help again. He shoved his entire arm down the back of my throat so I was gagging and choking, he told me it couldn‚Äôt be that bad because I used to be bullock so I should shut up and take it. 
He alternated between choking and covering my mouth for about half an hour. When he covered my mouth he also pinched my nose so I couldn‚Äôt breathe. He shoved his hand down my throat again and that time, his hand came out covered in blood. He tore my left tonsil in 2 pieces, I didn‚Äôt realise at the time but he did some serious damage to my throat and mouth. 
Eventually the hotel night manager, an assistant and security guard used a master key to get into the room and at that point he had me in the bed, one hand choking me and the other hand holding down both my wrists. He was surprised by the interruption and got off me, I grabbed my things and the manager took me to an admin office while the security guard stayed with him until police arrived

iof61y,In a domestic violence shelter but frustrated because they seem to pick and choose who to help and who they won't.,gothmommy13,6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/iof61y/in_a_domestic_violence_shelter_but_frustrated/,"I've been here for about 6 weeks which is the time frame they give you to get yourself together before your exit date. I've asked about an extension a couple of times and was told that it should be ok but that I need to be thinking about a job and apartment. I've been so busy with other stuff they've made me do I haven't had time. I also already work so it's like my advocate isn't paying attention. It's ultimately up to the director whether I get the extension or not and I have proof of what I've been doing but it's like they don't care.

I went and got the restraining order that they forced me to get which has now left me without the option of being able to go back to my ex's house if I had to for obvious reasons. I'm on a waiting list for housing since I'm low income and my son is on the waiting list for daycare and tbh I'm a little pissed because my advocate said they have a notary and she was gone the week that I had to get the restraining order then the next week she didn't have her stamp with her. I had to pay out of pocket for cabs to get back and forth and to pay to have the documents for the restraining order notorized after my advocate told me she would tell the people in the hotline room to approve it. They've always told me they can't. I also apparently qualify for relocation money but apparently your advocate is supposed to file for that and hasn't. 

I just feel like what was the point of me even coming here if they're just going to kick me out without giving me enough time even though they know some things have slowed down and even stopped due to Covid?! Yet there's some people here who have been here for 8 months or longer who do nothing but sit around all day doing nothing and don't even watch their kids. What am I supposed to do? I can't be on the streets with a baby! They should know as a domestic violence shelter that some people like me are starting completely over and 6 weeks isn't enough time. I feel like they could be better trained. No compassion whatsoever. I've told them some shelters aren't even taking in due to Covid which is the truth. Again, they don't care then they wonder why some victims return to their abusers.

I'm just really fed up because I'm not made of money and they know this. Also, they should know that a lot of victims come in with literally no money and no job because financial abuse is pretty common in abusive relationships. I just don't see how they think 6 weeks should be enough time especially in a pandemic. That's why I say it seems like they pick and choose who to help and who they basically tell we don't care, your time is up, get out. 

I'm a good resident. I don't cause trouble and I stay to myself. I've even shown my advocate proof that I'm working on bettering my situation and they're still acting like they want me out this week! I just don't see how they can show favoritism. I'm terrified of what will happen to me. I'll be forced to bring my son back to his father's house, also my abuser, because he lives with his parents. I'm not going to walk the streets with a baby. I'm just really pissed right now because I could see if I was sitting around on my ass not trying to get anything done but I've been running around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to get things done. This isn't right.

Edit: I got an extension and I have an appointment Monday to do an intake for rapid rehousing. It's good but I still feel like the original post is accurate. It seems like if things don't happen in their time frame, they treat you like you're not doing anything. I resented how they were like well you should've had all this done by now and acted like I was being lazy because it wasn't done when they wanted it to be. Having a child makes things harder and take longer and they should realize this.",2020-09-07 20:16:42,2025-03-17 03:34:12,domestic violence
c0ep1s,VENT: I think it's sad how some people think that men can't be victims of domestic violence. I just got into a debate with someone who tried to say that men cannot be victims and that the abuse against them is not as serious as the abuse against women.,Babyhandgrenade,13,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/c0ep1s/vent_i_think_its_sad_how_some_people_think_that/,"I know I shouldn't have gotten as upset as I did but I couldn't help myself. She actually said men can be victims but they're not. She said violence against women is much more serious and the people in that other thread were making light of abuse against women and no one was doing anything of the sort. When I are pointed out where she had contradicted herself several times and asked her where the attitude was coming from she got very angry with me and called me a drama queen.

She said it was only a discussion and I told her no it was no longer just a discussion because she had turned it into a debate. I pointed out to her that no one had said that abuse against women was and he was serious than abuse against men and she accused me of not caring about abuse against women. I told her that she needed to educate herself better and that she had seriously just contradicted herself not once but about four times.

She proceeded to call me all kinds of names and tell me that again I was being a drama queen and told me to quote check myself. It's so funny how a narcissist will out themselves even through text. It's kind of funny how you can pick them out even through text just because you've had to deal with them. When you prove them wrong in any kind of way they become very angry. 

I told her that I was done having the discussion and blocked her. Like I said, I know I shouldn't have gotten that upset about it but after you've been through abuse and after you've also had a brother who was an abuse Survivor, it just kind of messes with you.

People who are emotionally invested in being right usually have low self-esteem and have to be right all the time. They are right even when they're not if that makes any sense. They are so immature that to them, admitting to being wrong is admitting to being a dumbass. You can be wrong without being stupid but some people don't see it that way because they have to be right and perfect all the time and think everyone should treat them as such.

 Those people are called narcissist. If you've ever have the unfortunate experience of dealing with one like I have than I feel for you. It's exhausting. I wanted to say to her chill out, it's not that serious but I just told her that I was done having the conversation. It just frustrates me when all you do is gently point out where someone was wrong so that they can learn and they get all bent out of shape.

1c0r0bo,"DV Survivor said my abuse ""isn't that bad"". Now I'm not sure what to do.",steakcakewine,64,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1c0r0bo/dv_survivor_said_my_abuse_isnt_that_bad_now_im/,"I just got out of a lunch meeting with a woman I was introduced to and recommended I speak with from a friend to get some support and counsel during this process. I'm a little flustered, so sorry if this sounds sporadic, but I just needed to vent.

She's in her 50's (I'm in my 30's) and has been out of a very abusive DV relationship for about 10 years now. We were having a really lovely time at first, she shared her story and then asked me about mine. Her story is so incredible, and she dealt with a lot of physical violence that landed her in the hospital. I told her out the gate that I have never been physically hit, that mine is more punched walls, throwing things, screaming, name-calling, gaslighting, control of my location, extreme jealousy, and much more psychological and emotional abuse. His worst moments have also historically been far-between, usually once a year or so. As I was talking and I mentioned I was in a headspace of preparing to leave, which would be fairly easy as we don't have any shared debt or finances, no kids, and both work.

After I'd mentioned that, she shifted the conversation with ""Well, it's not every day, so that's not that bad. Are you wanting to leave because it's easy to?""

The question kind of threw me. I hadn't thought about it that way, so I said ""I guess I don't know.""

Her response was ""If you really want things to work, you have to wait to see if he's going to do anything. If you don't, isn't that a cop-out? At least he's trying.""

I made the statement that his ""trying"" has really just been words so far, not much action. She said ""Action takes time, and you haven't really given it yet. If it isn't all that bad, you could wait to see if he backs up what he says."" She then went on to talk about how if her husband had been willing to try and has stopped his aggression, she would've stayed and waited to see.

I left a bit after that, it honestly shot my anxiety through the roof. I felt pretty confident about my choice, but now hearing from her I feel conflicted and confused. I also feel like that goes against everything that hard data shows. I obviously did not have it nearly as horrifically bad as she did, but I wasn't expecting that kind of response, although I think it was coming out of a place of caring, it really got to me. I cried all the way home.

Has anyone else dealt with this from a fellow survivor? Am I wrong in not having a desire to try harder?  I'm at a complete loss how to take this. She also wants to follow up with me at a later date. I vaguely pushed it off, but I honestly don't ever want to see her again.",2024-04-10 17:18:59,2025-03-17 03:35:20,survivor

1ijzm1e,"Concerning normalisation of dating much older men on social media - just my rambling as a survivor (cw: adult grooming, age gaps, catfishing)",moonlightnocturne,35,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ijzm1e/concerning_normalisation_of_dating_much_older_men/,"Hi, i just wanted to ask - is anybody else extremely concerned and/or triggered by all those viral age gap couples where the guy is like 50-60 and the woman is in her 20s, because I see those advertised to me all the time and as a survivor of adult grooming and catfishing by a man who was 48 and claimed to be 27 in order to seduce me, it's impossible for my brain to comprehend why on earth a guy older than 40 would ever choose to date someone over 10 years younger than himself. Just. *Why*. That could be your daughter.

I understand that in some cases age doesn't matter and ""it's two consenting adults"". But when I first found out that my ex (48M) lied to me about his age when we first met and I was still barely 24, I went through a long denial phase where I looked up age gaps and tried to convince myself that it's okay and ""not grooming because in my 20s I'm already an adult!"". I ignored my gut feelings, I told all of my friends that I think it's fine when middle aged people date young adults, that it's *hot* and so on. 

But now, after breaking up with him and starting my healing journey, my opinion turned very radical. I genuinely cannot understand how someone so young can ever seem like a fulfilling long-term partner to a middle aged person. (And I'm not talking about consensual hook-ups here, I'm talking about very serious and intense relationships that are meant to last.) I know that some older men are not abusers or a threat. However - my ex acted like he was the sweetest, most submissive and non-threatening feminist ally who ""never dated anyone that young before me"" and fell in love with me because it was fate and told me I'm ""mature for my age"" (additional context: I look young, I'm neurodivergent and LGBT, I stim in very childish looking ways and we had a language barrier due to which I DEFINITELY seemed like an innocent child to him when I struggled to communicate in his native language). And that man chose to deceive and date a 21 YEAR OLD right after I dumped him (thankfully I caught on very fast and managed to save them in time). Which just confirmed that I wasn't ""special"", I was just another name on his list.

I know that my trauma has had a lasting effect on my judgment and I may just be triggered / overreacting. But my point is - why are so many people normalising age gaps nowadays? Why are we saying it's ""okay as long as you're in your 20s""? I don't think it's ever okay for someone so much older to steal someone else's youth, even if it seems like it was the younger person who initiated it. Maybe my opinion is too radical now that I'm a survivor, but the whole ""milf/dilf"" seeking thing has become a trigger for me, because of how often it results in abuse and exploitation. It's different when you know from the very beginning and choose to date someone despite the age gap, it's different when you're on the same stage of life - but the thing is, why would it even be an attractive option to the older person unless they had some serious issues with themselves? Why would you date someone a generation below you? I can't even imagine dating anyone 5 years younger than me, let alone 20. I don't get it.",2025-02-07 16:53:47,2025-03-17 03:35:24,survivor

1imn4u6,"The ""support"" I received recently from the national hotline was disturbing and I feel other survivors deserve to know.",dvsurvivor92,42,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1imn4u6/the_support_i_received_recently_from_the_national/,"Ive posted in the past about how ive attempted over dozens of times to be connected to the national domestic violence hotline (US) for support and before literally just this month, I had only gotten through once. They were nice that time and helpful and provided resources and safety planning for me. Im not trying to say they should be defunded at all, Im sure they have help so many survivors, but I do feel the need to share my experiences.

My situation with my childrens father is escalating now alot more than ever before, he is threatening to ruin the life of me and my entire family if I leave him and has threatened to kill me and my pets, he found my resources from before and took them from me. My local shelter options are very limited and Im in a rural, isolated, extremely small town far from any big cities that would have access to more resources, so its not as simple as "" just reach out for support locally"". One my abusers close female friends works at the only shelter available to me within 50 miles. So this is why I was kindof been hoping for more options and potentially lesser known resources from the national hotline. 

The past month, Ive gotten connected to the national hotline three times which felt like a miracle considering last yr I couldnt get connected no matter how many times I tried to call. But I only was left to feel ignored, blamed, and treated like I didnteven matter one bit. 

The first time, the woman I spoke to sounded like a robot, unfeeling and uncaring and sounded like she was reading verbatim from sometype of script. A few of her replies to me didnt match my situation which made it feel scripted, like she kept saying ""you need to find healing and safety for sure"" when I talked about needing transportation resources or talking about the pain in my throat and neck from when he choked me out and slammed my head against a wall last week! She gave generic safety tips that didnt apply to me like, curl up in a ball and protect your head and neck area, when I had told her earlier in the call that Im disabled in a wheelchair and cant do certain movements to protect myself. and at various points, clearly muted herself and I wouldnt hear from her for several several seconds after I was done talking and she would come back and just say ""right right"" and continue with her cold unfeeling script of cold and blunt questions and statements that didnt even apply to me. At one point I heard her doing the dishes in the background and I asked for online support groups and she told me she didnt have none! I didnt feel heard at all and I told her I felt like Im going to die soon and didnt know what to do to protect my children because Im disabled and all she said was youre strong and Im sorry what your going through have you tried documenting the abuse in a journal. Wtf? 

The second time was a man who kept rushing me to answer a bunch of questions, urged me to share details of me sexual assault so that he could help me better when I didnt want to share, and also sounded like he was following a script, and we reached 25ish minutes and he told me he needed to now provide resources and move onto next caller. I felt so dismissed and he spent no time with me for emotional support or safety planning and he just said look at our website for safety tips. I even shared with him my bad experience from before and how I was hoping to have a better call this time and he just said oh you must have called a different place you must be thinking of another hotline not us, so I read the 8007997233 number from my phone log back to him and he said oh well that doesny sound like our hotline! Just made me feel blamed, which my abuser already does to me every day. I asked him to repeat a number because Im hard hard of hearing and he repeated it again really fast and quickly ended our call by saying stay safe and take care and didnt check that I had the number right! 

The third and FINAL TIME I am ever reaching out to this ""hotline"" I only spoke for about two minutes and she said ""we understand you have been calling this hotline and speaking to our agents dozens of times this week and you have been provided support and resources already for your situation"" and she said a few other things to basically dismiss me and insinuate Im a problematic repeat caller!!!! When I have only actually gotten connected to a live person in this hotline less than 5 times!! She said I can speak to you for five minutes only today and then she needs to give up the line or whatever to take other calls. I hung up and cried after. 

THIS is the help for us survivors out here. This hotline receives millions in funding and Im left feeling hopeless and completely ignored, dismissed, and even attacked. Im sure others have had great experiences and for that Im grateful for the hotline and not saying it should be taken down or defunded at all because im sure they do wonders for other people and thats great I'm happy for those people I guess Im not worth help or something about me maybe I don't come off friendly but its hard to be chipper and positive these days. I cant believe this is my experience with them. Somethings gotta be wrong with their training process the past year or something idk. The last woman I talked to told me to calm down when I shared details of my abuse and was crying only a little bit. How is that survivor focused or proper trauma training. My first call with them went so great that I had so much hope to have that again but oh well, Im glad at least for that one woman who was a godsend that day for me a year ago. 

I wanted to start this thread so others could share their experiences because I really feel its unacceptable! ",2025-02-11 01:36:13,2025-03-17 03:35:26,survivor

She said, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt women fight back?‚Äù I said I tried, but he‚Äôd get more threatening. She asked why I didn‚Äôt take a knife to bed and did that whole, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not victim blaming but-!‚Äù thing so many people do. Also, as per usual, she didn‚Äôt say, ‚Äúwhat a terrible guy!‚Äù and blame HIM. She blamed me. Why is it always the victim/survivor who gets the finger pointed at them?

Explaining the whole debacle brought back memories and feelings I pushed away years ago.
I‚Äôve been victim/survivor blamed so many times (even by family members) that it‚Äôs not surprising anymore. However it still is sad when you get blamed, especially if it‚Äôs someone you look up to. I still like this streamer and am not angry, just sad, disappointed, and depressed by her response. I‚Äôm working on a book to tell my story and raise awareness so hopefully people will see why the abused react the way they do. Hopefully this will make others better understand the fear and other complicated emotions that go with abusive relationships and help people to be more sympathetic.

1iw8r4j,"Family of DV survivors, how to mend the relationship?",Mediocre-Example-838,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iw8r4j/family_of_dv_survivors_how_to_mend_the/,"This question is both for family members who have or are working on their relationship with the survivor and also for survivors navigating the same. 

I (33non binary) have been navigating healing my relationship with my twin (33 f) after her 7 year abusive relationship.

My question is around the rupture that happens to the relationship between survivors & their support group/ family during DV situations.

The specific areas of rupture/impact that I've noticed are trust, control/boundaries (what are they what aren't they), navigating PTSD, blame feelings. I wonder if you all have noticed others.

My sister's abuser used all forms of abuse in varying degrees, most notably financial and emotional. Towards the end it got very violent and threatened bodily harm (totaled her car in front of her screaming at her, had a gun and threatened himself and her with it- so he didn't hit her but we were all rightly terrified).

She was with him and enduring this for 7 years. Throughout that time myself and my family tried to support her and her children. Over the years things escalated and my sister ended up being isolated and not feeling safe to share with us everything that was happening. This is where the rupture of trust started. She didn't trust us to not say something about the abusive behavior she was experiencing. We lost trust in her ability to tell us. We lost trust in her ability to make sound choices- namely a suitable partner.

It quickly became a horrible cycle. He would move their family further away from us isolating her, we would feel out of control and beg her to just leave him. I remember asking her if there was anywhere on earth he would suggest they move that she wouldn't follow him. Nope.

The boundaries rupture came in mostly towards the end while she was leaving him. He got increasingly violent and vile. Myself and my family felt completely out of control and out of ways to protect her.

I don't think my family understands boundaries well. Also, I don't know if you can set boundaries from a desperate panicked place, not sure. During the car/gun stuff we were hurling ultimatums framed as boundaries at her left and right. ""If you don't leave with your kids right now, I'm going to call the cops."" 
What a powerless feeling to threaten someone you love with something you don't want to do in a desperate attempt to make them protect themself. This also greatly impacted trust, on both sides.

Towards the end he started getting more and more violent (as she remained firm in her decision to be done). He started threatening myself and my mother and my little brother. He totaled her car with his, he had a gun. It was the scariest time in my life. I was so scared that he was going to kill her and the kids and I had her begging and screaming and crying for me to let her handle it and not call the cops. I still regret not calling even if he didn't kill them.

I feel really traumatized by that experience. Obviously it goes without saying that my sister is also traumatized. She's been out of the relationship for 2 years and sharing visitation. My family doesn't interact with her ex at all. 

I think where I'm struggling is integrating what I KNOW about abusive relationships - it takes several times to leave, survivors will often cover for the abuse and make excuses, survivors sometimes take out restraining orders and then immediately drop them. All of these happened. 

and I KNOW why and that it's common and what the psychology is behind it. And my nervous system and my body and yeah parts of my brain can't or don't want to accept that. 

There's part of me that's so mad at her. For giving him access to her in the first place and her children and our family. I blame her for choosing to keep her first pregnancy with him. I blame her for the fact that my nieces have to grow up with a scary dad. I blame her for my PTSD, years out I still can't put my phone on silent or DND. I still get panicked when she calls out of no where. For not seeking financial and housing support bc she would have to name their relationship as abusive. 

I think I'm struggling to accept the real impact of something that wasn't her fault. Are there parts I can ask her to hold responsibility around? 

We're all in therapy! Therapy isn't the same as hearing from others experiences. Please share if you have any insight! I know each situation is different, but I'm curious if anyone can relate. ",2025-02-23 12:09:29,2025-03-17 03:35:33,survivor

Who the hell has the energy to start yelling at 6am?? She yells at him too sometimes but 70% of it is from him, sometimes absolutely screaming at the top of his voice, stomping around the house like a toddler, slamming doors as hard as he can, pushing furniture over. It's a grown man having temper tantrums and it pisses me off so much, and obviously I am deeply concerned for the girl and their small dog.

It never sounds like the girl or the dog are physically harmed, but obviously I have no way of knowing. It would be obvious that I'm the one that called the police, and I'm scared of him retaliating. Then again, I feel awful for just minding my own business while this girl is suffering. A few times I have said loudly 'What the fuck was that??' to my boyfriend, hoping they'll hear it and realize it isn't okay, but then I thought that maybe pissing off the guy even more was a bad idea. I am just torn in different directions about what to do.

I run into her pretty often since we share the same front door, parking spaces, and trash bins, but we always just say hi and nothing else. The last few times she had such a big startle reflex that it broke my heart. I think next time I see her I'm going to say something, but I have no idea what. 'If you ever need an immediate place to get away from him you can come up to ours'? 'There is help available'? 'Hey are you okay?'?

Everyone's situation, personality, and needs are wildly different. Some might be offended that I'm sticking my nose into it, others might be grateful that I didn't just turn the other cheek. Picture me as your concerned upstairs neighbor, what would you want me to do?

You becoming better is not going to erase the need to abuse. So it doesn‚Äôt matter what you do.

This is what they have chosen you for. Not because they found something special in you. But because you are someone who passed their abuse filter and stayed with them. It is not about you. It is about them.

1fp7rws,Survivors - does it get better?,Icy_Hearing_248,9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1fp7rws/survivors_does_it_get_better/,"Hey, so I‚Äôm new here.  I‚Äôm so frustrated with myself for not being okay so I turned to google to try and make sense of everything.  

I‚Äôve had a read through and it seems a lot of you are still in the situations, trying to work out how to leave, or maybe hanging on to hope that things will change.  I‚Äôm sorry - it sucks.  It really sucks.  

When I read other people‚Äôs struggles I can‚Äôt help but focus on how lucky I am to have got away and had a ‚Äòclean‚Äô break without having to leave my support network.  

Here it goes, I was in an abusive relationship from the age of 19 to 32.  Had first baby at 21 married him at 22and second at 28.  Even in the first few months of being together there were red flags (I hate that phrase!).  He would lock me in his room and not let me leave, or get loud and hold me if I disagreed.  I still decided to have a child with him and get married.  

The abuse was never huge, a push, a slap, nothing ‚Äòserious‚Äô to begin with.  But by the time our son was 1 I had cut off all my friends and learned to keep quiet anytime he treated me badly.  There were times when I was sure we were better and I was happy, but then it would happen again.  By the end of our marriage I was a shell of whoever I once was.  He made all the decisions, took all of my money, I never went out other than to work or school things.  Otherwise I was to be home, cooking, cleaning, helping him with his business.  I literary could feel him sucking the life from me, but I was too scared to do anything.  And too proud to tell anyone, my family were clueless.  In the last year of our marriage he got so much worse.  I was already at the point where every day when his car would pull up I would be terrified.  Then one night he went out drinking and came home and beat me worse than he ever had, he told me he was going to kill me and I believed him.  Our neighbours called the police and when they came the next day he was still in a rage but I lied when they asked if I needed help.  I have no idea why.  I was terrified.  If I had have been brave that could have been the end of it.  

Do the next 9 months the state of fear I felt was uncontrollable.  If he went out at night I would sit up waiting for him to come in.  I would never sleep until he was sleeping.  Then it came to a head at a family event, he had a disagreement with someone there and when I said it would be better if we just left he hit me.  In front of everyone.  No more hiding.  There was a huge commotion but I left and went to my mums (where our kids were).  He turned up later and tried to kick the door down so we called the police, he was arrested and this time I was going to press charges and leave forever.  (I had left him a few times throughout our marriage, but always went back).  

The next three weeks were torture.  Me and the kids stayed with my parents.  He would turn up everywhere.  My parents were away one of the weekends and I slept on the floor so I could see the front door.  I went to stay with my sister to get away and try and get my head together so I could work out our next steps, we couldn‚Äôt stay with my mum forever.  

The day after I got there I got the news that he was wanted for SA on a teenager.  He was arrested the same day and remanded in prison.  He has been there ever since.  He would call and write all the time and I only actually worked up the courage to go no contact about 3 month ago.  

So in reality, I am so lucky.  I don‚Äôt need to worry about him turning up, causing any more problems, he will likely be deported so I won‚Äôt have to move away.  Literally a clean break - and I know so many of you will never get this.  But honestly, I don‚Äôt even feel like carrying on anymore (I will, I have two kids who I love more than anything) but I just can‚Äôt take this pain.  I thought I would feel liberated, and happy.  This is what I have always wanted, but I feel like a failure, like I don‚Äôt even know how to be a person anymore.  I don‚Äôt trust anyone.  I do try, but it feels impossible.  I still have nightmares, I still feel like he will just turn up one day.  I‚Äôm still terrified.  And I don‚Äôt know how to make it stop. 

So I guess I‚Äôm looking for hope.  How do you get past this bit?  I just want to feel normal again.  I hate myself for letting him make me feel like this.  I used to be fearless, confident and so positive, there was literally nothing I couldn‚Äôt face.  But now I don‚Äôt even want to try anymore.  I just feel broken. 

Thanks if you got this far!  For those of you still in abusive situations don‚Äôt let this put you off leaving.  Even as bad as I feel now, I could never go back.  Or put my kids back in that situation.  I just think I expect it to feel better than it does.  Leaving is 100% the thing that needs to be done.  They won‚Äôt change.

I know myself better and feel that I've grown enormously. I have more confidence in who I am and am even planning a solo trip to the Middle East.

Most of all I can now envision a future for myself where I'm self sufficient and not emotionally dependent on or a doormat for a man. I feel like I have a new sense of resilience and self reliance.

1e57a1z,I need of support right now.

I am so tired of doing this all alone.  Tonight, I need to go through financial documents proving financial abuse and send it to my lawyer before start of business tomorrow. My ex owes me $4000+ in daycare expenses alone and at least a couple thousand more in a variety of other expenses like the cell phone bill for example.  I normally love numbers and am one of those weird people that enjoys balancing a checkbook but this feels like the most impossible task in the world.  When will it feel like I am not just surviving day to day.
I have been dragging my feet for months on getting the information to the lawyer bc I know once it is sent, that within less than 24 hours my ex-husband will retaliate with whatever new disturbing emotional and verbal attacks and I just cannot handle it anymore. Yet, if I don't put the stuff together and send it to my lawyer, I'll never get my money back. I feel mentally and physically frozen. I need help right now but I don't have anyone that can come sit with me to help me do it and I did ask about five friends and of course no one is available last minute.  I'm tired of trying to explain to my non-abuse survivor friends why I cannot plan out ahead of time a scheduled time and date to do this type of stuff.  The reality is abuse incidents and post abuse trauma happens randomly at any given time and when I reach out is the earliest I was able to make you aware.  I‚Äôm sorry right now is inconvenient for your schedule. It‚Äôs not great for mine either. In fact, the email I read in two minutes is going to set me back at least one full day, l likely more.  And asking for help alone is so so difficult, and it is even more defeating when your support people are all unavailable.  
I was at work and I received an email from my lawyer and had to leave work immediately. I barely made it to the car before I burst into tears. I called my gf (who also is also abuse victim, different abuser) and currently out of town and she is helping me as much as she can from a distance. But it just sucks. How do you explain to a non-abuse victim friend that you are essentially in crisis having an emergency situation when what you are dealing with in any other circumstance would not cause you to go into complete meltdown mode and would certainly not require assistance?  I don't feel comfortable saying, hey um I know you have kids and don't understand really why this is an emergent issue, but it is and I need you to drop what you‚Äôre doing and come help me.   It feels selfish to ask this of them especially when I can tell they don't see what the big deal is.  And I'm tired of trying to explain the lasting effects of abuse to them and how it affects my abilities to complete certain tasks or that I need them with me just in case he calls or starts texting me awful things or just because I am currently having some sort PTSD response to this task and I am having a complete meltdown now. Sometimes I wish he had hit me too so I had physical proof on my person that could be put in a police report, or just so my friends could relate to the urgent fear I feel when I text them for help and request they come over asap. To be clear I am not serious about wishing physical violence on myself, but I don't know how to explain to them that feeling of terror while also knowing I need to still remain calm enough to parent and get some urgent task done which induces panic. Sometimes as an abuse survivor it is just not possible to function and it doesn‚Äôt matter how important the current responsibilities are and that is when I need them to come help or at least call me.  If I don't have another person with me, it takes me too long to recover and get my work done which leads to more issues. With my gf also being a abuse victim, I don't have to explain anything to her, she gets it and knows I just need her presence to feel safe so that I can be productive again. Why is this concept so freaking hard for non-abuse victims to understand? I‚Äôm exhausted and I need help. I would come right over and just bring my kids with me or call the babysitter and try to get someone to watch them. And the worst is many of my friends have done this for myself or others in the friend group when it was some sort of other emergency, but when it comes to abuse related help, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm inconveniencing them by even asking.   I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt feel that way, but I do because the answer is always, sorry I can‚Äôt come help last minute.",2024-07-17 02:42:09,2025-03-17 03:35:57,survivor

I have never felt so cold under a thousand layers.

And even though you were one of the few who was able to peel those back-

I have been frozen since;

Confused and unsure why I allowed you to see what was inside of me when my body tried to tell me that I was frosting over.

I should have listened to the icicles in my veins when they whispered 'run' into my delicate mind;

But my gentle heart wanted nothing more than to see your good before your bad.

I should have listened to the snowstorm screaming in my stomach when we first met;

Flashbacks of everyone who has done me wrong appeared on your lifeless face.

In those moments-

The ones where I was pneumonia-ridden and gasping for love,

I prioritized you over myself.

You had only been drowning yourself in wonderland and lying to me about the girls who claimed they would give you summer.

Before we met I was summer.

I was summer. 

Your winter rubbed off on me and I fell so hard into your snow that I was no longer my favorite season;

I had become the one I dreaded most.

I hated winter, except for how it looked on you. 

I do not blame you. 

I blame me, for giving away such a kind and valuable love to a boy who ripped out my heart with his bare, dirty hands and ran with it; laughing and singing his way to the next self-preserved woman to see what body parts of hers he could add to his collection of lies and abuse.

I no longer have energy to value myself or God;

Whom I used to care for more than anything-
Before that spooky night watching the airplane runway where the little girl in me fell in love with the number one person she was not supposed to. 

I refuse to be winter after she texted me from your phone;

But right now I am both hot and cold, unable to decipher between my good and bad parts.

I am sad. I am lost. I am confused.

But the one thing I care about most right now is how your new beautiful summer girl will shortly become the deep and dark winter which you will enforce upon her. 

The only thing I feel is for her.

A beautiful soul she must be-

Like I once was;

Standing vulnerably in line to have her heart shredded.‚Äù

I wrote this in 2016- specifically on the night he ghosted me and left the state for another woman. I had felt so relieved, but so hurt at the same time. I didn‚Äôt think too much into what I was writing, I just let my thoughts flow with my tears and fell asleep. 

Years later I discovered I still had this as a note in my phone, and finally realized what had actually happened to me: I had major stockholm syndrome, my indivuality had been eradicated, and I was codependent on a man who hurt me in all types of ways. He got me hooked on substances (a dual meaning for my ‚Äúwinter‚Äù references) despite knowing I never wanted to become a user after what happened to my mother. The entire relationship, my subconcious knew I was being abused but I didn‚Äôt want to come to terms with it. I needed the attention in whatever form it was presented to me. The day he left was the miracle that I never could admit to myself I needed.

I read it to myself every once in a while. It reminds me how it‚Äôs very easy for me to fall into codependency and ignore my own wellbeing when I start to fall for a new peson. I‚Äôve spent a long time cultivating a beautiful self love so that I don‚Äôt allow myself to tumble into another obvious ditch with bright red flags around it, just because the person already in the ditch tells me about their trauma or gives me the attention I‚Äôm so desperate for. 

It reminds me how I had the strength to overcome deep psychological manipulation and physical abuse all those years ago, and I never let it turn me into a bad person. I held on to my empathy and continued trying to be the best person I can be for myself. Now, I‚Äôm able to help others who‚Äôve gone through similar things. I‚Äôm so proud of myself for that and I never give myself enough credit.

Sorry if any of this is a bit vague, however I do hope there‚Äôs someone who reads this and can relate. Maybe someone will read this and find the courage to acknowledge it‚Äôs abuse, the courage to leave, or even the courage to start to heal.

I promise you it gets better. I promise you recovery is possible. Healing is hard but it‚Äôs necessary and worth it. Trust me. If you don‚Äôt want to talk about it-write about it- because your future recovered self will admire you and it‚Äôs the best fucking feeling.

uhk2gh,Mod Note Re: Posts About BPD,Ebbie45,1173,267,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/uhk2gh/mod_note_re_posts_about_bpd/,"Hello, there has always been a large number of comments in this sub about BPD, or Borderline Personality Disorder. Some comments are supportive, while many others are generalizing, derogatory, and stigmatizing. Moreover, after a recent post stating that individuals with personality disorders should be incarcerated or put down, it's far past time for a mod post on this subject.

BPD is an emotion dysregulation disorder that is commonly associated with unstable self-image and relationships. It is a mental illness that is often described by affected individuals as debilitating and extremely emotionally painful.

The majority of reported cases of BPD occur in women. While research on the causes and contributing factors to BPD is still mixed, some evidence suggests that experiences of abuse, trauma, neglect, and abandonment can be involved in the development of the disorder.

An increasing number of comments in this sub have involved ""diagnosing"" abusers described in posts with BPD, despite commenters lacking the clinical expertise to make such diagnoses. Many of these comments make inaccurate assumptions about BPD in such a manner that contributes to stigma against the disorder, and perpetuate the notion that all individuals with BPD are abusive. This is unequivocally false.

There are a large number of abuse *survivors* in this sub who have actually been diagnosed with BPD by experts. Comments that diagnose abusers with BPD or equate BPD to abuse perpetration do a disservice to every abuse survivor in this sub who has the disorder.

This is not a sub in which it is ever appropriate to encourage, condone, or contribute to any stigmatization against mental illnesses.

Understandably, BPD is a complex and often understudied disorder. It is also understandable that some individuals have experienced trauma while happening to be in a relationship with someone with BPD. That being said, this sub will not be a place that allows the generalization of all individuals with BPD.

Please be mindful of your comments moving forward. Please do not diagnose anyone with BPD. If you suspect that a commenter's partner has a mental illness, that is the area of expertise for a trained clinician. Remember who is present in our sub and remember that many abuse survivors have mental illnesses, and all of us are harmed if we reach a place where we equate mental illness to abuse.

Please take care of yourselves and each other.",2022-05-03 16:34:27,2025-03-17 03:36:09,survivor

We work in the same industry. I got away from the abuse and shut him out and he can‚Äôt stand that he cannot control me anymore. The abuse kept me shut down for a long time, I was a shell of a person. Slowly I‚Äôve gotten stronger and reclaimed joy in my life.

I‚Äôve been strong to a point and have managed to avoid face to face contact, but he is slowly encroaching into areas of my field where I‚Äôm highly involved (he never had anything to do with these areas the past). It has been several things, not a one off. I think it‚Äôs him testing the waters, but he‚Äôs also using it as an opportunity to try to control me in the professional setting.

I have a committee meeting coming up which I know he‚Äôll be attending. I‚Äôve been on this committee for years and he has never been involved before. He told someone who he know would tell me he‚Äôs coming, so I think he‚Äôs trying to intimidate me into not attending - which is what the old me would have done. But I want to attend this meeting because it‚Äôs an area I‚Äôm passionate about, and I don‚Äôt want to let him control my life.

I have so much fear about him being there. I also have a fear he will try to join the committee as it will be a way to have ongoing contact with me.

I am extremely frightened. I feel sick just thinking about being in his presence. He‚Äôs very cunning. If he has an opportunity to blindside me he will. I need to make a plan not only to keep myself safe, but to make sure I can have a productive meeting and flourish doing what I love, even if he tries to cut me down. At this meeting I want to put forward my nomination for the ongoing chair of this committee and he might undermine me.

I hate that I have to think like this, but at the moment I‚Äôm not strong enough to know that I will be ok in the meeting. I‚Äôm using this as an opportunity to make a plan so that I can still go to my meeting and be involved because it‚Äôs what I want to do for myself. It‚Äôs also an important step in my healing journey. He‚Äôs going to try to hold power over me. So this is a chance for me to hold my power

Survivors, could you help me think about actions I can take here to prepare and protect myself?

Ideas I had:
- I will reach out to as many work friends as I can to attend with me. This way I won‚Äôt be alone as I enter and leave the building or go to the bathroom. But I also will have allies to help with the discussion if I am feeling overwhelmed, also they could help to vote for me as chair.
- I have a feeling my ex will try to stack the committee and take over the agenda, he‚Äôs good at using people to do his bidding for him. So I need to anticipate this and be a step ahead. Any other ideas of what I can do?
- I will think about how I want to come across. This is work so I think being professional and extremely calm will be important, even if he pushes my buttons. Should I even acknowledge him? Part of me thinks he‚Äôd have the shock of his life if I calmly addressed him during group discussion. Or is it better I don‚Äôt acknowledge him at all? Head extremely narcissistic so perhaps the greyrock method and being as boring as possible would be better.
- I think I‚Äôll print a few of my reports and bring them to the committee, it‚Äôs good background and will help put me forward in a professional light. It also gives me something physical to refer to if I have trouble collecting my thoughts.

Any other ideas?

This is coming from a burner account, but I‚Äôm always so grateful for this support community here. Thankyou all",2023-11-04 08:57:36,2025-03-17 03:36:16,survivor

Recently published an episode on emotional abuse, where a doctor goes over the warning signs that someone will be emotionally abusive, strategies to escape from an abusive relationship, and more.

a year ago i (22f) dated a guy i met off of tinder for three months. we were both 21, and i was in my junior year of college. beforehand i had never been in a committed relationship due to social withdrawal from childhood sexual abuse and only being in short term situationships or hookups. this is a chronological list of this guys behavior:

- every single day he wanted sex and made me feel guilty when i didnt want to

- we got into the relationship within a week of seeing each other and not even into the first week he was already pressuring me into sex

- one of the main things was he was so pushy about sex and anything affectionate we did always had to lead to sex on his part. cuddle in bed? has to lead to sex. take a bath together? sex. always sneaky about it and always repeatedly asking me. making me feel like i was easy and thats all

*and* before all of this i was sexually assaulted twice by two different guys that same year i got together with this dude, and during the course of our relationship i was just starting to process the trauma of being assaulted.

- he made up a story of a ""recent"" ex cheated on him and how hes ""always been cheated on"" in relationships as an excuse to pressure me into sex with him. he would constantly change the timeline of when he dated this person. 

- towards the end of the second month of us dating i became more distant because of all of the pressure he put on me for sex and physical affection. that same year when we got into a relationship i had been sexually assaulted twice. he clearly noticed and became more awful towards me. 

- when we took a trip a state over, when i didnt want to have shower sex with him (it wasnt even supposed to be a sexual moment i literally just wanted to shower!!!) and got out of said shower he later came into the room, he threw a pillow really hard in my direction and angrily told me about how he doesnt get what he wants. 

- he also hit me (it was light tapping) twice in the back when i turned over away from him when we were sleeping because at this point he was starting to force physical affection too

- the stress of him constantly accusing me of not loving him enough or being faithful to him caused me to have a horrible asthma attack 

- found out he used to say the n-word in high school (we are both white) after i made him kick out his also white friend for saying it. this was the final straw for me and i had made my decision to break up with him then and there, but i waited another weekend to actually confront him. 

- the day we broke up and i confronted him on his past racist behavior, he did not apologize and made excuses for his friend. i laid it all out and told him that he was no different than the people who abused me before. i said something about, to make him mad, how i can finally text all those guys he was so worried about me cheating on him with (there weren't any) and he got so angry with me that he slammed things off of his desk, near where i was sitting and near where his cats were, and went upstairs and started throwing things around and knocking things over. i remember backing into a corner and having to de-escalate his anger.

the aftermath:

- i lost all of my memory from anytime before june 2022 and after that, i can barely remember a single thing that happens to me from a span of a week. 

- my work ethic became terrible and my adhd and social anxiety worsened

- i barely made it through the rest of college

- shortly after breaking up with him, i had lost nearly all of the few friends i had made in college during covid due to the fact that i told them i left an abusive relationship

- i am even MORE socially isolated and defensive around others than before because of it, hurting my career prospects

- i feel like i am bullied by strangers, coworkers, and friends everywhere i go. i hate going out in public. everything triggers me.

- loud popping and slamming sounds bother me even more now than before

i feel like im overreacting and exaggerating what happened because i keep thinking that i just managed to escape a really shitty guy. but that moment when he was slamming things around me and his cats scared the shit out of me. i genuinely think that if i stayed he would have punched me. this has affected my life in so many awful ways it is really hard to stay motivated to live. i am crying as i write this.",2023-10-17 06:51:04,2025-03-17 03:36:25,survivor

16pzkph,Had to withdraw from DV survivor therapy program to accommodate the abuser who put me in the situation I need therapy for!,Ok-Range5086,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/16pzkph/had_to_withdraw_from_dv_survivor_therapy_program/,"Orders regarding parenting time were given two weeks ago. I found and arranged all the paperwork for agency supervised visits at the end of August. Abuser dragged his feet. He has agency supervised visitation for Wednesdays and Saturdays. My attorney emails his attorney every couple days asking for updates on if he even did ibis intake interview let alone schedule a visit. They ignore or all communication and never inform us that they will not make the visit per the orders. 
I push hard today for my attorney to demand answers because, I find out he is skipping the supervised visitation part of the orders and just getting the anger management portion of this step in the progressive parenting plan done- per the orders, ones he‚Äôs done with classes visits no longer have to be supervised. 
He lied to my attorney claiming this morning that the intake interview was done and that the agency is asking for too much information that is difficult for him to provide as the reason for delay. (The agency confirmed that he didn‚Äôt have the intake done as of yesterday and that the moment he finishes the interview it‚Äôs their policy to alert the coparent.) 
A few hours later after lunch the agency emails me that he finished his interview and that they have to comply with orders that state two visits a week, and since their week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday, would a agree to not only the ordered 10-12 block on Saturday, but also on Sunday. 

After some back and forth, it was clear, if I didn‚Äôt cancel my appointment for a domestic violence survivor group program (I was wait listed and found out at 6am today I got the opening to start on Sunday) then I would be noncompliant with the court orders. 

So this guy takes an axe to his family, terrorizes us to the point we leave and are homeless, demands in court for equal parenting time, cries that he hasn‚Äôt seen his kid since I left months ago (he has seen via zoom in a supervised virtual call I set up since June and he finally agreed to start beginning September), get orders for visitation, goes radio silent, then all of a sudden we have to drop everything for him?!

I keep every Wednesday and Saturday wide open for time flexibility. I offer to change the kids class schedule, I do everything for him to just see his kid, and nothing. Now he finally does something and it has to be the exact same time as my therapy?!

The irony of my abuser forcing me to drop the therapy for the ptsd his domestic violence caused so he can randomly see his kid only because I am the only one advocating for his relationship with my child. And, if I dare say no because it‚Äôs now Friday evening 6PM and this is virtually no notice, then I am the one not following the orders. 

I left the abuser but I can‚Äôt seem to get away from the controlling abuse. I stopped him from hurting me in person, but now he can prevent me from getting better. I don‚Äôt think there is a word to describe how I feel about him.",2023-09-23 09:01:50,2025-03-17 03:36:28,survivor

As it was, that relationship broke me and I'm still healing from it.",throwaways-lot,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/165uoh4/i_was_in_an_emotionally_abusive_relationship_as_a/,"Hi folks. I wish I could be reaching out under better circumstances, as I'm sure there are a lot of wonderful people on here. I am a 30 (F). As it says in the title, I was in an abusive relationship when I was in my teens. I've never felt comfortable reaching out to other domestic violence survivors because my abuser never got physical with me and we were best friends first, so for the longest time I didn't think it counted. I didn't even know I was in an abusive relationship until two years afterward. I really need to get this story off my chest.

He was my best friend first. When I was fourteen, a freshman in high school, I met A Boy, who was a sophomore. We were thrown together in our school's winter musical and bonded as chorus members. I had been warned about him before. Upperclassmen warned me away from him, saying he was odd without specifying why. Only that he was √ºber-religious, but I thought nothing of that. Funnily enough, I was also sort of a misfit growing up, and all I had wanted was for someone to talk to me, befriend me. So that's how I approached him. I knew we had both been bullied and I knew we were both oddballs, I thought we could bond over that. So, over the course of my freshman year, especially during rehearsals for the school musical, we became friends. He was who I went to when my divisive core friend group decided to turn against itself; I was who he went to when he wanted help navigating difficult social situations. We had inside jokes. We became best friends.

Looking back, it's difficult not to berate myself for ignoring everyone who warned me about him. I feel so stupid because he had made threats about shooting up the school that I somehow overlooked? A Boy made those threats the year before I got there and I heard it primarily through rumors, but my behavior was still pretty clown shoes. I‚Äôm unsure of how I could have overlooked something like that, the only explanation I can come up with is that there wasn‚Äôt as much awareness around mass violence when I was in high school. As much as it pains me to say it, shootings weren‚Äôt as common back then. There were no drills, no awareness around how to handle that kind of situation. According to my classmates, A Boy was placed on academic probation and let back in after a couple of months. Other kids were terrified that he was allowed to come back.

The abuse cycle started when I was fifteen. We were on and off for six months, during which I developed a self-harm problem due to burgeoning anxiety and depression, academic overachieving, cruel friends, authoritarian parents, etc. When I came to A Boy looking for help with cutting, he asked if I had cut myself with stainless-steel scissors, because if I hadn't, I would get tetanus and die.

There were other things he did that would take too long to explain here. There was shoving, yelling at and humiliating me in the school cafeteria to the point where I had a full-blown panic attack. He made a point to tell me about a punching bag he had hanging in his basement; about a former schoolmate for whom he'd lost all respect because she'd posted nude photos of herself on Facebook. He said nudity and sexuality were ""against his religion.""

The worst was the silent treatment when I did something he didn't like. He would just storm off. But this was a small school, and word traveled fast. Other kids would approach me and tell me the things A Boy had said about me behind my back: I was an ""indecisive bitch""; I would rather date ‚Äúretarded¬†faggots"" than date him. I was terrified that he would get physical. When I went to my mother for help, she said I was being a tease and to stop leading him on. My father said that A Boy could not have been abusive, because he was small and ungainly. My therapist at the time had labeled me ""boy crazy"".

I lived in fight or flight for months. Would wake up every school morning wondering if this was the day I would be beaten, or worse. Eventually, I just broke down. I was admitted to a psychiatric facility for eight weeks. Even then, A Boy my harassed my friends day in and day out stalking me, asking them, ""Where is she? I'm really worried about her."" My friends called the ward, asking my permission for them to let him know I was in psychiatric treatment. I said no, and it took everything just to say no. But I saw he was coming after me through my friends and didn't know what else to do. I was sixteen and I weighed 95 pounds at the time of my discharge. I started having nightmares from which I would wake screaming.

And I've seen pictures of A Boy with a rifle. I did try to confront him, about five years after the fact. He said that I had ruined him. He couldn't go on dates, he'd turned even more to religion. He was ""nothing but a monster"" that I wrote about. And I was his ""cross to bear,"" his ""penance."" I yelled at him, said some things I'm not proud of. I didn't want to be a player in his show of martyrdom, and I haven't spoken to him since. I've blocked him on every social media platform and have set all my socials to private.

I'm thirty now. I've been lucky enough to have found a really good therapist. I'm married to a loving husband, and we have two cats. I write in my free time. Recently, I've been doing grueling healing work with my therapist. It's taken me upwards of a decade to find empathy for who I used to be, to admit that I miss who I used to be. That I was a kid. And there is a moment, with the news of each new shooting, right before the gunman's identity is announced, when the pulse sings high and fast in my ears and everything slides out of focus. There's a lot I find I'm unable to communicate to my husband, because the nature of trauma is that it's unspeakable. He knows the raw materials of the situation, but sometimes I just don't know how to tell him that I still feel so raw, like a walking exposed nerve. In my mid-twenties, I made an effort to get fit and to bulk up, and I have found the gym to be a safe space away from home, but sometimes it‚Äôs still draining just to get out of bed. I still get the nightmares. I struggle with leaving the house and being in social situations. I‚Äôm on medication for PTSD and anxiety.

My therapist says my intentions with A Boy were sincere: I saw someone in need of a friend and tried to help him out. But I question myself every day. I am stable, but I am not okay.

I know this is heavy. And I'm so sorry if I've spooked or triggered anyone. Kindness is appreciated, even an upvote helps. And if you read this far, thank you.",2023-08-30 23:44:22,2025-03-17 03:37:31,survivor

vixui8,how do you manage infatuation when dating when you are a survivor of abusive relationships?,Ambie_Valance,14,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/vixui8/how_do_you_manage_infatuation_when_dating_when/,"Hi! I'm new here. I was in abusive relationships when i was young, so last one has been 8years ago. It has taken me a lot to recover due to me finding out i had complex ptsd in this time as well. First 3 years after my last abusive relationship, I was terrified of anyone approaching me, i couldn't date, the thought of kissing sb was already scary. After that I dated around, had lil stories, ranging from ok to bad and easy to v difficult, mostly exploring all i wasn't able to explore that much in my youth (like my bisexuality) and managing triggers, limerence and flashbacks. 

That was a bit for context, my abuse history doesn't feel present anymore and i manage my c-ptsd pretty well. But i still have doubts about dating new people, and one of them is how to go through infatuation, through the initial stage where dopamine gets high. I realized I?ve often had fwb relationships bc they weren't strong on infatuation and that made it easy for me (no expectations or triggers, etc). Or I had sex w people i didn't like, but was still attracted to them enough to have fun w it. A lot of emotional and relationship avoidance basically. I'm still not sure I want a serious relationship atm (only if it would fit my life and goals, which would be really difficult), but I met sb i like and would like to be balanced in this initial stage, to enjoy my time w him. I don't want to cut him off out of fear as i still don't know him, and i dont want to be afraid of enjoying the emotions that come up while getting to know him, but i obviously want to feel ok and not get into a risky situation. Was wondering how others handled this balance.",2022-06-23 14:11:17,2025-03-17 03:37:36,survivor
143mevd,Abuse survivor and I‚Äôm realizing I‚Äôm in it again. I need support.,plzdntfndme,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/143mevd/abuse_survivor_and_im_realizing_im_in_it_again_i/,"Here‚Äôs a short background: 
I (33F) have been married to my husband (34M) for 5 years. We‚Äôve been together for 7 years. We have a 2 year old together. I was in a 5 year abusive relationship with a man 10 years older than myself prior to this relationship. It was very abusive. I also have estranged myself from my family of origin because of abuse. I see and have seen a specialized psychotherapist for years and also have been in therapy years and years before. It‚Äôs a constant and I feel safe in therapy. 


My husband had been drinking one day. He got home from golf at 12:30pm and was clearly intoxicated. I noticed and asked how many drinks he had and he immediately started to gaslight me into thinking I have a drinking problem. I do not. My family has issues with substance use disorder, so I‚Äôm limited when I drink. I feel triggered when he‚Äôs drunk or others are. I avoid it. 

He's financially abusive. He recently forced me to cut back on therapy because he said it's too expensive, but he wouldn‚Äôt share bank info with me besides our joint account. This changed yesterday when I confronted him after many confrontations. He shared the financial information after he told me he doesn‚Äôt trust me with money. Then said he thought I‚Äôd empty everything and leave. That is not a thought I‚Äôve even had. 

I feel trapped. I can't get a job because I'm about to have surgery for endometriosis. That alone is an issue because he doesn't understand the pain I deal with chronically and he doesn't seem to care. He tells me I don't do fun things with our 2 year old, however, I do. I do what my body allows me to do. He is constantly shaming me for my limitations and this makes me feel as if I'm a bad parent. 

I am estranged from my family due to violent and emotional abuse my entire life. I don't have a support system built yet. I'm very scared of him because he's not himself when he drinks. He just left randomly in the middle of the day to go golf. It‚Äôs a work day. I now don‚Äôt have access to a car with my child, I also have to hope he doesn‚Äôt return home drunk. He‚Äôs even thrown a heavy crystal picture frame at me back when I was pregnant during an argument. I‚Äôm scared of making him angry. He‚Äôs yelled at me and slammed doors in front of our baby. 

He‚Äôs responsible for recent sexual coercion. I can‚Äôt be intimate because of my endometriosis. It causes me intense pain that lasts days. He has tried to convince me to do things for him and I reluctantly have. I feel a lot of shame. I hate this life. 

I know I need to leave, I‚Äôm terrified. I‚Äôm posting because I‚Äôve only talked to my therapist about most of this. I‚Äôm afraid to share info with my closest friend. She lives in another state. I wish I could get this all figured out. I feel frozen and I don‚Äôt know what to do or where to start. 

I‚Äôve spoken with the domestic abuse hotline recently. I know there are resources. I‚Äôm very worried about custody if I leave. I have CPTSD, depression, Dissociative Identity Disorder, major anxiety and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd end up with our child and could use my diagnoses against me. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm scared and very isolated. I need support desperately. Even from strangers. It‚Äôs hard being a survivor of abuse and enduring it all over again. I am so afraid of starting over. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd even go.",2023-06-07 19:26:58,2025-03-17 03:37:37,survivor
14wapc2,Body shaming abusers here only hurts survivors and shouldn't be allowed on any support sub.,DiscardedVictim,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/14wapc2/body_shaming_abusers_here_only_hurts_survivors/,"I don't have much to say about this since it's one of the most exhausting topics to discuss for me personally.

A few months ago, I saw a post on either this sub or another survivor community that celebrated a user's abuser going bald as some form of karmic justice. As a balding survivor who comes to these subs for support, community, and empowerment, what I read only made surviving what I went through more difficult at what was the lowest point of my life.

OP and the comments all seemed to show no awareness as to how many AMAB survivors in -all- support subreddits had to (or continue to) go through our genetic ""male"" pattern baldness being accelerated by the stress our abusers put us through. Many of the comments perpetuated blanket statements like ""going bald is punishment for being a bad person,"" which I'm sure all abusers of us with the MPB gene would LOVE to be true. At the time, it took all the restraint I had to not point out how toxic the post/comments were, and how comparable their mentalities were to those many of our abusers would subscribe to.

My hair loss is something my abuser used to devalue me that I can't ever change. I have no doubts that she continues to make jokes to this day that revolve around her replacement(s) for me being an upgrade since they're not losing their hair. The years which I had a full head of hair were wasted on and shortened by pursuing a textbook case of BPD with antisocial tendencies.

Now that nobody is there to help her keep her alcoholism in check, my abuser has gained noticeable weight since discarding me. However, you'll never see me celebrating what often is the result of another survivor's trauma, especially in a public community consisting predominantly of such survivors seeking help.

TL;DR: When you use body shaming to devalue your abuser, you assist many of our abusers in devaluing us.",2023-07-10 23:55:11,2025-03-17 03:37:38,survivor

Why aren't we automatically informed when someone new reports them as abusive?! I spend nights awake staring at the ceiling panicking because I know he's dating someone now, and I know this woman has kids, I know no other details. But I feel physically sick knowing what he will eventually do to her and how he will mess up those children by hurting their mum or (I desperately hope not) hurting them.

I don't want to know her details, I just want her to get a copy of my video interview, and I want to be notified if she ever goes to the police so I can fucking remind them I came forward too so they don't dismiss her.

I think the thing that hurts me most about the police throwing my case in the bin is that it means he can escalate. I've seen enough to know that when (not if!) he kills a woman the prosecutor will use me as an example of how he has behaved previously. It shouldn't get to that. 

I know he will do it again. He nearly killed me more than once.
I'm alive because I pretended to be dead a few times and eventually ran with nothing except my cat ffs. I just can't sleep at the minute because I'm terrified I'll wake up to a news story of a woman stabbed to death and her kids either orphaned or dead.

There was no way that would feel safe telling the truth about what was really happening, so it only served to drag the relationship on even longer.  As long as the abuser was there it did not feel like a safe space.

The only thing that did work out for me in couple‚Äôs therapy was after I was talked in to going back for a second round of therapy, this was after I had told him I wanted out of the marriage. It was the first session, and I just blurted out everything had been happening the whole time, including the suicide threats. I said I had wanted out for a very long time but he would threaten to kill himself. The therapist immediately separated us, she told me to go home and pack everything I needed, and made us go no contact for two weeks (which he broke within 2 days). I never went back.

Advice for survivors with no justice?,saintbreezus08,10,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/vjvj5k/justice_system_fails_the_abused_once_again_advice/,"This is a really long story that I will do my best to consolidate without leaving too many details out‚Ä¶

In April of 2020 I met the single worst person I think I ever have, in my life to date. I was already in uncertain times with just losing my job due to Covid, living alone going crazy. Feeling very vulnerable. Got bored, scrolled tinder and hit it off with my (soon to be) abuser.

Things were wonderful at first. We had so much in common with they way we grew up even names of family members being the same. We spent a lot of time together. I noticed small little lies in the beginning (he said he had a car, first time we meet he‚Äôs in an Uber not intoxicated‚Ä¶ he admits later her never has said car etc.) things that seemed stupid to harp over considering how bonded we felt immediately. After about a month of being in each other‚Äôs constant presence and including being intimate as well‚Ä¶ he ghosts me. Me being me (dumb and blind), I kept trying to figure out what I did and his response was always so vague. I backed off and went about my life (although admittedly, very hurt).

Summer 2020 is now here and he decides to contact me again where we start a similar cycle as before. Always together, making food, watching movies just enjoying each other. But this time he doesn‚Äôt ghost me. He stays around and starts sneaking insulting comments in when he talks to me (telling me how incompetent I am, commenting on my weight) he was not working at this time either, but did not have unemployment benefits like I had due to the pandemic. I was paying for literally everything for us to survive and not really keeping tabs because I just wanted to help this man who I thought had love for me too. And that‚Äôs why ignored all of these little red flags to begin with. During this time, a lot of personal issues happened to me (I won‚Äôt deny that we were drinking a lot together at this time, as well as him having a cocaine issue, more on that later) I actually ended up with a dui and my car was stolen a month later. Feeling down on my luck and in a major depressive state, I continue to stay with this person. He starts needing money a lot or saying he will go get us food and just not coming back. Tensions are running high and I start seeing his true colors. He never cared about me and was using me. I wanted him out of my life, I just didn't have the strength at that moment.

One evening, he was out with his friends and came home very drunk and under the influence of prescription drugs as well. We were both drinking (I had just started, he had already been) I was also making dinner when he starts accusing me of stealing one of his AirPods. Which I didn‚Äôt, I later found it in my couch. He goes ballistic. Rips my entire closet out. Throws a full length mirror out of my 3rd story apartment, smashes my tv in. Leaves with a cell phone I bought and let him use when his broke. At this point I needed to be done so I call police. Cops arrive and are very dismissive when they find out we were drinking. I want to file a report but I am afraid so I don‚Äôt.

The rest of summer goes on and I don‚Äôt hear from him and don‚Äôt contact him either. But he did leave a lot of clothes at my house like he always did‚Ä¶ as a means to contact me later. At this point it is fall, beginning of November and he contacts me about these things which I was more than happy to give him. He comes over and another cycle begins. This time, his living situation takes a turn and he becomes homeless due to being evicted. Although I did not want him residing in my house, I truly felt bad and didn‚Äôt want him homeless for the holidays. So I let him stay. He starts telling me he loves me, I was on probation and quit drinking. But he was still doing drugs and drinking. I witness first hand how on edge and desperate his addiction can make him and I know that I can't go on much longer like this. The insults are getting worse, I knew his temper from before when he destroyed my house. He is paranoid and starts accusing me of giving him STD's starts insinuating that he would kill himself and me if it were true.  It was all too much and I felt utterly stuck and didn't know what to do because he always guilt tripped me into letting him stay.

Things are bad at this point and to make matters worse, he started pulling back and not being affectionate anymore. Still called me baby when he needs something and when he was manipulating but stopped sleeping in bed with me and pretty much set up camp in my living room. This was not how I wanted to live I was miserable and my self esteem was all but gone. Our arguments were always volatile and one night I found used condoms. I was disgusted and confronted him and he lies and says him and his friend were playing pranks on people. I let it go but knew he lied, I was just so week and downtrodden in these times and didn't want another argument. Then, I find work, YAY! I go back to work and it was so liberating. I found a little confidence and was feeling better even though home life was bad. One night I went home and again started making dinner. I slipped up and brought some alcohol home. I drank a beer and 4 shots I believe. As for him, it appeared he had been drinking all day. He was fine until I started talking about a coworker at work who I found to be attractive (I know that was a very bad decision in hindsight but I did it and I take responsibility for that) he flies into another rage fit and chokes me out with my scarf while calling me a whore, disgusting telling me I like what he was doing. I thought at first he was being playful, but when he wouldn't let go I knew I had to do something so I tried breaking free and facetimed my friend as my phone was in hand from just talking with her. She picks up and see's the very end of this interaction when I broke away and I immediately go and lock myself in my room crying and talking to her. I calm down and ask him why he would do that and I don't remember his reasoning but he then proceeded to say he was going to skin me, wear my as a blanket... kill my cat... kill me with a chainsaw like in American Psycho. All with a smirk on his face. I decide to not engage and go to bed. I was shocked and afraid.

The next day was a Friday. I knew I did not want to be around him so I made plans to stay with a friend. I go out to her place straight after work and don't speak to him. I wake up on Saturday and decide I would like to see him ( this is the worst thing about toxic relationships, the I hate you but I love you parts) I take a Lyft home because I did not know if my car would start with my breathalyzer since we stayed up super late. I get home and he is leaving but it was Valentines day weekend, I was hoping he could have courtesy to stay with me. He said he would not. I said well before you come back, we need to have a conversation about the other night. He becomes angry and I had absolutely had it at this point. I say you need to leave, forever. Don't forget your clothes this time okay? So I go to my closet and start grabbing his things. This makes it worse. I turn around from my closet and he pushes me over holds me down and strikes me in the face. I am screaming crying telling him to leave and he does and leaves his key on my table. I am in shock and adrenaline kicks in. I know I need to leave so I get my cat and go back to my friends house. I couldn't find my regular set of keys and so I grabbed his key he gave me and left. I ended up with a fat, bruised and cut lip, some scratches and the beginning of bruises on my chest. I take pictures of what I could. My friend drove me home to search for my keys and I find them. I still did not feel safe there so I grab my keys and put the spare on the hook. That night (valentines) I kept getting calls from the call box of my apartment but I knew it was him and did not answer.

It is now Monday and I went to work. On lunch I come home and find he had somehow gotten in. There is a cake, flowers and a handwritten note from him apologizing for leaving. I am now petrified. How did he get in? Why would he come back? Is this a scare tactic? I see my spare key I put back the day before is gone. I knew it was time to call the police again. I fill out a statement and they helped me talk to my leasing office to have the locks changed. While I am waiting for them to come change my locks, someone walks into my apartment. It was two friends of his. I tell them to leave but they say abuser left a backpack here they came to get it. I say take it give me my key and leave. They do. So I call police again to report that incident. Bruises are getting worse now and I take pictures as they turn colors etc. There was a clear handprint on my chest. The cops have now issued felony assault and menacing dv warrant.

Fast forward to this past Tuesday. His trial begins. He would not take any plea deals. I had to testify, and it was terrible. I was re-traumatized, humiliated and so nervous and anxiety ridden that I was physically sick. I know defense lawyers are there to protect their clients and my abuser was his client but what was said in that courtroom was disgusting and more insulting then anything. I felt like the jury believed me. They had some questions and I answered them and I felt good after it was over. His defense at trial was that we were never in a relationship and his friends got up and said the same thing. He may have hidden me from them and started pulling away at the end but we were in a relationship... even though we never had that conversation. He once locked himself out of my apartment and identified himself as such to my leasing office to get in.  He told me he loved me. Called me baby and we were sleeping and living together. I had submitted texts to prove this. They needed me to come back yesterday and I did. But abuser decides to take the stand. My victim advocate said he looked so bad up there that they didn't need me to testify after all and they send me home.

The jury came back and acquitted him of all charges. Well it was actually a hung jury that couldn't decide due to one man I am told that was not convinced we were together. Prosecutors apologize profusely saying it was a mistake not to put me back up there but after they juries reaction to his explanation they thought he was toast. Had I testified again, the evidence of our relationship would have been seen by the jury and I just feel like this would have ended a different way. 

I never wanted to go to trial, I never asked for any of the abuse. I never wanted to be here. I am absolutely gutted to the core. I found out about numerous other women he has done this to. He will do this again and again. Our justice system is so broken and I need to move on. But how do you move on when someone gets out of something like this and you know there will be someone else in your shoes later... And you tried so hard to prevent it. Thank you for reading this if you are still here and please leave any advice you have to get over the heartache something like this brings. I am definitely going to need therapy.",2022-06-24 18:50:44,2025-03-17 03:37:50,survivor

Make no mistake. Many people here are not in the US and many people are. Wherever you live, *this will affect you or people you love.*

This administration will have a chilling effect on survivors of abuse, and we have now have a president who is a rapist and sexual harasser/assaulter of women, and who openly declared there are ""only two genders"" (NOPE) and a VP who openly hates women. Anti-2SLGBTQIA+ rhetoric and policies are surging. Our immigrant neighbors are in danger and the Executive Orders we have already seen and will continue to see will have impacts that are wide-ranging and devastating.

I am reaffirming what this sub is all about: safety and respect for survivors. Ableism, transphobia, homophobia, racism, misogyny, and xenophobia do not belong here. Period. Nor does telling anyone with a uterus who wants to seek an abortion that abortion is morally wrong (it isn't).

**Pro-woman means pro-feminism.** It does not mean that we justify the actions of female abusers nor negate abuse against men by women. Read the sidebar for the list of resources for male survivors and the rule that says ""No stating that only women can be abused and only men can be abusive.""

If you endorse misogyny in this sub, you are not welcome here.

We have always done our absolute best to remove any content that endorses any of the above, and will continue to do so.

After the presidential election results we saw a sizeable uptick in misogyny in this sub.

Fuck. That. Let this be a warning: if you endorse *any* of the above in this sub - there will be no second chances. This isn't a game. These are peoples' lives.

I 've been in an abusive relationship for more than 2 years, in my late teens. I escaped  nearly 3 years ago and since then went no contact with my ex.

I went to therapy, hypnosis. I also had 2 other relationships (non abusive ones) after this one. I think I improved a lot during the last 3 years and I'm overall happier and more peaceful.

However, a few days ago, I realised at least 2 friends of mine are still friends with my abuser. At first I didn't think it would bother me, but since then I can't sleep properly. I feel anxious again and feel I could no longer commit to any kind of relationship (even a true and deep friendship) even though I know good people exist (I'm single atm btw).

I feel very vulnerable again, probably because there is still a little link between my ex and me through these friends. I thought I wouldn't still be afraid of him after all this time but the reality is that I still fear him and what he would do if we were in the same room/place.

I'm just so tired to always be afraid of relationships, afraid of being hurt or abused, of being abandoned and especially tired to be afraid of him. Do you have some piece of advice for me to heal completely?

He was my first boyfriend, i lost my virginity to him, and I was head over heels in love. I thought he was perfect. A couple months in he ""caught"" me smoking weed - he showed up at my house after ignoring all my phone calls, the house reeked of weed and i was literally sitting on my bed naked after a shower. We hadnt been dating long and when he bursted in i tried to cover my naked body, he yanked the blanket off and started spanking me until i was bleeding. I was so caught off guard. I stayed with him for 3 years after this and indured so much abuse. I stayed because I was in love and life can be gray sometimes. I knew that he was making my life unbearable but I couldn't imagine life without him. He was all I had- that was his intention. When i finally left him for good i spent about 3 months crying over him- missing him, wanting him back. But thank god i never went to see him because it would have probably been right back to square one. We did text/call frequently and the truth is sometimes we still do. Weve been broken up for almost 1.5 years now, the past year has been one of the best of my life but i still call him sometimes. I know i shouldnt but i do. I do think a big part of it is wanting him to know how good my life is without him and then also because he was my first and only ""love."" 

I haven't loved anyone since him so far- but i have met some of the most amazing men. They helped change my thought process of ""i hate men"" & ""all men are bad."" I don't hate men any more.

tree5s,My mom is an abuse survivor - I never witnessed the abuse and am coming to terms with how it‚Äôs impacted my own life.,joblessinperth,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/tree5s/my_mom_is_an_abuse_survivor_i_never_witnessed_the/,"I‚Äôm 26 and my parents seperated when I was a week old. 

In short, my father is mentally ill and was extremely verbally and emotionally abusive to my mom who had a difficult pregnancy with me. Constantly screaming at her, accusing her of insane things, and a lot of other horrible stuff. She was on bed rest the later half of her pregnancy where she needed someone to care for her and my father would come home late, sometimes throwing an apple at her for dinner. 

The final straw was when I was a baby, he threatened her and told her to ‚Äúwatch her ass‚Äù before he left for work. She took that as a direct threat, packed up her things and me and moved back in with my grandparents and never went back. 

As I got older, my father forced her to court for visitation rights so I had to see him. I hated going. She always let my father have a relationship with me but also kept me safe. 

My whole life, this has just been normal to me and I‚Äôve felt like he ‚Äúhas‚Äù to be in my life, like an obligation. But his mental problems have continued and worsened and he refuses to get help because all he needs is ‚ÄúJesus.‚Äù I am the only person he hasn‚Äôt ostracized or left, and I‚Äôve felt a lot of pressure to ‚Äúfix‚Äù him‚Ä¶.but lately, I realized that this isn‚Äôt my responsibility. 

Anyway, in therapy, I‚Äôve noticed a pattern where I tend to go for guys who have issues and I‚Äôm wondering if this is linked to him. 

I never directly witnessed the abuse but I have been the one dealing with his craziness through the years. Weird comments and public outbursts and quite honestly, I‚Äôm sick of it and only talk to him because I feel sorry for him. 

In all honesty, I hate him for the way he treated my mom and it‚Äôs taken a long time to get enough distance to realize that this isn‚Äôt normal and he‚Äôs not just ‚Äúweird.‚Äù

I go weeks without speaking to him and when I do, I have to force myself to answer the phone. Sometimes he guilts me for not speaking to him enough. But ignoring him is the only way I know how to draw a boundary, but it doesn‚Äôt solve the root of the problem. 

I want to give him an ultimatum in order to have a relationship with me: get professional help or lose me. I‚Äôm working through boundary setting etc in therapy but I‚Äôd appreciate any insight from this sub on navigating this and processing what happened.

I was never the kind of person that easily ""hates"" or ""hold grudges.""

Because I don't like the feeling of being angry, it hurts me and it's pointless. 

I always knew forgiving isn't about erasing that person's mistakes in their favor. It's about relieving the weight from those memories in YOUR favor.

That's how I deal with being bullied in the past, broken hearted and more.

But abuse is different.

I want that narcissist to trip over her own narcissism.

I want the girl who teamed with her instead of teaming with me, as she should have, to really regret it and realize the mistake she made in the worst way.

I want them both to be sorry, but being realistic, they never will. They were too blind to even respect me for once or recognize what they did.

Where do I shove this, basically? How do I ""forgive""? I'm angry and I have the right to be. But same to all kinds of anger, it's useless in the end. 

As I said, I'm almost never hateful. There are many people I could hate and I decide not to.

My abuser is different from me and hates a lot, by the way. She hates me now for stopping her blood-sucking.  It feeds her ego to believe how everyone else deserves her hate while she's so perfect and victmized.",2021-08-24 18:06:04,2025-03-17 03:38:06,survivor

taims0,Advice for partners of abuse survivors?,KillMariner,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/taims0/advice_for_partners_of_abuse_survivors/,"Hi all! I hope it is ok to post here. This is my first ever post on reddit, but I just don't know where else to go. My gf left an abusive marriage a couple years back (the divorce will be final so so soon!), and we started dating not long after (we have known each other for years but lost touch when her abuser worked to isolate her from her support network). She has done so much work on walking away, holding her boundaries, and learning to name the abuse, and I am UNBELIEVABLY proud of her.

My question for y'all is this: as a partner of a survivor and not the survivor myself, how can I deal with my own anger at my partner's abuser without making it my partner's problem? I hate her ex-wife so much it sometimes feels like I'm going to explode. I have worked really hard to keep this rage pointed firmly AWAY from my gf, and I am in therapy where I can talk about it more freely, but every time something new happens with her divorce proceedings or we hit a milestone in our own relationship, it kicks up all this emotional dust in the corners of my mind that is somehow both mine and not about me at all. I really love my gf and I don't want to spend the rest of our relationship periodically stewing in anger and helplessness, but the idea that anyone could treat someone I love so badly really messes me up.  I also find myself comparing myself to her abuser in a way I never do with the regular exes of people I date. I can't stand the idea that someone so horrible could be more attractive or more successful or have had a deeper initial connection with my gf than me. I feel like jealousy and anger don't get talked about much in spaces that are (correctly!) more focused on getting free of abusers and recovering internal self-worth.

Thoughts? Advice? Suggestions for a different forum I could post this in, because I really don't want to take up space here if it is meant for people more directly impacted by abuse?",2022-03-09 21:53:37,2025-03-17 03:38:09,survivor

Here is my survivor story.,East_Impact4101,29,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/malvxg/my_ex_is_48_im_19_and_we_started_dating_when_i/,"Hi, this is my story. Some info to start with. Im 19 a female and i live in US on the east coast. I wont say what state exactly bc safety! This story is from 2017-2020. So here goes...

When i was 16 i was a ward of the state due to my parents being horrible parents to me. I took my trauma from them and used it to gain attention from older men online. I met a man in December 2017 on an app meant for adult hookups, who i thought was attractive. Let‚Äôs call him C. C was a college professor in the US on the east coast. I was a 16 year old traumatized, abused girl looking to be loved by anyone. I ended up running away due to non related reasons and had asked C if i could stay a week or two until i could drift to my next place to hideout. He told me to stay as long as i would like because he was lonely etc etc. so i stayed for a week, then three weeks, then two months and so on. C constantly told me because of our age difference we would never date and that i was just staying there and we could be FWB. Well after being there for 5 months, C asked me to date him because he had caught feelings and so did i. We started dating and before long he had to go out West to see his two kids at his ex wifes house. During the summer of 2018 he left to see his kids and i watched the house. I had two friends of mine move in (with permission) and we started living together so i was less lonely. Well at that age i wasnt even 100% sure if C was being honest when he said he wanted to date. He was talking to women from all these states which he drove through all of them to get to the west. I also had found out he slept with his ex in our bed when i was living there and had visited my family. Well me being the stupid teen i was, i joined a popular dating app and started seeing other guys. I was in the wrong 100% because two wrongs dont make a right. I know this now but i didnt care back then. So my housemates ended up snitching because i wanted them gone. They were destroying mine and my exes house, stealing shit, i caught them trying to steal my limited edition R2D2 xbox 360 that didnt even work. So i told them they have 30 days to leave or i was calling the cops. So they decided to tell C of what i had done. He drove home drunk (oh yeah forgot to mention hes an alcoholic, even to this day) left his kids behind A WEEK EARLY (they dont speak to him bc of him leaving a week early and bc i cussed his baby momma out for trying to start shit with me) and burst through the front door and started calling out to me. I was hiding because i felt ashamed and disgusting for what i had done. How could i do something so terrible? He smashed my vape, took my phone, and didnt look at me or even want to be in the same room as me. The next day we started fighting and i walked out to go to the park and listen to music while swinging. As im walking farther away from the house i get a bad feeling in my gut, so i turn around and jog back to my house. The entire back of the house is pumping out plumes of black smoke. I run into the house and smell/hear a fucking fire. I go to our bedroom and the bed is completely engulfed in flames... i see a pile of clothes and thought it was C. I get into gear grab a bucket, while choking on smoke,to fill it with water in the kitchen. I run upstairs to see C carrying a fire extinguisher while smiling like a mad man. My housemates at this point are outside with their cat. I go out and ask what the fuck happened. They tell me that they heard what sounded like Lysol or something in an aerosol can. Then WHOOSH and the smoke. He comes down and says we can come in. He is shirtless and covered in soot. He ended up with second and third degree burns on his hands from trying to pat the fire out with the comforter. One day in August we were fighting and i said that i wanted to go back to placement and never see him again. I told him i wish he never got to see his kids again and he snapped. He started chasing me and we ended up outside because i was trying to get help. He threw me to the ground and started STRANGLING me! Not lightly choking not kinky choking like completely cutting off my airways until the point i saw my life flash before my eyes and i knew i would die and nobody would know or care. And i felt at peace knowing i was about to die. Little did we both know someone drove up the road and saw me and him rolling around in the dirt. They continued down the road turned around and arrived just in time for C to let go of me. The people in the car asked me something i think when i sat up. I dont really remember due to blacking out after sitting up. I remember waking up on the air mattress we had. C was laying next to me staring. He looked worried. I went to the bathroom not saying a word and looked in the mirror. I had a deep blueish purple mark on my neck... you could see each of his fingers where they had squeezed so tightly. I just looked at myself and cried. Sorry i sobbed. I sobbed because i felt broken. He kept apologizing to me and idk why but i forgave him. I forgave him because i loved him so much. Well C promised to change but he didnt. I was found by police and brought back to my state and was held in a residential facility until i was 18 (a year). C came and got me from my home state (he had moved to the west to start establishing stuff for when i got out) the day i turned 18 i left the system and left my homestate behind. We got engaged. I thought he had changed like he said he did. I thought it was for the best but it wasnt. Cs drinking got better from the last time i had seen him. But then he slowly digressed again. It was back to him hitting me, taking my stuff, breaking my stuff, and he would throw all of my belongings away. I stayed like that for another 7 months and finally i called it quits. He didnt have sex with me, wouldnt cuddle me or anything to be connected and close to me. I had found out he was meeting up with his coworker from Starbucks and he and she would drink, get drunk and i caught then holding hands and being unfaithful (she was also dating an older guy but tried to take my man, lets say my home state is a tough one. And she fucked with the wrong one. Dont fuck with the girl whose daddy taught her to fight grown men ;) ) so i caught them and that was the end for me. I packed my shit and travelled to a beautiful city and stayed in a hotel. He then said he wanted to try and make it work one more time. My dumb ass fell for it. I went back to our apartment with him and not even two days later we get into a fight, he puts his hands on me, and i decked him in the chin and in the ballsack. I then grabbed the phone i had purchased after he took my other one, my purse and wallet and made sure my ID and shit were inside (he would take my debit cards, he destroyed my birth certificate and ATE one of my social security cards) when i tried getting my service dog ready to take with me he grabbed the leash from me and told me i couldnt take MY dog. The dog he didnt even want. I then went to a friends, got a bus ticket to my Aunts house in the mid west, got my own apartment and job in less than a month. I then ended up suicidal and had a breakdown. So i packed my bags went to Ohio to catch a train to my homestate and never looked back. Now im in a new relationship with a guy who is around my age (im 19 hes 23) and we live happy with our four cats and his family. Im trying to move past that part of my life. 

Thank you for allowing me to share my story. Ive been through alot. I wasnt handed the best cards in life but im making the most out of what i got.

So, I was in a bad DV situation for a long time in a small town in the middle of nowhere. I finally was able to leave and I went to the nearest city. I kept calling DV shelters, but none had a bed open. So I decided to leave the state and go far away to start my life over somewhere new. I got to the new state and couldn't get into a DV shelter because they said I ""wasn't considered DV anymore because I got myself away""... Ok... Then I got told I don't qualify for the state's DV rehousing grant because I don't have kids (requirement )... So I ended up in a homeless shelter. The homeless shelter refuses to believe I was in DV because ""too many homeless girls lie about it"" and because ""I seem to be adjusting too well""... Ooookkkk... Then they called me ""judgemental "" because I am having a hard time interacting with other residents because I don't do drungs or drink (I only smoke cigarettes) and I'm not interacting with the other residents like they are my ""friends"" (they are all just stealing from each other and lying to and about each other). Staff and the other residents act like I am lying about everything in my past because of ""how I turned out"" (meaning I'm not strung out or etc), lying everything I am currently saying, etc, and keep intentionally giving me horrible advice and making promises they don't intend to keep, they (staff and residents) are making fun of me/my situation, they make fun of where I'm from, and they are hoping to sabotage anything good I have going for me. Since I've left him almost 2 months ago now, I've been told that I dont even qualify as DV anymore, yet I feel I never got the healing and help I needed to begin with!! I have no family, a friend back home but they can't help. I'm beside myself and massively depressed. What do I do??",2025-03-17 04:46:32,2025-03-17 15:34:15,help

1arb45r,Are these warning signs of future abuse and should I 27(f) leave my 27(m) boyfriends house?,thekoirawarrior,34,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1arb45r/are_these_warning_signs_of_future_abuse_and/,"I've been dating a guy for six months, from the very start on our first date he was quite tempermental towards people and things around him but he was also funny and nice to hang out with so the night went well and we kissed etc.

After this first night he was very active and openly interested in pursuing things, we texted everyday, he responds very quickly to texts and we saw each other constantly, couldn't really stay away from eachother, that honeymoon phase feeling.fast track a few months and I was moving to a different city for 6 months as was planned before I met him. He is very temperamental and openly admits that he has issues with anger and is difficult. He doesn't like kissing in general and we never really ""french kiss"" even during sex, we also don't really have much affection otherwise, I put this down to a cultural thing. I am always a bit worried going out with him because I feel like if the slightest thing is wrong with his food, table, drink, whatever, he will throw a temper tantrum. 

I feel like he always needs things to go his way or he will be annoyed, but he also gets over the annoyance rather quickly. Everything got escalated after for unexpected reasons I couldn't stay in the flat in the new city and had to move in with him as where I live it's a very difficult renting situation. The first week living here there was a party where we all drank to much and we had an argument, and he threw my phone at me which cut my lip pretty badly. He apologised that night, drunk, when I threatened to leave but never brought it up apologetically again sober. around the house there are also holes in the wall where he has lost his temper and punched a while (mind not due to me at least yet).

He hasn't intentionally meant to hurt me but for the first 4 months of our relationship he was pinching me and biting me ""playfully"" but doing it really hard and I told him many many times to stop because it hurt, after some months he finally did. He is very selfish with what we do and he doesn't want to compromise on what music we listen to, movies we watch, sex he makes all about him and his needs. If we watch a movie I like he won't concentrate on it, talk through the whole thing or goes on his phone. 

It sounds all doom and gloom but we do also have a good time together cooking and sometimes laughing together, he says I am the love of his life and we should buy a house etc. he is very organised with cleanliness and finances and part of the reason I fell for him was this mundane security I felt he had in control which alot of my exes didn't have.

but something doesn't really feel right here.. he speaks to me in a really angry tone of voice most of the time kind of like ""why did you do that stupid thing"" type of way which I have told him to stop, but it seems to just be his nature.. he never asks me questions or seems interested in my stories or thoughts and it's lonely for someone talkative like me.

Now the possibility has arisen for me to get a flatshare with a family member and I have been looking at flats.. I am scared how he would react to me moving out so I thought I will not tell him until I have confirmed somewhere and then I will let him know calmly that for me this was too soon to move in together, but if he is willing to work on some of these worrying qualities we could still try to date. 

He also told me the other day while he was annoyed at something and apologising for the night before that he had been to therapy for 6 months to work on his anger and it was worse before. I appreciate anyone working on themselves but this also worried me. I don't feel much empathy from him, it seems he is very him first, he wants the comfier seat everytime at the restaurant, he wants to pick the movie we watch at the cinema with my friends etc. He swears alot and jokes about violence, and eating my pet rabbit and jokes about her alot but he also feeds her and cleans her cage etc so might just put that down to insensitive humour.

I feel terribly guilty looking at flats and thinking about moving behind his back, especially because he got me flowers and a nice jewelry for Valentine's Day but I'm trying to tell myself to focus on the bigger picture. He also kicked his previous girlfriend out of the house and I cannot take that risk as I have nowhere to go if this happens because I have a pet.

Please share similar experiences..",2024-02-15 08:47:53,2025-03-17 16:31:08,signs

1. Attraction/ obsession with a certain unhealthy body type and wanting you to stay that body type forever (example- unhealthily skinny or overweight) 
2. Keeps track on all the women he has slept with as trophies, has lists with their names or full on notebooks with contacts
3. Ageism. Saying things like ""women at 25 are already expired"", constantly searching for barely legal girls for sexual escapades and borderline paedophilic preferences.
4. Financial restriction, even if it's regarding your own money. You might end up hiding receipts and feeling guilty for a certain purchase. 
5. Inclination to force non-monogamy, even if that makes you uncomfortable and was said numerous times. Also, non-monogamy that only suits him and involves multiple women.
6. Bullshit excuses such as, ""men will always want to fuck as much as possible""; ""it's in our DNA"" and ""we need to spread the seed""
7. Hate for the non-sexual bodily functions of women, such as menstruating
8. Substance abuse. I don't know why this is still such a taboo, I am pretty liberal myself ( I am okay with recreational drug use from time to time) and I still think that when a substance is used everyday to the point of addiction, well that is an atmosphere for abuse. 
9. They cheated with you, they cheated on previous partners or wanted you to leave an existing relationship for them. 
10. Treating women as disposable and thinking it's a ""cool"" and ""macho"" behaviour.",2022-01-08 15:15:01,2025-03-17 16:31:11,signs

Stalking

Asking for money/place to stay too early in the relationship

Trash talking everyone in your life in order to isolate you

PHYSICAL ATTACKS

Verbal attacks on your looks, sexuality, past

Blaming everyone in their own life

Using excessive social media and addiction to pornography

Changing life-story to fit your personal views

Threats

These are currently the few I can think of. If anyone noticing any of these behaviours in a person you're newly dating, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

I‚Äôm a 26-year-old woman, and I‚Äôve been with my partner (26M) for almost three years. Lately, I‚Äôve noticed some concerning changes in how he handles conflict, and I‚Äôm worried this could be a sign that our relationship is heading in a dangerous direction.

Over the past four to six months, he has completely lost the ability to stay calm during arguments. He shakes with anger, shuts down, and places all the blame on himself‚Äîsaying things like, ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm just a horrible partner; this is all my fault.‚Äù He also yells at me violently and has thrown things in frustration (though not at me and not intentionally). He hasn‚Äôt hit a wall or become physically aggressive toward me, but his reactions still worry me‚Äîespecially because we have a son, and he‚Äôs behaved this way in front of him.

I‚Äôm scared this could escalate, and I‚Äôm also confused because we never used to fight like this. I don‚Äôt want to just walk away without understanding what‚Äôs happening, but I also don‚Äôt want to ignore red flags. For those who have experienced abusive relationships, does this sound like the beginning of one? I‚Äôd really appreciate any insight or advice.",2025-02-10 19:01:03,2025-03-17 16:31:26,signs

He entered the room (he had already been drinking for a couple of hours) and asked me to come out multiple times and I calmly expressed that I feel stressed out with academics. On his third attempt to ask me to come out of his room, he finally lost it. He started pointing his finger while saying I‚Äôm the worst for ruining the celebration for him. Long story short, I started crying so much because I don‚Äôt do too well with harsh words (which I‚Äôve told him about hundreds of times already) but he still continued.

He then proceeded to throw his vape on the floor, his glasses, and he threw his new phone at his laptop and it almost broke. He then proceeded to tell me it was all my fault. He then started hitting himself and I was crying so hard while telling him ‚Äúplease stop, love‚Äù. But he kept hitting himself again and again. And he repeatedly kept saying i‚Äôm the worst person while pushing my temple with his finger.

Are those signs that if i let it slide, he will eventually become more violent?

üö© Excessive calling when I was out with friends. Keeping track of my social media
üö© Getting angry and giving me attitude if I didn't pick up his phone call RIGHT away just to accused me of talking to other men online
üö©Jealousy about ANY men in my life. Demanding to block and remove my ex phone number. Getting angry when I just looked at someone at a grocery store
üö© Violent short temper. Yelling in my face, punching couch. 
üö© Not letting me leave, shoving me, slapping my hands and telling me that wasn't hitting. 

And while all this was happening, I had no idea I was being emotionally abused. Luckily I left him.

How many do you identify of your ex or current partner? 

COMMON SIGNS ABUSE:

* Your partner keeps track of everything you do. They monitor where you are and who you are with at all times. They prevent or discourage you from seeing friends, family, or going to work or school.

* Your partner insists that you reply right away to their texts, emails, and calls, and demands to know your passwords to social media sites, email, and other accounts.

* An abusive partner may act jealous, including constantly accusing you of cheating. They may attempt to control how you spend money and your use of medications or birth control. They may make everyday decisions for you, such as what you wear or eat.

* They may be demeaning. They may put you down by insulting your appearance, intelligence, or interests. They may try to humiliate you in front of others and attempt to destroy your property or things that you care about.

* An abusive partner may act angry or have a quick or unpredictable temper, so you never know what might cause a problem. They may blame you for their violent outbursts and physically harm or threaten harm to you, themselves, and members of your household, including children or pets.

* They may hurt you physically, such as hitting, beating, pushing, shoving, punching, slapping, kicking, or biting. They may use or threaten to use a weapon against you.

* They may be sexually abusive, including rape or other forced sexual activity. They may incorrectly assume that consent for a sex act in the past means that you must participate in the same acts in the future. They may also incorrectly assume that consent for one activity means consent for increased levels of intimacy. For example, an abuser may assume that a kiss should lead to sex every time.

* An abusive partner may threaten to turn you in to authorities for illegal activity if you report the abuse, or if you resist.",2024-11-30 05:39:41,2025-03-17 16:31:34,signs

I really wanted to get this off my chest, because I saw a video of a girl reacting to a street interview where guys where asked if they should have a say in what their gfs wear, she commented saying ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt care about his opinion, why date him?‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs for yourself, why don‚Äôt you wear that at home?‚Äù

For all women who were in a similar situation and were made to believe that they are disrespecting their boyfriends or whatever, it was NEVER about just the clothing. It usually starts with such remarks because it is a gateway into other forms of control. I guarantee you, he doesn‚Äôt stop at just what you‚Äôre wearing. Today it‚Äôs that, tomorrow it‚Äôs isolation from your friends because of their ‚Äúquestionable morals‚Äù then the day after tomorrow it‚Äôs you not being able to leave your house.

Don‚Äôt let ANYONE tell you that this is about respect, it is absolutely not. You respect your partner by staying loyal, committed, putting in the necessary effort and by listening to his needs. One of these should NEVER include you tossing your warderobe away.

Think about this further, he doesn‚Äôt want you wearing certain things, because what? Because he doesn‚Äôt want you to attract other men. Because why? He thinks you want to. Because why? He thinks you‚Äôre a whore who seeks other men‚Äôs attention.

You will never convince me that it isn‚Äôt that, even on a subconcious level. 

These types of things REEK of abuse and they REEK of isolation and emotional drainage. 

Your partner is not your father, not your guardian, not anyone you need to sacrifice your autonomy for, even if it‚Äôs just to ‚Äúcover up‚Äù",2024-11-27 17:21:36,2025-03-17 16:31:37,signs

1ealm3g,Red Flags & Warning Signs of an Abuser,Think-Library9577,41,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ealm3g/red_flags_warning_signs_of_an_abuser/,"As a survivor who's been free from my abuser for two years now, I believe it‚Äôs vital to help other victims recognize the red flags that present themself in the early stages of an abusive relationship. Hopefully, this list will help someone escape before abuse escalates, or it will give them insight as to what they should look out for in a future partner. I‚Äôve compiled a list of some warning signs that I find important to have on your radar:

**Red Flags**

* *They have crappy friends.* ‚ÄúYou are who you hang around‚Äù. If someone has little-to-no friends, or their friends are disrespectful with no real life goals- it goes to show the influences someone has in their life. Who we know affects who we become, so make sure your partner has friends in their life who are kind and have aspirations.
* *They speak negatively about others.* If someone is constantly bringing others down, pointing out ‚Äúflaws‚Äù in random rangers, or bringing up drama, that‚Äôs a good indication of their heart. My ex would often make jokes about overweight people in public, and although I didn‚Äôt think it was funny, he‚Äôd say ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a joke‚Äù . If someone is degrading someone else for their lifestyle, interests, or appearance, that shows very narcissistic behavior. Also, if they‚Äôre talking negatively about strangers, their closest friends, or their family- they *will* talk shit about you.
* *They constantly brag about how good of a person they are*. My ex would always talk about himself and the ‚Äúgood deeds'' he'd do. If he left a generous tip for a waitress, you can assure he would be posting about it on Snapchat. If he went to visit his elderly grandmother, that was something that he felt the world needed to know about. Chances are, if someone is bragging about how good of a person they are, they‚Äôre actually not that good of a person. No one brags about something they do in everyday life; so if they‚Äôre showing off an act of kindness, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs rare.
* *They start being emotionally abusive*. Emotional abuse is typically the first step in DV relationships. If your partner is demonstrating speech/behavior that is degrading, belittling, controlling, punishing, or manipulative towards you, you need to exit safely as soon as possible. Abusers may start out by withholding love, refusing to speak to you, looking through your phone any chance they get, calling you names, or doing anything that tears you down. Regardless if they apologize afterwards, that doesn‚Äôt make it right. These are ways in which narcissists control and maintain power over their partner. When someone tries to control where you go, who you talk to, or what you think, they are disrespecting your right to autonomy. They‚Äôre tearing you down little by little so that they can feel bigger about themself.
* *They‚Äôre jealous*. At the beginning of a relationship, an abuser will always say that jealousy is a sign of love; jealousy has nothing to do with love, it is a sign of possessiveness and lack of trust. They may question you about who you talk to, accuse you of flirting, or be jealous of the time you spend with family or friends. As the jealousy progresses, they may call frequently during the day or drop by unexpectedly. Your partner may even try to justify this behavior by saying they are concerned with your safety or they are ‚Äújust looking out for you‚Äù.¬†
* *They invade your life very quickly.* If your partner is wanting to spend every day together, talking about marriage, kids, moving in, etc after only a short while together, that‚Äôs a huge red flag. They are pressuring you to commit to the relationship in such a way that you may later feel guilty or like you are letting them down if you want to slow down or break up. They‚Äôre trying to establish permanence in your life so it‚Äôs harder for you to get rid of them.¬†
* *They have little work ethic.* It‚Äôs important to look for a partner who has long term goals and dreams. If their mother still coddles them as an adult, they do nothing productive all day, or they have no desire to do anything that isn‚Äôt fun for them- they are going to continue that behavior in your relationship. Eventually, you‚Äôll become the one taking care of them and their needs. My ex did everything impulsively and without a solid plan, just ‚Äúhoping for the best‚Äù. (I‚Äôm not saying impulsive decisions are bad, but when it‚Äôs *every single time,* that‚Äôs a huge red flag!) He was unprepared for almost everything he got himself into, so I constantly had to take time away from what I was doing to save him. If you see that they‚Äôre not prepared for life, don‚Äôt stay. You‚Äôll just end up being a parent rather than a partner.
* *They‚Äôre impatient.* Look at how your partner behaves when they don't get their way. An abusive person will push until they get what they want, but a good person understands boundaries and will respect someones ‚Äúno"". This can be more difficult to notice in the beginning stages of a relationship, as an abuser will try to hide their emotions in the start. Pay attention to how they treat staff at restaurants, or how they speak to their mother on the phone. If they get irritable when things don‚Äôt go their way, that‚Äôs a clear indication of how they will treat you.¬†
* *They don‚Äôt deal with their emotions*. It‚Äôs important to see how someone you‚Äôre in a relationship with handles conflict. Do they run away and go silent? Do they get angry and lash out? Do they actively try to address their traumas and issues? If your partner can‚Äôt handle negative emotions, then chances are that they will take their feelings out on you.¬†
* *They say horrible things about their exes*. My ex said awful things about his ex girlfriends for no reason. He would call his exes names like: ugly wh\*res, sl\*ts, c\*nts, stupid b\*tches, etc. and say how he wanted them to die. The thing is, your ex was once someone you loved. That was someone you saw a future with... So unless your ex abused you or was legitimately crazy, why would you say such nasty things about them? My ex consistently brought up how crazy his past girlfriend was. When I was trying to escape him years later, I actually ended up contacting the ‚Äúcrazy ex‚Äù, and she was one of the sweetest girls ever who went through the same things I did. (Years later, she‚Äôs now one of my best friends).¬†
* *They don‚Äôt like your friends/family*. If your partner makes remarks or smear tactics about how they don‚Äôt like your friends or family, what they‚Äôre trying to do is isolate you from the people in your life. If I had plans with my friends, my ex would guilt me into not going nearly every time. It got to the point where I stopped being invited out because my friends assumed I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go. This is a tactic used by abusers to make it seem like your partner is your only support and no one else cares for you. If someone doesn‚Äôt love the people you love, they don‚Äôt belong in your life.
* *Your friends/family dont like them*. If the people in your life who know you most and want the best for you do not like your partner, that‚Äôs a clear indication that you have on ‚Äúrose colored glasses‚Äù. Sometimes, we struggle to see who someone really is deep down because we develop an emotional attachment. So listen to what your friends say about your partner, because they‚Äôll look at them for what they are while you‚Äôre looking at them for what you love. If your closest allies think your significant other isn‚Äôt worth the time of day, chances are they‚Äôre right.¬†
* *They don't share the same morals as you.* Shared values provide a set of guidelines that establish respect, resolve conflicts, and help make important decisions with your partner. It‚Äôs fine to disagree on some things, but couples should see eye-to-eye on major topics. Abusers either won‚Äôt share similar morals with you, or they‚Äôll just have no morals. Talk about the things you care deeply about early on.
* *They downplay your accomplishments*. If someone who is supposed to love you makes you feel guilty after you share good news with them, run. If they try to talk about their own achievements to take away from your moment, they‚Äôre trying to diminish what you‚Äôve done in order to belittle you. I remember when I graduated Salutatorian from my private highschool with honors and a 4.2 GPA, my ex told me ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs highschool, not rocket science. Anyone could do that if they just paid attention.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt even show up to my graduation. (Mind you, I was taking multiple college courses. He dropped out of highschool his senior year and got his GED at 21). He made me feel guilty for being proud of myself. No one should make you feel bad for reaching your goals. Your partner should be your biggest supporter.
* *They make empty promises*. Abusers like to make promises to their victims without any intention of ever fulfilling them. They tend to make promises when they feel they are not in control so as to give them power over something in your life. It‚Äôll start out with little things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take you to this nice restaurant‚Äù or ‚ÄúI promise to bring you flowers soon‚Äù so that they can get your hopes up, but they‚Äôll never actually follow through with their word. Eventually, these promises will turn into ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for what I said, I promise I won‚Äôt do it again‚Äù or ‚ÄúI promise I‚Äôll never lay another hand on you, I feel awful about it‚Äù. This is all a ploy to keep you from leaving them.
* *They break/strike things*. Abusers often will first show how they react when angered by taking it out on the objects around them. This behavior can be used as a punishment by breaking possessions you love, but is mostly used to terrorize you into submission. The abuser may beat on the table with their fists, throw objects at/near you, kick the car, slam doors, or drive at a high speed recklessly to scare you. Not only is this a sign of extreme emotional immaturity, but there is great danger when someone thinks they have the ‚Äúright‚Äù to punish or frighten you.

If this list can help save even one person, I‚Äôve done my job here. I encourage others to share any red flags they noticed in their own experiences in the comments. It‚Äôs important to tell our stories in order to end the culture of silence and illuminate a safer path.

1hg7lns,"Are these signs of control, or are they a combination of boundaries/preferences and concern for my safety/well-being? It's hard for me to tell. ",anonykitcat,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hg7lns/are_these_signs_of_control_or_are_they_a/,"It can be challenging for me to tell whether the following are signs of control or signs that he is trying to look out for/protect my safety and well-being. What makes me think that there are aspects of control here is the fact that he can have episodes of verbal/emotional abuse (involving: shouting/yelling, name-calling, sometimes throwing things). This doesn't happen all the time, but it can happen every few weeks or months.

* We live in a not-so-great part of town currently, so it's not a great idea for a woman to go walking alone at night. I can see the logic here, but sometimes if we have a heated argument or fight where he's shouting at me, I want to leave the apartment for a bit (even at night). He tells me not to leave at night and will get very upset if I do, saying it's not safe for me.
* He often says I am too skinny (joking about how I look like a stick/teenage boy), and tries to get me to eat more. He says it's for my health/well-being, which I can understand. However, sometimes we have gotten into arguments because he gets mad at me for not eating enough, even though I am genuinely full. He also tells me that I would be more attractive to me if I gain weight, which is *very* hard when you are naturally slender (most of the women in my family are) and have a low appetite.
* He wants me to shave/wax frequently, and I generally don't mind it, but sometimes it's exhausting and takes too much time/effort so I'll get lazy (I also have a chronic health condition making basic tasks like shaving exhausting sometimes) and shave my legs and armpits once/week and brazillian wax every few months. I also nick myself shaving a lot, and waxing gets really expensive. He's always telling me that I need to ""groom"" myself more and jokes that I'm hairy like a man.
* He has expressed that he wouldn't want me to wear certain clothes (shorts that are too short, tops too low-cut, etc). I don't like wearing these clothes either (I feel uncomfortable getting attention from random men), but I feel like if I did want to, he'd have a problem with it.
* He has a certain style that he prefers and wants me to dress. He does not *force* me to dress this way, but often expresses how he wishes I did.
* We got several arguments because I didn't want to shave my head again (I was experiencing some hair loss). I had done it before and he liked it (he thinks bald women are attractive and complimented me a lot), but then I decided I wanted to grow my hair out. He also didn't like that my hair was shedding; it grossed him out to see my hair on the ground (I vacuum/sweep twice a week, but there's still hair sometimes) and he thought if I shaved it, the problem would be solved.
* He tells me ""come here"" a lot, and if I'm in the middle of doing something (studying, cleaning, watching something on my computer, etc) he will keep saying ""come here"" with increasing irritation in his voice. He will get annoyed if I don't come and sometimes argue with me. It's often because he wants attention, but sometimes he wants help or to talk with me about something.
* He needs a lot of attention and sometimes distracts me when I need to study for my graduate program. Even if he knows I'm studying, he will sometimes make random comments or jokes, and when I ignore them he sometimes feels insulted and gets irritated. Sometimes the frequent need for attention is exhausting and I just want to be in my own world for a bit.
* He guit-trips me about making certain decisions. For example, in a long-distance relationship, I was planning to visit him in his country of origin but there was a war. I told him I was scared to go there because there were warnings against travel due to a missile strike (which ended up happening at the same time that my plane was scheduled to land), and he told me the warnings meant nothing and were over-exaggerated and threatened to dump me if I cancelled the trip.
* He does not like wearing condoms and complains about wearing them if we have sex while I'm ovulating (I am not on birth control due to health issues). He thinks I'm overreacting and the pull-out will be fine, but I want to take the extra caution.
* If I am having a conflict with a family member or friend and I vent to him about it, he will tell me how I should respond/handle the situation. Often his preferred style of handling things/responding (which often involves setting very strong boundaries and being extremely direct, sometimes telling people straight-up to f\*\*k off) is different than mine. He will get frustrated and sometimes angry with me if I don't respond or handle a situation the way he thinks I should.
* When we are apart, he calls me frequently throughout the day and wants to know where I am/what I'm doing. I don't necessarily think this in itself is controlling, but he keeps frequent tabs on my activities/location. He sometimes can get paranoid that I'm cheating.
* He gets anxious about the idea of me communicating with any male classmates/colleagues. He doesn't force me not to, but he also does not like the idea of me having male friends so I generally try to avoid all unnecessary communication with unrelated men.",2024-12-17 10:12:51,2025-03-17 16:31:42,signs

-respected my boundaries, has not been contacting me without asking permission/if it's a good time

-he has asked if I would give him another opportunity to prove himself.  He said he is committed to me and is willing to go as slow as I need over the next year or however long I would like

He's never physically hurt me, just acted intimidating throws things and puts my in vulnerable situations (ditching me places kicking me out of our house at night).  He has never been verbally demeaning.  He has never been unfaithful.

He has had a LOT of chances already, but this is the biggest blow up we have ever had and the only time I've ever actually left.

I'm not doing well without him.  I want our life back so badly.  If I walk away now and he ACTUALLY changes this time, I'll have left someone I love more than anyone and a life i really wanted, and some other girl will get that life because I gave it away.",2023-09-24 16:23:59,2025-03-17 16:31:44,signs

Did any of your friends and family see the signs and try to warn you? Was there anything that anyone who loved you could have said that would have helped you leave earlier? 

My 19 year old daughter has been in a relationship for a year with a manipulative, emotionally abusive, narcissist. It hasn't turned physical yet, but he's told her that are needs to stop speaking to and being around me (I called him out for being verbally and emotionally abusive to her and that was his response... that I'm manipulative and she needs to get away from me). 

I didn't see the signs until recently. However, absolutely everyone around her sees the signs... friends, relatives, her therapist... even her! She admits that she knows he's abusive but she ""just loves him and can't explain why."" Her therapist explained that she's trauma bonded to him and that it's like a drug and that she's hoping that one day it will go back to the way it was in the very beginning. My daughter thinks she can end things peacefully. 

Every day she says she's done with him because of how he talks to her, but he manipulates her into going back every night. She says every day, ""I should just block him,"" but she never does, and she keeps going back. I'm afraid for her future. Unfortunately, she doesn't want any advice at all. She thinks she can just handle it on her own, except she has proven every day for the past month that she can't break free. She's had several people who are close to her who have been mentally and physically abused.... she refuses to listen to any of them. Everyone, including her therapist, tells me that she's just going to have to learn the hard way. I know that women often stay in physically abusive relationships for 7 to 12 years. I don't want that for my daughter. It breaks my heart to see her constantly go back after some of the absolutely horrible things he's said to her. I can't imagine anyone thinking that deserve to be treated like that. I can't imagine continually allowing someone to talk to me the way that he talks to her. 

Is there anything at all that I can say, or do, to get her to open her eyes to the fact that her only option is to block him on everything and just start the healing process? Or is she simply doomed to a miserable life with an abusive asshole?",2024-06-01 09:05:50,2025-03-17 16:31:46,signs

1dw8dfn,Seeing signs of abusive behavior in autistic chronically ill girlfriend,bigcoatsmallworld,13,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1dw8dfn/seeing_signs_of_abusive_behavior_in_autistic/,"TW: >!Suicide and self harm !<

I(M/25) am feeling worried because it has recently come to my attention that several behaviors that I thought were intrinsic aspects of my partners conditions are considered abusive and I'm having trouble understanding if my gf(24/F) is lying to me to take advantage of me or suffering and in legitimate need of help.

We have been dating for 2 years and currently live together. My gf is autistic and has frequent meltdowns over sensory issues and plans changing. Her meltdowns can get very explosive depending on the situation. Usually she goes non verbal when melting down, but we developed a strategy for me to help her communicate. Sometimes my gf doesn't cooperate with the strategy which leaves me kind of powerless to help aside from things like turning off the lights, making sure she's comfortable, etc. Often when this happens she is insistent that I help her and if I don't help her the right way her meltdown will escalate, when they escalate usually she will scream, stomp, throw things, yell at me, throw herself into walls, hit herself in the head, and try to swallow a handful of whatever pills are nearby. I have no idea how no one has called the police as we live in an apartment complex with thin walls, but every time this happens I worry that the police will get called.

My gf also has a chronic condition that gives her mobility issues and chronic pain. I have restructured my own life to be able to help her with this as it is pretty severe. I do almost all of the house hold chores, I drive her anywhere she needs to go, I take care of her dog, and generally assist however I can. As a result of this I hardly have any time for myself. I used to see friends multiple times a week and now I have gone months without seeing them. I used to have a full time job, now I work part time and hardly make enough money. I am generally too exhausted or anxious to talk to friends online or take care of myself. Recently my sister reached out to me to tell me she was worried about me because I don't seem like myself anymore and that she is concerned because she was recently in a toxic relationship and didn't want me to follow the same path. This prompted me to start reading about abusive relationships and I felt uneasy that I recognized some of the signs in my relationship.

My gf has mentioned before that some of her behaviors could seem abusive if they were done by a neurotypical person, but they're not an abusive person they just have more needs. In my attempts to research the correlation between autism and abuse I found an overwhelming sentiment that autism is never a valid excuse for abusive behavior. I have since set a boundary that if she starts to yell at me or throw/slam things during a meltdown I will leave the room to protect my peace. She got upset when I set this boundary and left our apartment threatening suicide. Later she told me she was happy I was learning to set boundaries but upset that this would mean she wouldn't get the support they need from me during a meltdown. Since I have started utilizing this boundary she has been very unhappy and calling it unfair.

I have also noticed if I do or say something she doesn't like she often shuts down and won't participate in my attempts to talk about what is wrong. Recently she did this to me because I asked for 2 hours to myself, after about an hour and a half she started asking for me to spend time with her instead, I insisted that I was going to use all of those 2 hours to myself as I rarely get the chance. Around bed time she got upset with me and moved to the couch, I fell asleep and kept waking up throughout the night to check on her, ask if she wanted to talk, tell her I could see something was bothering her, but she kept telling me nothing was wrong. Then in the morning she broke down about how horrible I was to her for ignoring her when she needed help and that I must not care about her because she said she was going to kill herself and I just went back to sleep. I do not remember her saying she was going to kill herself at all and am worried this is gaslighting, but can't say for sure because maybe I just didn't hear her.

I feel like I'm walking on eggshells because she regularly seems to be on the brink of a meltdown. I have to be super careful to make sure that nothing remotely stressful happens to her. This leads to me being fearful of relaying any stressful information such as problems in the relationship or asking for anything I need that alters our usual routine.

When she is ramping up to a meltdown she will start demanding my help with things. I try to help but it's not always clear what she needs or how I can help. If I ask for more information or don't figure it out she gets more and more upset until it's a full on meltdown and she's yelling at me for causing it. I told her I feel like I've become responsible for regulating her emotions as a result of this, she instantly dismissed this and told me this isn't true and that I'm being mean for suggesting it.

She has issues with almost all of my friends and family. She told me how she sees signs of things she doesn't like and doesn't feel comfortable being around a lot of them. This has contributed to me feeling isolated.

She also has been sexually coercive throughout the relationship. About halfway through our relationship I started wanting sex less often(about once a week, down from 2-3 times) and she would get really upset. Any time I said I wasn't in the mood she would guilt trip me and tell me that sex is how she feels loved and me not wanting sex feels like I'm rejecting her. She would be go silent and make it obvious she was upset. As a result I often have sex despite not wanting to.

She has threatened/attempted suicide multiple times in our relationship and has told me that if I leave her or stop taking care of her she will kill herself. I feel like I can't leave her because I honestly don't think she could manage her conditions by herself and am worried she will kill herself.

For a lot of these behaviors I have just accepted it and thought to myself, this is how she operates because her brain works differently and I need to try harder to understand her or her life is more challenging due to her disability and I have been happy to try and help her. Though lately I'm starting to wonder if I'm being taken advantage of and if she's manipulating me. I also worry because as I've become more aware of abuse/manipulation tactics and tried to stand up for myself and set boundaries, the more we get into situations where she tells me I'm being abusive to her. This is making me feel crazy because I know that that in itself could be another manipulation tactic, but at the same time I wonder if I'm treating her unfairly because I am over analyzing everything and treating her as if she's being abusive when she's not? She has had meltdowns that seriously caused problems for herself so I don't think they're entirely superficial. It definitely seems like her meltdowns are really intense and maybe I just need to be less involved.

I don't know if it's fair to call any of this behavior abusive, but I'm seeking clarity and wanted to get opinions from others, especially folks with autism or chronic illness about how this sounds, if anyone else has been in a similar situation.",2024-07-05 21:01:05,2025-03-17 16:31:52,signs

But one thing that was present was this feeling of isolation done in subtle ways, so Im gonna give a few examples of what happened to me and would like to hear from you as well.

One thing that was blatant was obv disencouraging my friendships with other women. For that reason I did not go to the wedding and to the farewell party of a close friend (she did not forbid me, but she didnt want to go with me,' said she didnt like her and I ended up feeling weird about going on a trip without her, since the wedding was in other city).

Also I had a very close friend group since high school and a few other groups of friends. She got along just fine with my friends from hs,' but seemed like never liked the others. One of those groups she didnt like because they smoked weed and seemed like 'bums'. Another group that was all couples she dint like because according to her the girls treated her poorly while we were playing a table game.

So I guess I wanna hear your thoughts and your personal experience.

recently, i recounted a silly story of something i did with a former neighbor who was my age, to my daughter. growing up, all my neighbors were boys but the one boy who lived two doors down was my BFF most my childhood. shortly after having told my daughter this story, and after 20+ years of being out of contact with this neighbor‚Ä¶ he randomly pops up in my DMs. it almost felt like reminiscing of the better times manifested him back into my life, so excitedly i started talking to him. he assumed i was happily married but then i unintentionally unloaded all my life‚Äôs chaos on him and he invited me to his lake house. i agreed, and we spent the day out on the boat, catching up and then a few drinks around a fire later the evening. the way the day worked out was magical - i never thought i‚Äôd find another person i‚Äôd want to be with, but he and i connected in a way there are no words to describe. we‚Äôve been together nonstop for a few months and i couldn‚Äôt have been happier. it‚Äôs a stark contrast from where i was to where i am.

Why do I still feel so bad about myself?,ExtraGrocery,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1fccbss/recognized_the_signs_and_got_out_why_do_i_still/,"I‚Äôll try to keep this brief, but really want some support because I don‚Äôt understand some of these feelings. 

I (31F) moved cross country a few years ago to chase an abusive relationship. Once I got here was when things got bad, I let it go on because I had no friends or family anywhere near, and have been in a lot of therapy since. 

I have been acquaintances with W (42M) for about 6 months, and we started seeing each other about 6 weeks ago. The love bombing phase was great! Flowers, nice dates, lunches when I stayed over, caring, kind, the works. But caring got clingy and clingy got possessive pretty quickly. Unfortunately a few weeks in I was involved in an accident that resulted in a nasty concussion and found out my father has cancer. It started with getting possessive with the nurses at the hospital being too friendly, then not wanting me to spend time with a male friend, then telling me how to spend my day, and saying I needed to be around him whenever he was available and sleep with him every night to take care of me. 

I thought it was sweet (but a little troublesome) but when I recovered and got a better grasp on my family situation the hovering only got worse. Suddenly it was panic calling because I didn‚Äôt respond to a text in 9 minutes saying he was getting in the car to check hospitals for me, having opinions about my eating habits, just overall critical and controlling under the guise of me needing him to be responsible for me. I finally kindly let him know that while I appreciated the concern I was feeling parented and wanted a partner and would like a little space. He totally understood‚Ä¶ for about an hour. Then it was dramatics (you don‚Äôt love me all my friends were right, you need to know how bad you slipped up, you‚Äôre right I‚Äôm just a monster and I‚Äôm petty and self serving, you‚Äôre too good for me, you actually can‚Äôt take care of yourself you need me) even that I had produced a body of evidence demonstrating he did need to be responsible. I told him it was all over the top and especially since I would need to be in and out of state for my parents maybe let‚Äôs cut it here. 

But a few days later I second guessed myself. That maybe I was being a little harsh since it was coming from a place of care and reached out a few days later. He apologized, we patched things up, but I wasn‚Äôt sure that was what I wanted. I even thought maybe I should have someone who cares running my life. But when it immediately went back into telling me when I would be spending time with him I told him I had plans, and the next day said I wasn‚Äôt really up to socializing and wanted to spend a quiet night in. Again, first response was understanding. The next day it was a different story. Back to texting time limits, panic texting that he was worried about me. I told him I was totally fine just gardening and he said he was coming over. I said no, I don‚Äôt want you to and hate surprise company. He said it‚Äôs not a surprise because he was telling me. I said no, he said yes, and within 45 minutes was pounding on the door, yelling to let him in, ringing the doorbell repeatedly. I kept it locked. Eventually he left and started doing the same text whirlwind, this time including that he would never show up if I didn‚Äôt want him to even though that had happened like an hour before. 

For me this was the final straw because I realized I couldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúno‚Äù. Told him this was absolutely inappropriate and that I wasn‚Äôt going to play a game debating against him that he‚Äôs a bad person. He texted me back that he didn‚Äôt care and we left it at that. 

The thing is, I still feel bad. Bad that I didn‚Äôt notice the love bombing. And second guessed myself. And still feel like maybe I‚Äôm NOT able to take care of myself and acted cruelly to someone who was looking out for me. That from his perspective I was just this troubled thing that ditched him. I don‚Äôt think any of that is true. But I also don‚Äôt trust myself and if I over corrected. ",2024-09-09 00:11:50,2025-03-17 16:32:06,signs

I‚Äôm not sure if this will be confusing or seeing, so just bear with. I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for almost 5 years now. Over the past couple years, we‚Äôve been fighting about financial problems (I pretty much support both of us), physical affection (he wants me to be more touchy feely), lying (he constantly lies and only tells the truth when caught in multiple lies), communication (it‚Äôs now to the point where I feel like I can‚Äôt communicate to him, bc no matter what I say, he will think I‚Äôm making excuses or telling him my intentions instead of accepting responsibility for fucking up), how much I care about him, trust, and job/career stuff. In the last 2-3ish years, he‚Äôs cheated on me twice. Each time he‚Äôs said that if i were showing him more affection and giving him the attention he wanted that neither would‚Äôve happened. The first time he was just ‚Äòtalking‚Äô to the girl but the second time he had a whole relationship with her. He literally fucking her and buying this girl and her kid shit while I was over there paying all our bills and he was saying that he was sorry that he didn‚Äôt have any money to contribute to bills. He used my car to go see her and would tell me he was hanging out with friends (he doesn‚Äôt have his own car). Each time, he said it was my fault bc I was not providing something the relationship for him. Please keep in mind I provide financially (working 3 jobs to help keep us afloat), drive him to where he needs to be when I can, keep the house clean and clean and fold his laundry. I know I‚Äôm not perfect, all of those don‚Äôt happen all the time, but I try to make it happen as much as possible. In these situation, I feel like I‚Äôm already giving so much to the relationship that if I give him the attention he is craving that I‚Äôm not going to have anything left in the tank for me! (I‚Äôve really been working on the whole affection thing, it‚Äôs now to the point he Denys the affection more that seeks it 
That being said we fight quite a lot but there‚Äôs only been a handful of times that he‚Äôs gotten in my face, and pushed me. In those situations, I‚Äôve always ended up hurt in some way. He usually ends up apologizing bc he feels guilty, but saying something along the lines of, well if you wouldn‚Äôt have made me so angry, it wouldn‚Äôt have happened. About a week ago it happened again, he thought I was being disrespectful during an argument, so he got all up in my face, yelling at me (I could literally feel spit hitting my face). I told him, calmly, multiple times to get out of my face and then he shoved me super hard ‚Äòbc he was getting out of my face‚Äô. I ended up with some gnarly bruises on my arms and legs from my fall. In previous situations, I‚Äôve had my head and other body parts end up putting holes in the wall. That being said, these situations have probably happened less than 5 times over the relationship. There have been quite a few times in heated arguments he has called me a bitch or other names I‚Äôm a aware I can have a temper 
Here‚Äôs the thing, even if I‚Äôm not trying I will provoke him somehow. The other day, i picked him up from work and he was upset at me that I  didn‚Äôt get him dinner. The next day i got him dinner when I picked him up and he got upset at me for ‚Äònot knowing him‚Äô. But it was a sandwich he had gotten recently. He got upset bc ‚Äòthat‚Äôs not something he eats‚Äô but in  reality, he had literally the same sandwich last week, just with more veggies, and I just only put one veggie on.

If I would have read between the lines back then, I would have seen how he was abusing them too. Here are some things he said about them that didn‚Äôt add up. 
1. He said that both of them vindictively cheated on him and how he had scarring trust issues because of it. But it turns out, he never actually had evidence that either of them had cheated. Sure enough in my relationship with him, he irrationally accused me of cheating at every turn. 
2. He told me he dumped GF#1 because she ‚Äúgave up on the relationship‚Äù. I think she got so broken down by the abuse that she stopped being herself because of it. The same thing happened to me and I was also accused of giving up on the relationship. 
3. He blamed getting a DUI on GF#2 and said it was her fault he was drunk driving. Apparently she did not answer her phone when he called, so he said she was talking to other guys. (He offered no other explanation besides that.) So he was speeding off to her apartment to go tell her off when he was pulled over. She wasn‚Äôt talking to other guys! Whenever I didn‚Äôt answer my phone immediately he said I was talking to other guys too. 
4. He acted like fights with me were not normal arguments since I didn‚Äôt scream in his face, throw punches, and call the police. He seemed so proud of his ability to bring out reactive abuse in his victims and then call them psycho. 

And the list goes on. I wish I had noticed the problems sooner.",2023-02-17 19:34:04,2025-03-17 16:32:10,signs
1czmvv1,I think I was in an abusive relationship‚Ä¶how did I miss the signs?,Designer-Diet-3450,7,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1czmvv1/i_think_i_was_in_an_abusive_relationshiphow_did_i/,"Hello everyone,

I‚Äôve been out of this relationship for a few years and am just starting to put the pieces together that it may have been abusive (probably because I recently moved far away from where he was). I‚Äôm looking for support and affirmation if it is the case. Not sure why it‚Äôs taken so long, it was an ongoing unhealthy friendship/relationship for most of my 20s but we seriously dated for almost 4 years. I‚Äôm realizing the shell of a person I became and my confidence feels so low.

Here‚Äôs some of the things that happened while dating:

-He made me clean my apartment regularly because it wasn‚Äôt good enough for him. He would watch me and call his friends and laugh about it.

-Told me he wanted me to have a bigger butt, ‚Äúit would be nice.‚Äù 

-He wanted me to speak in a certain tone and would make a gesture with his hands almost touching my face if I didn't.

-Tried to work with me on my smile so it seemed more genuine (up until we dated I was complimented from friends & even strangers a lot on what a nice smile I had). 

-Make fun of me in the presence of others. Even after I told him it hurt me.

-Vent to his friends about me when he had an issue with me. But he would refuse to speak to me about these issues when I asked, but he always told me when he ‚Äútold Steve about what happened with you‚Äù. I became the black sheep in that friend group and could not understand why.

-Seemed jealous about my relationship with my best friend- when he met her and her partner he made passive aggressive comments the whole weekend.

-He would say things like, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to see me upset‚Äù if I did something that irked him

-Sexually, he would shut down if we crossed a line that involved touching me but had no issue with me touching him. Not sure if this is religious-based because we were Christians at the time.

-Made comments about my clothing being inappropriate, wanting me to cover up more.

-Said things like ‚Äúway to go superstar‚Äù when I made a mistake

-Told me I‚Äôm a walking target and people will take advantage of me, so I need him around.

-Told me his family is better than mine...multiple times.

-Said he wanted to help me with finances and would look at mine here and there.

-He held me down while driving because I was looking to see if cars were coming while waiting for a turn (yes I can be a backseat driver) and blocked his view. He whipped me back in the seat and held me there for a minute, even after he made the turn. When I told him I didn‚Äôt like that, he said he did not understand what the big deal was...I blocked his view. 

-I broke up with him. After that, he reached out multiple times for a year with the sweetest messages. He also spoke to my friends while at church about what happened on his side of the break up (I just learned this from said friend).


How did you process your situation? How do you heal? I feel as though I have nobody that would believe me other than my therapist. We have a lot of mutual friends who do not see him in the same light as I do. ",2024-05-24 15:03:52,2025-03-17 16:33:10,signs

I was frustrated that, like usual, my calls went unanswered, so I finally made a decision to use the substitute ingredient.
I struggled to hold back tears the whole way home as I was worried what the reaction would be.....did I make the wrong choice?

When I got home, I was rudely told that he didn't care what I chose for dinner and he is annoyed that I keep ringing him to ask, but he also wasn't happy about the substitute ingredient and it would have been better to pick something else to cook.

Well now that I am out I can plainly see it, and I hope anyone in doubt can see it too. 
1. Walking on eggshells- my partner always said that he relished in my honesty and the way I could always speak my mind, but deep down I felt that wasn‚Äôt really true. After a few episodes of explosive anger that seemed unjustified and made no sense, I started to be very cautious about everything I said and did out of fear of getting that reaction again. I started to feel very uneasy because I recognized that he never had a legit reason to get so aggressive or cold towards me- it just happened, and his only explanation (when I got one) was that it was something I had done. 
2. Brutal criticism- I noticed that before anything had even gone wrong my partner was extremely critical towards me and pointed out that our relationship could be better if I did x, y, and z. I was very surprised because I had been so accommodating at that point and let him run the relationship to keep him happy. But even then he said I was not listening to him, making multiple mistakes, and kept pointing out faults in me that I didn‚Äôt even agree with. He acted like he was a great and patient guy to be able to overlook my blatant shortcomings. 
3. Hot and cold- he went from wanting to marry me for being the perfect woman to wanting to break up with me because my selfishness and toxic tendencies could not be forgiven. In the course of a day he would totally change his mind. And he switched his mood always after I refused to or couldn‚Äôt meet one of his demands. He was quick to say ‚ÄúWell I guess I was wrong about you after all‚Ä¶‚Äù 
4. Even from the start he expected to be my only priority. I felt nervous anytime I had to address another priority of mine because I knew he would get angry and label me as selfish and accuse me of losing interest in him.
5. Snap judgements- he never wanted to hear my explanations about anything and would assign a reason for my actions. It was always something like ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt do this because you don‚Äôt care about me.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúYou responded in this manner because you wanted to get a rise out of me.‚Äù He always made snap judgements about me that were brutally negative, and then I would always be trapped trying to explain it wasn‚Äôt like that.

Never before in history have people had something to go to in complete privacy and anonymous.

BUT

it's not accurate. It shows quotes that no one outside of a soap opera would say. Sometimes abusers might just straight up come out with abuse, but that's only usually during arguments because they know you'll excuse them because ""I'm so sorry, I was really angry and I didnt mean it. You're not _____, you're beautiful/ smart"".

It's the daily life sniper abuse these resources miss because abusers do that clever.

For example (and I'll only speak on my relationship because I won't speak over others): 

A website will say ""you look fat in that"", but my ex would pick a day where I'm happy and he would look at me while I was in the shower (he had a thing about ""keeping me company"") or getting dressed. He would say ""you know I was thinking, we are both putting weight on because we've been eating so good lately. Maybe we should both go on a diet"". He would then proceed to do absolutely nothing while focusing on my ""progress"" and making sure I go to the gym every single day. He said nice things about my body but ONLY when I was doing one meal and a day and 2+ hours at the gym. I looked like a bikini model but felt like üí© (no, its not the case for every fit person, this is my experience).

A website will say ""who are you with? What are you doing? No you can't go out"". But my ex would say ""who are you with? I get separation anxiety and I worry about you. Let me know if any random lads turn up, you've been through things before and I want you to be protected this time."" I'd even have to phone him when I was at my mom's because of his ""separation anxiety"", so I stopped nothing going out in the end. At the time I felt bad for him.

A website will say ""you're lying. That didn't happen"". My ex would say ""no I think you're confused. That's what happened that other time, but this time this happened. I think you're getting the two mixed up. Your mom's always telling you you're ditsy and I think she's right. It's ok though, it happens. Let's forget about it now"". When I knew full 100% fact I was right. If I'd then go further, he would BLOW UP and make me believe I started it because he was being ""nice"".

I could go on for days with examples. In arguments he would just flat out call me names, a liar and accuse me of things. But like I said, they know they can make you feel bad for them after and forgive them. But in daily life they can sneak in abuse and you will have 0 clue that it's abuse because they do it so nicely.

What are you going to do? Leave because he told you you should both go on a diet together? That's absurd! But it's not, he is actually manipulating you.

I'm only descovering this now I'm 5 months free. I left because he said ""stop crying. I never laid a finger on you and you should be grateful!"" After he screamed at me in public for not backing him up in mouthing off at the checkout girl. Why I should have left is because a few months into our relationship he said ""you're too much like your dad and I feel like I'm fcking him sometimes. You're too close with your family. You're 16 now, you need to be free"". I thought he was empowering me, but he was actually cutting me away from everyone.

   I found myself in a horribly abusive relationship. I don‚Äôt know how I got there, and I never thought I‚Äôd be dumb enough to stay with someone like that. 

  I guess I just wanted to tell everyone to follow their gut. (Leave early and don‚Äôt feel guilt) & that there‚Äôs online resources to help. No one sets out to date a monster and little things can become big things. Wanting to move in early, yelling due to stress, etc.

 ‚ÄúLove bombing‚Äù is what you know in your mind to be ‚Äútoo good to be true.‚Äù If the person you‚Äôre seeing breaks this facade trust your instincts. 

A brief hopefully helpful summary of things that helped me to leave.

Facts: 

 Statistically if someone puts their hands on your throat they are more likely to kill you. Read that again. It‚Äôs your life at risk. I didn‚Äôt think the person I was seeing would escalate like they did.

 Constantly putting you down and telling you there are things wrong with you is manipulation to make you feel insecure and powerless. 

  Smashing things,slamming things, throwing things, clenching fists, and yelling will escalate into much more. They are trying to intimidate you.

 Stalking has a 40% increase in the person becoming violent. If you live with someone them having to know your whereabouts constantly is a huge problem. As is controlling everything you do. What you wear, your appearance, etc.

  You can go on record with police without pressing charges if you are in fear for your life.  Your abuser won‚Äôt know. But in my experience I should have told the cops everything early on. If you find yourself needing to talk to cops to feel safe, re-assess. Your gut instinct is screaming at you. 

  Minimize, deny, blame. That is the most classic example of how someone will get away with increasingly awful behavior. No one starts out at an extreme. They will do little things to see what they can get away with. Those insults they‚Äôre hurling and control of little things will escalate. 

 If you know someone in an abusive relationship know that they are not themselves. There is a systemic approach to eroding the self esteem of this person. 

  Help them see a counselor. Show them an abuse wheel. & I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs professionally recommended but Reddit/abusiverelationships helped me to see trends in behavior. Thank you guys. 

 Also have compassion. Know that no one willingly would go into that situation. They were most likely looking for love and acceptance and abusers knows that.",2020-08-10 16:37:49,2025-03-17 16:33:31,signs

For me, he went through my phone when I was sleeping in the first few weeks, and accused me of cheating, I thought we talked about it and everything was fine.  Then he went on a work trip, called me  and texted me a bunch about it, even talking about how he's my boyfriend, then looked up escorts and strip clubs an hour later & gave me an STD when he got back.  

He wanted to move in together early too.  A few weeks after meeting/seeing each other.  He was pushing for us to get an apartment together.

I'm also not sure if he rages less now, from the new prescriptions they have him trying, or because i know when to not engage or ignore, to not have it come out?

- the prescriptions. He says he hasn't noticed anything different or not each time they add/change prescriptions.

- years of working out. We worked out together for years, each lost a lot of weight. i got in a car accident, stopped working out, he did too.",2024-02-24 16:05:00,2025-03-17 16:33:38,signs

We still live together since we own a house together. We put the house up for sale a few months ago and my ex took down the ‚Äúfor sale‚Äù sign. He told me that he saw our realtor come by and take away the sign. I called the realtor and recorded the phone call and he said he did not take down the sign. After confronting my ex, he said that I took down the ‚Äúfor sale‚Äù sign. I paid for most of the house and want my money back so I would never take it down. I want the house to sell. This means my ex took down the ‚Äúfor sale‚Äù sign. 

My car registration expired so I checked my glovebox and saw that it was empty. The registration, insurance and title to the car is missing. I didn‚Äôt take any documents out of my car. My passport is also missing.

I can‚Äôt prove my ex stole my belongings from me because my parents said I could have misplaced them. There‚Äôs no direct evidence pointing to my ex but circumstantial evidence definitely points to him.

I feel like I‚Äôm going insane because I know I didn‚Äôt take anything out of my glovebox or move my passport. The house is still on Zillow but it‚Äôs annoying that he took down the sign. It doesn‚Äôt help that my parents make excuses for my ex and ALWAYS blame me for everything. I‚Äôve tried so hard to get my parents in my corner and told them everything my narc ex has ever done to me and they either aren‚Äôt listening or don‚Äôt care.

Should I stay quiet and apply for a new registration, passport, and ask the realtor to replace the ‚Äúfor sale‚Äù sign? I would like to call police but don‚Äôt want to be gaslit by them or perceived as the crazy ex. Thoughts?",2023-10-13 14:05:55,2025-03-17 16:33:41,signs

She got married 2 years back, she had a thriving career in our country and her then boyfriend was living in another country for work and had a not so great career, has debt and mostly nothing promising for future either.

I am not sure how however my friend decided to quit her career here and start from scratch there where he was living, she couldn't use her 5yrs of experience there as the field doesn't hire immigrants for the roles. It took her 4 months and loads of stress and struggle to find a basic bare minimum paying job there. She had her savings from previous job and those got exhausted in this drill, she also took her husband on a vacation from her saving. Now she is doing a second job as well, all of this just because she feels that he should not be deprived of happiness that he finds in his choice of being there however she is okay letting go of her career that she loved. Trust me she is so capable that if they move back here, her salary can keep a family of 4 adults running fine. 

Before getting married she was kept hanging by this guy, on bare minimum and ignored always, if it was not for her, he would have never ever taken any step towards her, he took her for granted always and I have seen her anxious and crying most of the time when she was allmost dating him as he was giving her a cold shoulder yet not letting her go entirely. She was highly depressed during those years, crying most of the time and being obsessed about him. 

After repeated attempt he finally said yes to marrying her and told her that even he loves her just that he is not that expressive (that's how she tells us) she justifies all of his disrespect (in front of in-laws as well), mockery, subtle taunts and more as his inability to communicate, which she further justifies as a result of him not having much friends growing up.

When I asked her recently as to why she loves him, she took a while to think, first she said she doesn't know why she feels so strongly for him and then said because he is straight forward. She didn't had anything to say about how he adds into her life or makes it better. I found that alarming. Again i know people marry for different reasons but she is someone who is full of empathy and kindness and she expects emotional intimacy which he rarely brings and she agrees on that. 

That's one part, second part being, she talks repeatedly and highly of her mom, justifying how mother's biased treatment of her brother and her is bec of conditioning and her mom is too good at heart otherwise. She repeatedly tells about how her mom is an amazing person and a victim because her father doesn't help her mom in the house, she feels deeply for her mother and always wants to save her and stand up for her against the patriarchal system of the family, despite this her mother continues treating her son and daughter differently and highly believes in serving men of the family.

 I have been at her home and finding her mother mocking and taunting her over small things. So not my place but I have a feeling that her mother likes to be the victim and get attention and sympathy from her. 

I understand that this is not my palce to analyse this or find connections between these 2 people that she always talks so highly of repeatedly, even when she is high,  however this does feels like she is more of trying to convince herself that these are good people rather than expressing it to us. What eats me is the existence of 2 possibilities, either she has a great mother and partner or these 2 people that she looks up to so much are feeding off her. 

I fear for her safety and future but i know i cannot do anything about it unless it's actually happening and she calls it out. I am venting here because I am looking to understand if I am over analysing or can this be dangerous for her.",2023-10-31 10:42:38,2025-03-17 16:33:47,signs

k1iixy,Signs you should leave your relationship,stopquaking,55,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/k1iixy/signs_you_should_leave_your_relationship/,"These are some signs I wish I would have listened to when I was younger. I was in a really toxic relationship with I was 18 with someone 5 years older than me but I didn't leave because my relationship didn't show signs of being an abusive relationship. My partner never hit me or even yelled at me and it wasn't an abusive relationship (I think), so I thought I had to stay. Please listen to me, if your relationship shows any of these signs then you need to LEAVE immediately. It doesn't matter that maybe it's not full blown abuse, its still toxic, and you don't deserve to be in a toxic relationship.

1) This relationship functions completely differently to all your other relationships: In a bad relationship everything feels different, this person feels different, normal 'rules' about relationships don't apply to them.  Your relationships with other people, like your friends, feel easy and uncomplicated but everything about your relationship with this person is complicated and confusing, and not in a good way. 

2) you can't be yourself at all: with your friends you notice that you can basically do what you want, say what you want, express yourself however you want (with a few very minor exceptions here and there obviously) and you know nothing bad will happen if you do. In good relationships you feel safe and loved, unconditionally. In a bad relationship its the exact opposite, you can't do anything without getting into trouble for it. The love you receive from this person is incredibly conditional and they're always leaning towards seeing you in a bad light when nobody else you know sees you like that. Every time you express yourself, go out somewhere, disagree with them etc you get made to feel incredibly guilty, like you've done something terrible. Eventually you stop being yourself in order to minimize these guilt trips.

3) You get guilt tripped all the time: Your partner is always talking about how you've hurt them by something you've done, or even accuses you of things you haven't done/puts words in your mouth. Your partner has called you selfish, narcissistic for doing things that none of your other friends would be bothered by, like going out partying, respecting a boundary, or something innocuous like that. Your partner does this so much that you always feel like you're a horrible person, or may even think that you're abusing them, even though you have good intentions and none of your other friends feel abused by you.

4) You are scared of them: You get a bolt of fear deep in your stomach every time you see them, this person terrifies you and you don't like being around them, its because you know the experience with them is going to be terrible and they're going to make you feel bad.

5) You feel like you have no choice but to be in a relationship with them: In a good relationship you should feel free to leave it if its not working out or you don't want to be in it and not feel guilty. In a bad relationship this option is taken from you, your partner might guilt trip you heavily and insinuate that they need you and you believe that they might self harm or even kill themselves if you leave them.    Nobody should emotionally blackmail someone into staying with them, we are not entitled to people's love and affection.

6) No matter what you do they're never happy, its never good enough: Sometimes even your partner might ask you to do one thing, then when you do it, get upset and ask you why you didn't do the exact opposite. No matter how much of yourself you give up to please them, even when you're a shell of the person you used to be and your entire life revolves around making them happy, they still will think of you as selfish and your efforts not good enough. 

7) They put you down/have a low opinion of you: Your partner makes jokes about you that are degrading or humiliating. In my case, my partner often complained a lot about hipsters and millennials and how pretentious they were, and  then he would refer to me as a hipster in separate conversations. When I pointed out that they were always associating me with a group of people they constantly insulted I was dismissed. Because they were older than me I was constantly dissed for my age as well, I was often called a millennial, another group they insulted, and when I pointed out to them that actually technically I'm gen z and they're a millennial, I was dismissed again.  

8) You're scared to reach out to friends/family: Because you're scared that maybe they'll think you're the abuser, but also you're scared of getting into trouble because your partner has made you feel like telling anyone about your relationship is the worst thing in the world and something only someone horrible would do. 

9) You feel miserable and hopeless: You feel like you are lacking in hope, that things will never get better, because deep down, you feel trapped. You are trapped, in a toxic relationship. When you're with this person you're never happy, or you're rarely happy. 

10) You feel like your life doesn't belong to you anymore: Because it doesn't. Your entire life has narrowed down to just this one person and doing what they want, in my case because they made me feel like I was a terrible person if I didn't. You might have even given up on living your life for yourself completely, just completely putting it into someone else's hands to do what they want with it. This is because doing this minimises the toxic behaviours/abuse slightly more than sticking up for yourself and you're tired. You think maybe if you just hand over everything and stop being yourself completely they'll finally leave you alone/approve of you. They won't. 

11) The relationship is really hypocritical: You go out of your way to say the right thing, do the right thing, are always expected to apologise, but your partner says whatever they want, does whatever they want, and doesn't really apologise. Your partner thinks you're being ridiculous/sensitive when you point out something they've been doing that upsets you, yet they are incredibly sensitive to any criticism and you have to walk on eggshells to avoid starting an argument. The worst part is your partner always tells you that you're doing the opposite, that you're tactless, selfish, that you never think before you speak.

12) You argue all the time: And you never ever win any of them. Your partner starts a new argument almost every week, or even more than that. These are over things they think you've done wrong, the arguments can get dragged out for days and always have to end up with you apologising, Even when you do apologise, especially early on, your partner will still want to grill you over and over how you hurt them and how you did something wrong, and will still sometimes drag it out over multiple days. When I would actually start to win an argument my partner would breakdown, would tell me that they were literally shaking and tell me to please stop with the arguing. I was compared to a dog with a bone, and told I was obsessed with winning after one argument where for once I decided that I wasn't going to just let them win and apologise to them for something I didn't think I'd done wrong.

There's probably more but these are the main ones that come to mind. Writing this out makes me realise my relationship was actually probably more abusive than I thought. Geez. Anyways sorry this is SUPER SUPER long, but hopefully somebody reads it and realises its their relationship, that even though their partner doesn't scream or yell or throw things and seems like a really good person, it doesn't mean they should stay with them. It doesn't matter if they're an abuser or not, you don't have to figure it out, but you have to get out because being in a relationship like this will kill you.

I got out, had a year or two lag where the events sort of spiralled through me, and now I can say that I'm doing okay. I'm happy. You can be happy too, you can get out, as long as they aren't controlling your finances or threatening your life then its easier than you think. Get out, get out, get out.

Because of that, I prided myself on having a finely attuned narcissistic traits radar. Nothing could get past me... or so I thought.  

Enter: quiet BPD. 

My partner was the complete opposite of my dad. Loving, caring, compassionate, understanding, engaged in individual therapy and a big fan of meditation and self-reflection. Took responsibility for his divorce. Was a wonderful dad to his children.  

Yes, there was a love-bombing phase in the beginning, but I thought it was just that I had finally met my soulmate. I now realize that the love-bombing was mediated by the fact that he had children, and for their sake we couldn't rush into moving in together or getting married, which we absolutely would have if they were not a factor.  

We even preemptively went to couples therapy, where the therapist loved us and had full faith in us as a couple. My friends and family adored him.  

About 2.5 years in, the red flags quietly emerged (noticeable to only me), but at that point I was so confident that I knew this person's heart like it was my own, that I started to believe the conflict in the relationship was my fault. I started to believe the things he was telling me, like that he always did more for me than I did for him, and like that I was selfish and defensive.

I believed in us so much that we decided to have a baby together. The first month that we tried, I secretly panicked and considered buying Plan B. But I didn't. The second month that we tried, I got pregnant, which is when the emotional and verbal abuse kicked into full gear. It continued to escalate until I finally decided that I was done for good, after he threw me and baby out for the second time.  

My point of this post is to encourage you all to forgive yourselves. We all have unique histories that influence how we interpret our worlds. Other people may never understand, and that's ok. If you haven't left the relationship yet, I'm happy that you've arrived at this sub. I do think it's the first step toward enlightenment and ultimately leaving the relationship.

I've left my relationship and have been thinking about various warning signs throughout that I ignored (stupidly). I just feel really confused because part of me misses her, even though I know I shouldn't...

A few being that within the first few weeks of seeing my now ex she:

‚Ä¢Told me that she ""always fucks things up"" in relationships, and she hoped she ""doesn't fuck things up with me, too.""

‚Ä¢Said to me she was ""worried she'd hurt \[me\]"" and she ""really doesn't want \[me\] to get hurt.""

‚Ä¢That same night, she came over to my house drunk, belittled me, called me names, tried to humiliate me, spit on my sofa, and then demanded to ""take a nap"". When I told her ""no"" and that she had to leave and that I'd walk her home, she said ""if you wake me up, I will hit you"" and then seemingly instantly, passed out. Mind you, we'd known each other for just a month at this point.

**Even though she was drunk, was her threat to hit me a sign that she would be physically abusive later on? Is being drunk an excuse for this type of behavior because she was just, well, drunk? Or is it a sign of their true self coming out?**

In fact, as time went on, she did become more physically abusive, all usually when ""drunk"". However, despite being ""drunk"", she would at first deny many things she did, but then would later acknowledge that she remembered doing those things - so were you really ""drunk"" at all? You are still in control, and making decisions, I'd assume if you then remember and acknowledge the things you did... Right?

One time, she admitted after a drunken incident that she ""wanted to see how far she could push me...to see how much I could take."" That sounds pretty intentional to me...

**I just find the whole thing really confusing. Why would someone do that to me?**

**Things she did later in our relationship when ""drunk"":**

\-Kicked her legs at me during a *tantrum*

\-Biting me at a convenience store so hard my shoulder turned purple

\-Throwing objects while I was nearby out of ""frustration"" (never thrown at me, just near me - it did frighten me, though). This happened twice.

\-Groping me when I told her no.

\---

I'm just so confused by the way she acted. It was horrible and made me so uncomfortable.

I know I had to leave, because she was also very emotionally abusive to me, too.

**I just don't know what the real her was?**

One of the last things she said to me before I broke up with her for good was she said that she **""likes toxic relationships, she likes the drama... it's exciting.""**

**Does that mean she liked doing these things to me the whole time?**",2023-03-09 22:58:17,2025-03-17 16:33:54,signs

He was incredibly sweet and charming. Invited me over and cooked me a nice dinner and we had a great time. 

So we started hanging out on the weekends. And I‚Äôd stay there on my days off. By the third week things were getting kind of odd. 

He started a new job. We woke up and he took off to work. We texted throughout the day and I told him I‚Äôd have supper ready when he got home. He tells me he‚Äôll be back at 6. 

Messaged him around 5 to tell him I started supper and that I hope he‚Äôs had a good day. He says alright and that he‚Äôs about to leave. 

6:30 rolls around, supper has been done for about 30 mins, he‚Äôs not home. I text him to see if he‚Äôs almost here and he says he left a little later than he wanted to but he‚Äôll be home soon. 

8 rolls around, still not home. I text him and he tells me he decided to go to the bar with his new coworkers. 

Which I thought was really odd because he didn‚Äôt say anything about it when he was about done with work. I was a little bit bothered. But I just said that I was glad to hear he‚Äôs getting along with his coworkers and to be careful on the way home. He said he‚Äôd be home soon. 

At this point I‚Äôm pretty bothered. It‚Äôs about 11pm now and he starts sending me snaps of him driving/music playing. But this is where my alarm bells really went off. 

When he gets home he‚Äôs mad at me for not being shitty towards him. He told his coworkers that I was blowing his phone up trying to get him to come home and for some reason he wanted that to be true because he wanted an excuse to leave. He said it seemed like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt give a shit.‚Äù 

He worked the next day. He was home when he said he‚Äôd be that day. But when he got home he told me he was planning on taking my car but couldn‚Äôt find my keys. I didn‚Äôt tell him anything about being able to drive my car, and I would‚Äôve said no because I didn‚Äôt wanna be stuck at his house. So that was another red flag. 

There was another time where he said I had said something racist, I think it was a day or two after the supper incident. Usually I‚Äôm pretty conscious about that kind of thing and he wouldn‚Äôt tell me what I said because ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt worth arguing over‚Äù even though we weren‚Äôt arguing. Took my by surprise but thinking back there‚Äôs nothing that could even be taken that way that I said to him. I think he knew it would bother me if I had said something and he just wanted it to get under my skin. 

He also wanted to be official really fast but also didn‚Äôt wanna be open about our relationship. 

Anyways I stopped going over there. Didn‚Äôt give much of an explanation because I feel like he just thrived on trying to fuck with me, because that‚Äôs what abusers do. He tried to accuse me of stealing things from his house too after he was sure I wasn‚Äôt coming back. 

Just glad to be able to spot these things pretty quickly. A couple small incidents while an abuser is trying to get a feel for how far they can take it is all I need to know I need to drop him like dead weight.",2023-03-17 17:38:52,2025-03-17 16:33:58,signs

But then he replied with ‚Äúdo you ever stop spiraling? Omfg‚Äù So I stopped. I was silent. Then he came out of the room upstairs and began huffing about how he couldn‚Äôt do this anymore. And then he finally came into the room I was in. I hadn‚Äôt said anything to him at that point besides what was on the texts. I told him he should leave the room because things were starting to get emotionally charged. He got more upset and then punched a hole in the wall. 

This isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs put a hole in the wall in our home. So that really ripped me a new one and I went into the room to confront him. That was my first mistake. To let it keep escalating. But he‚Äôs broken the door, the walls, the window on my old car..

So we get into it. By this point we‚Äôve been physically fighting each other weekly. But tonight, he grabbed me by the neck, and I felt him squeeze tighter. Like he actually wanted to do it. Then he lifted his other hand to put both of them around my throat. 

It started to feel really serious then. 

I was able to get out of his grasp and I started to cry. It feels pathetic to cry now because we‚Äôre both fighting each other. 

But we also had our baby in the room. And he woke up and started to wail. And everything just felt doomed. It has been for a while. 

I don‚Äôt think this story will end well for us. ",2024-09-25 01:32:49,2025-03-17 16:34:01,strangle
1hg24j4,My Husband Strangled Me Over a Menu Item in Front of Our 3-Year-Old ‚Äî I Finally Escaped and Called the Cops,Own_Yam2847,204,71,https://i.redd.it/s5jo64fs0c7e1.jpeg,"Yesterday, we started fighting over something so insignificant: a menu item. He gaslit me, saying it didn‚Äôt exist, and the tension escalated. He came home angry, bringing me food I said I didn‚Äôt want. It seems he had a flat tire on his Kia and didn‚Äôt want to deal with it, so instead, he unleashed everything on me for ‚Äúnot listening‚Äù and told me to ‚Äújust order something on the fucking menu.‚Äù

When he got home, it spiraled. He began packing my things, taking both keys, throwing slurs, and threatening to leave. I asked him if he was drunk, and his response was chilling: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you later.‚Äù He‚Äôs a demon when he drinks. I started recording the argument to vent on Reddit, and that‚Äôs when everything exploded.

He slapped the phone out of my hand, broke it, and got on top of me. In front of my 3-year-old daughter, he beat me repeatedly and strangled me, demanding I delete the videos. I started deleting whatever I could to get him to stop. I convinced him to let me go upstairs, saying I‚Äôd ‚Äúdelete the Reddit posts there.‚Äù As I was walking up, he put me in a chokehold so tight I could barely breathe. I faked logging into Reddit, deleting things, and trying to calm him down.

But it didn‚Äôt stop. He punched me again when I tried talking him down. Desperate, I said, ‚ÄúI would never call the cops; you know me,‚Äù trying to get him to let me go. That‚Äôs when he finally stopped.

I waited for an opening. The second he mentioned looking for my phone upstairs, I grabbed it, ran as fast as I could, and hid in a neighbor‚Äôs garage. I was terrified but managed to call the police. I was so shaken I called friends to help reach 911, too.

The police came, and for the first time in a long time, I felt relief. But instead of support, his mother got pissed that I called the cops. Her first words? Not, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù Not concern for me or her granddaughter. Instead: ‚ÄúNow we have to pay for a lawyer. Now we have to pay for bail.‚Äù

There‚Äôs been a long history of abuse. His parents know it‚Äîthey‚Äôve known it‚Äîbut they enable him. They‚Äôve said he‚Äôs ‚Äútrying to get better.‚Äù Enough is enough.

Now, I‚Äôm staring down divorce, child support, alimony, and an uphill battle while his parents attack me for spending money on my nails and lashes. Your son strangled me in front of your grandchild, and this is what you‚Äôre upset about?

And to top it off, his mom tells me, ‚ÄúHe secretly told us he wanted a divorce last week because you control the finances and blackmail him.‚Äù That‚Äôs laughable. I‚Äôve begged for a divorce, but he always fake-packs, leaves for a bit, and comes back because he refuses to deal with banking or anything else.

I‚Äôm done. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be free, but I am. I know the road ahead won‚Äôt be easy, but I can‚Äôt keep enabling him anymore.",2024-12-17 03:56:15,2025-03-17 16:34:03,strangle

He had choked me maybe once or twice in the past, but not this bad.. 

When he puts his hands on me last night I remember first thinking that there was no way he was actually going to choke me‚Ä¶ right? Then the pressure on my neck became greater. A chokehold turned into a headlock. 

I remember half way thinking ‚Äúoh my god I might actually die. How do I even get out of this?‚Äù I remember frantically looking for a way to get him off me while simultaneously trying not to exert too much energy so I didn‚Äôt completely lose oxygen.. 

And the worst part is, he says he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt remember‚Äù ‚Ä¶ how convenient right? I called the cops after and now he‚Äôs mad at me for ‚Äúruining his life‚Äù ‚Ä¶ what a joke. As if I somehow forced him to choke me out. 

 It‚Äôs hard because i unfortunately care about this person even though he‚Äôs dangerous. Unfortunately it hurts my heart to hear him cry even though his actions dug his own grave. 

No matter how much I love him though I am never going back. I refuse to die at the hands of this man. Or any man for that matter. 

The only regret I have is not leaving sooner. I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this but it doesn‚Äôt get better. It will never get better. You cannot love these men into being better. These men are not wired the same as you and me, or people with any empathy. 

I remember during some of our worst fights I would literally wish for him to hit me, because then I‚Äôd have indisputable ‚Äúproof‚Äù that couldn‚Äôt be twisted by any form of gaslighting‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt be like me. Please. I could‚Äôve taken my last breath last night. And you‚Äôre probably thinking ‚Äúhe‚Äôd never do that to me‚Äù ‚Ä¶ yeah, I thought that too. 

The truth of the matter is if he‚Äôs hitting or breaking things around you, YOU ARE NEXT. It is NOT if, it is when. ",2024-12-22 15:07:58,2025-03-17 16:34:05,strangle

I'm also having cardiac problems that I can't seem to pinpoint the cause of, which may be unrelated. Can strangulation even cause heart problems? I don't even know.

He didn't even strangle me for that long. I never lost consciousness. But I think if not on a physical level, emotionally something in me changed that day. I was terrified of him, of what he would do. He put his hands on me and I knew then if I stayed with him it would be the end of me.

I feel like a failure since then. Like I can't learn things the same, or do work the same, like I'm weaker and worse off permanently. I think something in me died that day and sometimes I really mourn who I was before meeting him, long before he ever put his hands on me.

13hzcbz,My fianc√© strangled me. I know I need to leave.,Wanderment1334,97,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/13hzcbz/my_fianc√©_strangled_me_i_know_i_need_to_leave/,"I'm posting this on a throwaway account- I don't want to be defined by this. I am embarrassed, upset, scared, and I guess I'm just looking for some support that I am doing the right thing. It has been about a month since this happened. I want to clarify that I am not perfect or innocent in any way. I have said mean things during arguments and I know I am wrong for that. We are engaged and have been together for over four years. We have two children, both toddlers. I'm 27 years old and so is he. For what it's worth, I am 5'0 and 110lbs and he is almost 6'0 and 210lbs-- I just wanted to put that in here incase anyone is curious if I have defended myself. I have tried. But he is much bigger than me and I wouldn't be able to defend myself against him if I really needed to.

We were arguing over something miniscule- I can't remember what, I'm sorry. I said that I needed to leave so that we could calm down. I didn't want things to escalate even further. I brushed his shoulder while I was walking out and I know it was wrong. I can't remember if I did it on purpose or not. As soon as I got to the door to walk out, my body was lifted off the ground. I couldn't fight back or scream because I couldn't breathe or move. I think I froze in fear in the beginning of it but I do vaguely remember putting my hands over his while they were on my throat. It only took maybe 10 seconds before everything started going black. It happened very fast and I couldn't have fought him off if I tried. Right when I was about to pass out, he dropped me. I was so dizzy and out of it that my head hit the ceramic tile leaving a huge bruise and bump. I don't really remember what was said but I ran to the bathroom and rested on the floor. I can't remember going to sleep that night or anything so I don't remember him apologizing or anything.

Nothing has happened since then. No fighting, arguments, physical abuse, or anything. He's apologized for it a million times but I know the statistics. I know what happens to women like me when we don't get out. I know what I need to do. He's sorry for strangling me and he'll be sorry for killing me. I don't work because I'm a stay at home mom. I know my parents would let me and the kids stay with them but I'm just so embarrassed. The younger version of me would've never allowed this to happen and I don't know how I got here. He's busted my lip in the past- maybe 6 or so months ago. He's ripped the shower curtain down when I was showering and while he flung it around, it hit me in the face. He claims that never happened but it did. He tells me if I wouldn't make him so angry that this shit wouldn't happen. I feel like a fucking idiot writing all of this out because the red flags are everywhere. I am too involved in true crime to play coy to how this ends. And here I am wanting to say that he is a good guy and a very loving partner- but how can I say that while writing this post? I'm an idiot.

I can't just call the police. He IS the police. We live in a small county and he knows every other officer. He knows every good attorney and the judges. He knows everyone in our county and I know that no one will believe me. We live in a good ole boys town. He's from a very popular and loved family from where we live and I know how much I will be absolutely destroyed if I speak out against him. If I called the police on him, they wouldn't believe me. There are maybe two officers I know that would support me but they aren't in this jurisdiction. Part of me wants to believe him when he says he won't ever do it again but like I said, I know the statistics. I KNOW what happens to future me. I feel like a fool.

I don't really know why I'm posting this. I just needed to say it. I guess I just don't know what my first step would be with my circumstances. I know I'm an idiot for not leaving sooner so please don't think less of me for it. I just want the best for my children. And I know my children can't be raised in this kind of environment. They deserve better and I hate myself for waiting this long already. I just don't know where to go from here.

Thank you to everyone who read this far. I'm sorry it's a jumbled mess. If I missed anything, I'm sorry. I'll answer any questions if needed. Thank you in advance for any replies.",2023-05-15 05:59:43,2025-03-17 16:34:14,strangle

I was nonconsensually strangled by someone in the past on a date (not to the point where I passed out, but close to that and it was pretty terrifying) so it makes me uneasy, but if I say anything he'll always just roll his eyes and say I'm overreacting and/or he's just joking and not actually using any pressure.

I also have a chronic pain condition, so even light slapping/hitting can be painful sometimes. I often tell him ""ow"" and to be more gentle with me, and he sighs and says that I'm too sensitive, everything hurts me, and that I'm no fun. He always thinks I am overreacting or being dramatic when I say anything so I just let it go, even if it does hurt a little sometimes.

He has never *actually* hurt me or laid a finger on me in a physically violent way or when he's angry. He has rage/anger issues and will sometimes lose it and cuss me out, raise his voice, yell/shout, throw or kick things, punch the wall/table, or threaten to break up with me. Then he apologizes profusely afterward. He wants to get help to stop being unstable and lashing out at me. He also says that at least he's not physically abusive (and that a lot of men are a lot worse).

Since he's never actually harmed or physically abused me, I'm not sure if I should be concerned about any of the stuff he does jokingly, or if I am overreacting.",2024-12-13 00:48:45,2025-03-17 16:34:15,strangle

anyway this was over a full year now, last time he strangled me was november or december 2023

if you've been strangled, do you get ptsd symptoms from it/have you been diagnosed with ptsd? I am not looking for a diagnosis, I'm already diagnosed with cptsd but can anyone empathize with these symptoms:
- I just smoked, I don't smoke often so I notice the way it constricts my airway in a way I didn't pay as much attention to before. feeling any pressure on my windpipe freaks me out.
- I have nightmares of being strangled. doesn't help that I gave sleep apnea so whenever I have an episode now it'll be accompanied by a strangulation dreams. like i physically can't breathe and it translates in the dream as seeing him above me strangling me. fortunately new daily inhaler has helped me breathe better in my sleep so this hasn't happened lately
- I guess sort of flashbacks? like I'll be driving and still aware of the road but reliving it in my minds eye
- I can't watch it in movies. even cartoons if a character gets choked out I start to feel it
- tried to hook up with someone and they put their hand near my neck and I immediately hit it away from me

anyway i'm doing pretty much fine now, overall happy with life. just small moments aren't good. ",2025-01-25 03:16:41,2025-03-17 16:34:16,strangle

We‚Äôve met at a time when he was married, but soon after grown feelings and formed a relationship. He has stated he never wanted to be married and wanted to leave. During this course of 5 years, I‚Äôve been through a situation when many days felt like too good to be true. Felt like I was being watched by people. I also felt like every time I was having a good day, he would suddenly use that against me and send me sms‚Äôs trying to diminish me that I done something for myself. He would then ghost me or try to guilt trip me. It then became a continuous cycle of this for 5 years. 

During our early sex, he also went out of my room and grabbed a knife out of the kitchen. He came back and I felt absolutely mortified but calm. He went on me and put it on me. He wanted to stab me but didn‚Äôt and his persona changed as if his mind got taken over by another part of him stating that he would‚Äôve put a knife through me that night. 

It went by to another incident where he‚Äôs continuously keeping an eye on me. And I‚Äôm having struggles trying to get out of his mind or world. He had emotionally tried to kill me and physically killed me recently this year.

I found out during the course of our 7 years (now) he has also divorced, he had also continued another affair during the last 5 years and I‚Äôm in this position of feeling stunned. 

During this course of spending 5 years almost everyday with this man, and supporting him in his growth despite his violent tendencies I wished I woke up sooner. I now face a crazy woman that he also slept with during that same course knowing personal things about our relationship which is creepy and also obscene. I phoned his ex wife and asked him if he was ever violent towards her and she also didn‚Äôt answer. I confronted him and asked why he cheated when it was a serious relationship and he ended up strangling me in his bed till I passed out and screaming stop stop stop.

I asked why did you do that. He laughed and said I thought you might‚Äôve wanted that. 

I left his home speechless and concerned. I face my days being emotionally played by his feelings and need to find ground. 

He smsed me saying I‚Äôm a sociopath and I‚Äôm selfish. I had enough of his psychopath violent an also him continuously blaming me. 

The woman he also ended up cheating on the same time we are together for 5 years has also been harassing me on the phone. She also has been harassing him and sending him blackmail and threats of going to his home which is separate from his family. I am dealing with 2 psychopaths and I am questioning on how on earth did two potentially killers are not being watched by state police for the amount of homicide and also organized crimes are involved. The woman is also known to have bashed and hurt many men as well. 

I can‚Äôt go to the cops because his ex wife is part of a bikie gang. I am certain they had eliminated people in the past. I never knew this at the time and had received threats. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I want these two psychological abusers out of my life for good. I don‚Äôt know who is trained enough to eliminate such attacks to a point I had died this year 4-5 times due to his mental attacks and me convulsing due to being strangled this year.

I did not go to the police. I told him if he let me go home to my mother & father that I wouldn't call.

I do have a video and text message proof that this happened.

I know I should definitely report this, but carrying the weight of being the reason why someone goes to prison is unnerving to me. On the other hand, I feel like I'll be angry down the line in time because I didn't do anything about it and let him get away with doing such a thing to me. 

Part of me feels like I'm over reacting because he only strangled me for less than 10 seconds. Is it worth it to ruin someone's life for less than 10 seconds?

sorry for weird formatting issues i'm on mobile

to sum up our relationship, i (19ftm, closeted) started dating my boyfriend (18m) in 2020, i was in a very bad home situation so i moved in with him and his mother around june of 2020 when we were both 15, she's been very welcoming and has no idea what's going on (or what little she does know, has excused)

the physical and mental abuse started in early 2021, and just keeps getting worse. 

for reference i have autism and boyfriend often takes advantage of it by forcing me into a meltdown where i cant control my actions and hit him so he has an excuse to beat the fuck out of me. but he never leaves marks, he knows better.

2 weeks ago, october 20th, after inducing a meltdown on me he used his hand to cover up my nose and mouth, almost entirely cutting off my breathing. then he threw me on the floor, sat on my chest and did it again. he did it several more times giving me about 15 seconds in between (for him to catch his breath)
during this i whimpered to him that he was going to kill me, so he screamed GOODBYE in my face when he went to smother me again.

then he got off of me and said he was going to find duct tape to tie up my hands so i couldn't fight back.
and in that moment i was positive i was going to die, that was it for me.

then his mom came home from work. 30 minutes earlier than she is supposed to. and it was over and i'm alive. she doesn't know what he did and she never will.

i was a victim to a home invasion when i was 13 years old and home alone. the fear i felt then is NOTHING like what i felt 2 weeks ago.

and there's nothing i can do about it. i can't leave. i've more or less accepted that i'm going to die by his hand because now i really know what he's capable of. i have no friends here because i've been so isolated (i'm not allowed to leave the house by myself, only to stores with him&his mom or short walks around the neighborhood). and after everything i've been through with the legal system in my state from the home invasion, i'd rather die than get police involved AGAIN.

sorry this is so random i just wanted to get it all out, thanks whoever is reading for just giving me the time of day to hear my story.",2023-11-08 06:11:30,2025-03-17 16:35:32,strangle

Instead of taking it out on me (although it obviously indirectly still haunts me) he grabbed an innocent kitten, screaming and cussing at it. It peed all over him and then he hit it over and over and threw it because he got even more angry it peed on his sweatshirt. To this day I am haunted by that scene, I feel sick, and I feel terrible that I did nothing. I was afraid and I left but I did nothing. I struggle with this so much.

it's been 2 days. It still hurts to swallow.
My heartbis broken...How could the Man I loved do this?
I didnt return his attempts of kindness back the way he wantes me to.
I wasnt a bitch it's just that it became hard to see his kindness as something sincere...If i didnt come at him with the feelings of gratitude he wanted he began name calling.
I didn't fight back with mean words. I tried to tell him why I felt the way I did. 
Then he started throwing things at me. while i sat in our bed trying to write my words down because he just wouldn't listen to my feelings and concerns. 
I tried to leave. That's when he 1st hit me.  
I had told him from the beginning of our relationship if he ever laid a hand on me I would be gone forever....so I reminded him of that and said I would now be leaving forever and this was not just going to be time apart for him to calm down. I tried to leave...he blocked the way so I pushed to try to get through the door way. He took that as it was now ok to beat my ass.
For an hour he would beat me then stop and try to convince me that He wasn't being this way to be cruel. I had turned him intinthis monster.
He wrapped his hands around my throat and pinned my body against the ground...this time it was only for a moment....he continued to punch and kick me while i cried...i screamed as he grabbed my hair and slammed me against the floor.
I tried to call me friend but he made me hang up.
I begged for him to let me go...all this was happening while my daughter was sleeping in the room next door..
He held me down a second time....I tried to fight back...his hands got tighter...I couldn't scream...I couldn't breathe....i could only stare into his hateful eyes and pray he would let me go so I could save me daughter....that's all in wanted was to get the fuck out of that house with her.....my ears started to ring....my vision began to fade.....he let go but I don't remember..i just remember springing back up in defense....and telling myself to tell him what ever he needed to hear so i could get a moment to leave and call the police.
I finally got out and called the police....I reaked of beer from where he had spit it on me and spilled it over me as I was crying....I told them what had happened and that they could get me to take a test...the dispatcher haf told me to get in my car anf wait for them....they Took pictures of my neck and head...pictures of the bruises.....I showed them the voice recordings of how he was talking to me right before it happened....they arrested him...
His friends called me asking if i could drop the charges. Asking if I thought it was right to ruin his life over this.....they didnt understand...I was mad and sad and shocked and confused.....I couldnt even drop the charges if i wanted to.....the cops are the ones that prosecuted him...I could not show up to court.....but the judge would still look at the evidence....
now i'm hear two and a half days later....trying to put my life back together and make sense of it all....trying to understand why it happened....missing the man I feel in love with.....but also reading about euphoric recall and researching things about domestic abuse...",2021-01-10 13:37:51,2025-03-17 16:35:38,strangle

But I have the list of concerning symptoms to watch for following a strangulation and none of them apply. I can't waste time going and waiting just for them to say they see no bruise so it must be okay.

I decided to take out my phone to record and he snatches it out of my hand and takes off running. I call 911 to report my phone stolen and the police showed up and I just broke down and told them everything I have been going through with this person. 

  
Today 2/12 . He was arrested. I should be happy. I should be able to take a breath of fresh air so why do I feel like I am drowning. I threw up my breakfast once they told me they have him. I want to say somethings about this man (not to make you have sympathy) but it's good to mention. He has severe mental health issues. I don't think he understands to the full extent what's about to happen to him or what he has done. This is why I feel extremely guilty. I feel like I have handed him over to a system that I know is not built to protect him or help him. He is a black man with mental health issues , I know inside the system he is not going to get the support he needs and that makes me sick to my stomach. I have begged and pleaded for him to seek professional help and take medication if needed but he never does or lies about going to therapy to try and get me back. He also doesn't have any family to support him either , he does not get along with his family. His family is basically where he works. He got arrested in-front of his peers and bosses. I feel like I have ruined his life.

 How do I stop feeling this way? Has anyone reported their abuser and felt this way before? I could really use advice. I am terrified I will repeat the cycle of dropping the charges when the district attorney calls me.",2025-02-12 15:52:30,2025-03-17 16:35:52,strangle

Before our relationship ever turned physically violent he has some manipulative tendencies and would say verbally abusive things and play mind games.

1h51eub,"Was this system exploitative? My ex had a cuck kink and I tried it out. I admit I enjoyed being eaten out or talking to men for validation, but I wasn‚Äôt really into casual intercourse. I was shy on calls. My friends say this was still creepy and predatory of him, are they overreacting??? I‚Äôm sorry. ",mysteryfairylove,12,37,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h51eub,"His biggest defenses or excuses are it was consensual and we both wanted to try it even if he first introduced it and implemented it. I did get raped intercourse wise once due to the kink. I was eaten out without my consent another time. And there was a time I felt pressure to have sex with someone I told ahead that I only wanted to be eaten out from‚Ä¶ I got an STI that was so painful, we thought I had appendicitis and went to the emergency room. 

The hospital initially thought it was just a bad bladder infection, but after being recommended to a specialist - they feared I had ovarian cancer due to messed up blood results? I then asked for an STI panel and they told me I had contracted chlamydia. I had my blood drawn a lot to get the medicine required to cure both of us, my ex experienced 0 symptoms of it. But they said I still might have cancerous blood. I spent a month worried I might have cancer due to the delayed appointment. Luckily I didn‚Äôt and I was cured of the STI. But it was pretty traumatic. 

He argues that he ‚Äúbegged us to stop‚Äù the cuck stuff after I was harmed, but I ‚Äúbegged us‚Äù to keep trying due to wanting to relive my trauma in a healthier seeming way with men who listened to my boundaries? As a coping mechanism. My friends think if he truly wanted to stop, he would have though. He was still cumming and sexually benefiting or gaining gratification more from it? He wasn‚Äôt in the room when I was raped, but he waited outside in his car and didn‚Äôt know better I suppose. Although he admits he heard me screaming. He thought it was just kinky which it was, until it wasn‚Äôt. The penetrative rape was so fast. 

I guess part of why I talked to people behind his back after is I started to feel unsafe and unprotected. I wonder if it‚Äôs my fault since I told him he doesn‚Äôt have to beat the guy up, but I wanted him to deep down because how else was I going to feel safe? He says he regrets it deeply that he never did. He encouraged me to meet the guy (among other old abusers) later on, even though he never fully let it happen. I develop traumatic kinks and fetishize my own trauma as a way to survive so I remember being numb the following day and saying he should let me see the guy who hurt me again. He found it hot, but promised me he would never let me see him again. I guess the point is he knew I‚Äôm susceptible to Stockholm syndrome and trauma bonding?

I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes in this relationship too. Breaking down and screaming like I‚Äôm insane. Self harming or feeling suicidal. Repeatedly lying about talking to my ex or others (although that was confusing or blurry for me considering the guy I was with had a cuck kink and had full access to my phone‚Ä¶.). I also saved 700 points I have not gotten to spend. He offered to pay me $400 to make up for it since he broke up with me, but I said that‚Äôs like paying me off even though the point was for sentimental redemption with dates + quality time?? He said he will never offer it again then.

I think it is important to mention he did take me out on some very nice dates and gave me a lot of gifts or fed me any way ‚Äúfor free‚Äù or without spending points. I am grateful for all of that. And I am sorry for any time I ‚Äúthreatened to kill myself‚Äù from the trauma or ‚Äúemotionally manipulated‚Äù / controlled him to stay ?? Although I always told him to only be with me if he really wants to be with me too‚Ä¶.I think I felt like I couldn‚Äôt survive without him after everything I went through for him. I wanted it to amount to being soulmates?

I still self blame for him leaving often or hate myself for supposedly emotionally ‚Äúcheating‚Äù on him. Although I was never having intercourse with or dating any one behind his back really. And I struggle with wondering if we are both abusers even if if he‚Äôs done worse. Such as strangling me until I passed out for a few seconds?, hitting, bruising, ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù gaslighting, ‚Äúunintentional‚Äù rape. I think I am also to  blame because I would feel suicidal and tell him he should kill me or beat me so I get what I deserve. My friends think he took advantage of my mental illness? He said he was scared someone else would do it if he didn‚Äôt. I even said that a few times due to trying to turn on his kink. Idk if I made him hit me or hurt me ? I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs justified he‚Äôs discarded me and ghosted after promising we are friends? I wonder if this system really is as predatory as people have been telling me it might be.

I was very close to my boyfriend we were practically joined at the hip. He always been very kind and gentle and last night all hell broke lose-all over a beer. This is stupid but I've been sharing my beer with him and this time I hid one for myself. He came over and had the nerve to go through my fridge in my home chug my beer and plopped my last empty can in front of me calling me a selfish bitch. I was doing a hard workout and haven't seen him do this. I told him he could have asked first. We always shared our stuff but this felt like crossing major boundaries. He then shoved his sandwich in my face, hand over my mouth smearing and shoving this sandwich all over my face and chest. I was in so much shock it took me a few seconds to register that he was actually rubbing a garlic cheese sandwich in my face. He then tried to smother me. When I finally managed to break free I screamed that he had no right to do all that to me he said I DESERVED it all and to shut up. I begged and cried for him to leave. He then tried to strangle me and shoved more food in my face calling me a fat worthless greedy drunken bitch. I only had 2. I never felt so degraded. I used to have an eating disorder and had just went up 3 inches on my waist and upper thighs sizes so having food shoved and smeared in my face........after him preaching pretty at every size, body positivity, it's okay to be big, stop being so paranoid about your size etc, I'm shocked and devastated. 

regardless he grabbed me super roughly and smeared food all over me. I was gagging and fighting for air. 

All over one can of beer. Stupid. I never want to see him again. I used to be emotionally abused before by my narcissist ex and bullied a lot growing up. I cried all night. Yes I'm looking into recovery. I'm scared of him now. I've been going through a lot with my mental health lately so this was another very difficult situation on top of it. I'm just really shocked as he never abused me once before. He's the type of person to never apologize so I told him to never come by me again. He kept saying it was my fault.

If I flinch, look frightened for a moment, or ask him why he's doing it, he will tell me that I'm too sensitive, paranoid, am no fun, and complain about how he can't even joke/play around with me without me massively overreacting.

He says that playfulness is part of his personality/sense of humor, and that if I have a problem with it then maybe I just don't like him. I have stopped asking him to stop slapping/biting/fake strangling me and don't say anything when he jokes about killing me anymore because I know he'll just tell me I'm being too sensitive.

The thing is, since January, we have been arguing. And every time, it gets worse. I never saw him mad like this before so I couldn‚Äôt have suspected it. 
The first time it happened, he said to me that one day he‚Äôd kill him and I would have to live with the guilt of it. 
The second time he banged his head against a wall out of anger. 
The third time he tried to cut his wrists but I stopped him and I don‚Äôt think he wanted to hurt himself badly.

When I was 6 months pregnant, he strangled me during an argument and I‚Äôve been terrified since then.
Also while pregnant, I couldn‚Äôt handle the stress. Every time he would get angry I would just leave and try not to stress out otherwise I would have really bad contractions. I often asked him not to yell but he wouldn‚Äôt calm down until I got mad myself. 

The day I came home from the maternity, he slapped me for the first time. I was on the couch with the baby and he was in front of me, yelling. I asked repeatedly ‚ÄúPlease, stop. Don‚Äôt talk loudly in front of the baby‚Äù. Wouldn‚Äôt stop. He approached me, still yelling, so I put my feet in front of him to keep him at a distance. I saw that he tried to strangle me,but I moved, so he slapped me in the face. Later he said it was because I was ‚Äúacting crazy in front of the baby‚Äù, so he was afraid I‚Äôd hurt him. 


Tonight, I put baby in the carrier and go for a walk with him. We argued for something silly but I don‚Äôt want any screaming or anything bc of baby and also, I‚Äôm really tired of arguing with him as it leads nowhere. I tell him to go home, I‚Äôll walk by myself.

Outside it‚Äôs cold, and inside the apartment SO hot. When I come home I remove the carrier and crash on the couch. I was feeling so bad that I couldn‚Äôt see.  
Bf takes the baby, who starts crying as I go outside in the cold to feel better.  Seconds later I hear him yell my name, so I get in. I take the baby and say he‚Äôs stupid, I almost passed out so he could at least keep the baby for 5 minutes. 
He yells as loud as he can ‚ÄúJust take the baby ! Stop being a stupid girl ! Just do your fucking job !‚Äù 
He was just next to us. 
I‚Äôm afraid the baby will be impacted by all of the yelling. 
I‚Äôm afraid it will only get worse. I‚Äôm scared for myself. 


He will always come back and apologize and say how he loves me and stuff. 
Everything outside of that is pure gold. We laugh, we can talk about anything, we‚Äôre a good team with the baby. 

My family loves him. My friends love him and so do I. 
We have plans. We have an apartment together. 
I don‚Äôt have any money atm, he works but I stopped at the end of my pregnancy. 
I just feel stuck. I need help. 
I want to make it better, but is it even possible ?
I want my son to have a dad who‚Äôs present. 

Please help.",2023-11-09 19:19:22,2025-03-17 16:36:16,strangle

I didn‚Äôt answer any of the calls. I‚Äôm an emotional wreck knowing he‚Äôs looking at years in prison. I know it‚Äôs deserved but it‚Äôs like loosing my best friend even tho he‚Äôs abusive. 



So my abusive boyfriend, I love him so much and I know he‚Äôs been through a lot but anytime we argue or we have a disagreement he loses self control. Whether it‚Äôs from throwing things and breaking my windshield or taking things and being very sporadic like running away sleeping outside to guilt trip me or, literally jumping out of a moving car. But things escalated in 2023 when he strangled me twice during a argument because I was mad and also started loading BB gun bullets never shot me but my things weren‚Äôt safe. Long story short a year went by with just emotional abuse It‚Äôs hard for me to trust him because he *was* a PA (he claimed he stopped haven‚Äôt found anything so idk)  and I anytime I ask him QUESTIONS he gets very angry or if I‚Äôm feeling insecure.  I had a cheating dream and was sad and just kinda lost it I told him I knew he was cheating or something sneaky going on and I wanted to get my things and leave. He got really angry tried to run away from me to keep ky Xbox n things but I went Into the house and started grabbing my items and he kept tackling me with neck grabs where I couldn‚Äôt breathe. Not once but 3 times til the point I called 911 and had to go get medicine for my neck. I feel really bad bc he‚Äôs talking about how he could go to jail for a long time and he wants me to tell the courts to dismiss this case (I already dismissed one) and idk deep down I don‚Äôt want him to go to jail but I also don‚Äôt want to die. And when he‚Äôs angry idk‚Ä¶ I called the police everytime out of sheer fear not trying to get him in trouble but he did say he‚Äôll fix my windshield but when he‚Äôs mad he‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not doing that. So idk I‚Äôm conflicted his family said I‚Äôm after him but that‚Äôs not true I‚Äôm just scared so I call the police n give my statement. But afterwards of course it‚Äôs nothing but love and good times to the point of im familiar with him and im not really interested in anyone else. But I don‚Äôt want to end up like gabby petito. 


Help with advice for my mental health because I‚Äôm so confused and torn there‚Äôs nothing I can do about the statement I made. But I feel so so bad about it but another part of me doesn‚Äôt. He was part of my everything wake up talk to him n we‚Äôre together til the end of the day so it feels like withdrawals? Idk. 








TLDR/ abusive ex apologized for choking me bt it‚Äôs his 3rd incident but I feel bad for calling the cops. ",2025-02-16 16:48:29,2025-03-17 16:36:17,strangle
192kxnc,I Feel Like Almost Everyone Failed Me,thee_runningrebel,121,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/192kxnc/i_feel_like_almost_everyone_failed_me/,"I posted here the other day about trying to go ghost after he strangled me on New Year's Eve. I ended up communicating with him again because of all the threats so I figured that trying to make peace would keep me or anyone else I care about from getting hurt. Everything was calm until he strangled me again on Sunday. This time, I felt like I was going to die. I had to fight him off to stay conscious. Then, he held me hostage for at least an hour--could not leave his sight, shower, drink water, or have access to any of my belongings (including my phone, wallet, or keys). I finally was able to get away when he wasn't looking. I contacted the police and he now has felony warrants out and the EMTs took me to the hospital. I spent all day there l getting checked out and when I was discharged, I returned home to find him locked inside my apartment with the police unable to get him to come out. I needed a safe place to sleep for the night until I could contact management to get me a key the next morning.

Instead of taking me to a DV shelter (like I believed they were), the police took me to a substance use/mental health facility. I never felt so out of place and alone. Granted, these facilities are necessary for people who need them but the thing is... I DIDN'T. I was subjected to a naked ""skin assessment"", had to give up all my belongings, I was drug tested, had to do multiple substance use and suicide screenings, had to do multiple medical assessments and vitals despite being at the hospital all day, had to do a psychiatric evaluation, was told I should start medication when I've never needed to. I couldn't sleep in my own clothes. I wasn't given any opportunity to speak to a crisis counselor or advocate for DV. No speak of my legal options (besides the criminal warrants). I was treated like a person with a psychiatric and substance use issue when all I needed was a safe place to sleep for the night and space to process what happened to me. On top of all of that, I had to spend almost 2 hours on the bus to get home when I was discharged because there was nothing in place for transport. 

I'm so angry. In less than 24 hours, I had to re-tell what happened to me at least 7 times. The police seemed more concerned with issuing a warrant and arresting him than ensuring I had the proper resources. The staff at the facility (while kind) unintentionally traumatized me more. So now, I have to process this lack of agency I feel along with the most recent incident of abuse. I was only trying to do the best thing for myself and keep myself safe.

Rant over. I'm just so tired of how law enforcement and people in other community settings are ill informed about DV and what survivors need and just let us slip through the cracks. 

I know I can't be the only one.",2024-01-09 17:59:36,2025-03-17 16:36:18,strangle
1hf9gvs,Pregnant in an abusive relationship ,Original_Debt_6455,6,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hf9gvs/pregnant_in_an_abusive_relationship/,"Hi guys, I need some advice and support. 
I've been dating my boyfriend for over a year, first 6 months of dating I was working, had a job at a car dealership, I was making good money but all my coworkers were males. My boyfriend was feeling extremely jealous and we broke up a few times because of that. He called me a flirt only because I smile when meet customers some of whom happen to be males. 

After a few months of dating I found out that he had a baby with his ex-girlfriend and he wanted to take the baby from her and get full custody. Once she left the baby with him for 2 weeks and he didn't give the baby back, now they are fighting in court. 

So the point is, he convinced me to quit my job to move in with him and help him take care of the baby until he turns 12 months and can go to daycare. I agreed because I wanted to complete some educational courses and change my career. Of course when his baby turned 1 year old he didn't send him to daycare and I had to keep taking care of him on my own. There were times when he would go on a business trip for 2 weeks and I would stay alone with the baby. Every time I asked him about daycare, we would have an argument. Also he would call me lazy all the time and even useless. One time he didn't like my soup so he spit into my face, kicked me out of the apartment and told me that this happened to me because I don't know how to ""f### cook"". 

I didn't have any place to stay, so I stayed at the hotel for a night and then came back because I didnt have money to afford staying at the hotel for a few days looking for a room to rent. And I didnt have a car so taking uber to move my stuff was also too expensive. I came back. And in a few weeks we had an argument again. 

All those 6 months we were sleeping on the floor, without a mattress, just on blankets and he was blaming me for that, because I couldn't choose the one I liked (lie, I told him which one I wanted, but he didn't like it). His brother was supposed to come next week and my boyfriend started to look for furniture. He asked me if we needed a dining table and I asked if he wanted to buy it for us or because of his brother. That's when it started. He was yelling at me, calling me names, calling me stupid and when I started to cry, he said I was acting like a child and I'm stupid and annoying. Next day in the morning, he continued calling me names and stuff. I said I was done with it and that I was going to leave. He took a knife and cut my suitcase in peaces, kicked it and told me to collect my stuff in trash bags and leave immediately. While I was collecting my stuff and crying he was still yelling at me and he told me if I don't shut up and the neighbors would call the cops, he would kill me. 

I couldn't control myself anymore. I said that I hated him. He said I hate you more and started to strangle me,  I was trying to break free, i was begging him to stop. I was 100% sure he would kill me, then he brought me into the kitchen, took a knife and hit my head with a handle of a knife. Painful but not dangerous. I was scared, I was shocked, couldn't stop crying. He asked me what I was going to do and I said nothing. He calmed down then and left. Came back after a few minutes with a chocolate bar and was trying to have sex with me and I was afraid to say no. I was just crying. He stopped and left saying okay it's not the bast moment. 

Since then I started to look for a new place and also for a nanny for the baby. So I could leave without telling him. I arranged everything, but then found out I was pregnant. I told him, he was happy. Then I told him that I didn't want to stay at home with his baby because after 9 months I will have to do the same and it's too hard. He told me to start paying half the expenses the same moment. We had an argument and he stopped talking to me. I packed my stuff and left. 

And now I don't know what to do next. I don't have anyone in the country, no family , no friends, he isolated me from everyone I knew and could ask for help or advice. He also smashed the phone with all my contacts. I'm still very early in my pregnancy and I took a few HCG tests and they looked a bit concerning, so I'm not sure if the pregnancy is going to develop well. For now I'm looking for a job and waiting for my doctor's appointment. He suggested to have lunch together and I agreed, but he didn't make it on time (he didn't even leave his apartment when I was already there) so I left. He said he would come and pick me and my stuff up and I said no. He told me to ""go f## myself"". I can't stop crying. Any advice. Please ",2024-12-16 02:53:25,2025-03-17 16:36:20,strangle

""Boyfriend put a pillow over my face during an argument. (F18) (M19)""


So our relationship isn't the best, I mean he really does annoy me and I really do annoy him but sometimes I question if I should leave or not. I love him too much to actually leave.

Our argument started because he called me a b*tch because I upset him, so I turned over and told him to not touch or talk to me to which his response was to touch me with his feet. I moved away and he kept touching me, this repeated for about 10-20 minutes.

(This is for later, but he usually does this thing when he gets upset at me and he repeats 'You're mad.' Over and over to aggrivate me.)

After his constant pestering and me wanting to be alone he then goes on his phone to which I then start saying, 'You're mad.' 

This didn't go well.

He called me ugly and fat and single and that he wanted me to pack my bags and leave. (I live in his house 4 hours away from my parents.) I just kept saying it though because I was really pissed off.

He then grabbed a pillow and smashed it against my face for 30 seconds with it and I couldn't breath at all. I was so scared and wanted to cry, this is a new thing for him too, he's never done this before.
After that, the argument continued until he did it again but harder.
I know I made him angry but I'm not sure on what to do.

Also I've asked him many times to not call me a b*tch and in this argument he did it twice. He's called me fat and ugly before and he's strangled me (Not hard enough or long enough to cause damage.)

I've called him names before but usually after he does which isn't right or okay, and when he put the pillow on my face I grabbed him hard and kicked him.

This is as much as I can recollect from the moment. I just don't know what to do anymore.

tl;dr

Boyfriend puts pillow over my face in a heated argument and incouldnt breath and I don't know what to do.",2024-03-18 16:20:56,2025-03-17 16:36:21,strangle

Threw me out car in road (because I found out he had cheated) with my stuff 

Now he‚Äôs gone round everyone and recorded this big black eye

The police have already been shit to me. Last time they were called because he strangled me he managed to twist it around.

1ixz8co,"Pregnant with abusive partner, I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶",Time_Background9589,7,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ixz8co/pregnant_with_abusive_partner_i_dont_know_what_to/,"    I‚Äôve been in an extremely toxic, unhealthy relationship for the past two years. A bit of context, I met him while I was going through addiction to m*th and experiencing homelessness. I quit cold turkey when we met. In the first 6 months, it was fine. We lived with his roommate, then separated because his roommate‚Äôs wife didn‚Äôt want me living there. He wasn‚Äôt abusive then. I went to live with my mother who kicked me out, lived with her for a year until she kicked me out again, even though I was working. We reunited and I moved in with him while he was renting a room. This is when the horror for me started. We would get into arguments over silly things. It‚Äôs honestly kind of hard to remember what because I believed I blocked those memories out. This is when he started to be physically abusive. Despite living right next to other men, he would verbally and physically attack me. He strangled me several times within the first two months of us staying there. I literally peed myself and lost consciousness (which I didn‚Äôt even know until he brought up) 

    I‚Äôm ashamed to say that instead of getting help or helping myself like getting a job I stayed in this awful situation, unemployed and drinking to cope with the abuse occasionally. I felt stuck. He also was extremely verbally abusive. He‚Äôs said some evil, sick things to me. Told me he was going to murder me and throw me in a ditch, said he slept with other women, even my sister who he never met, told me I was worthless, retarded, a junkie, a m*thhead, told me sell my body for drugs, spitting in my face at grocery stories and home, etc‚Ä¶.the list goes on. He has been verbally abusive to me hundreds of times. My mental health has seriously declined since being with him. We had the cops come so many times, and I never filed a police report on him for fear of my own safety. 

While living in this apartment, the abuse has gotten worse. He has strangled me several times again, beat the living daylights out of me for relapsing despite me remaining sober for a long time, kicked my feet from under me, slapped me, backhanded me, shoved his fingers in my mouth and used his nails to scratch my gums til they‚Äôre bleeding and almost felt like my gums were shredded, slammed my leg in the door until it was black and blue for weeks, smashed my finger into his phone (I can‚Äôt even bend my index finger anymore), and slapped me so hard (recently) that I‚Äôm seeing white spots in my eyes. I‚Äôm worried it will get worse‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt tell you how badly this has worn me down. I genuinely feel like nothing but a worthless, stupid, junkie

    I had a job briefly after we moved into an apartment, but it didn‚Äôt last. Not due to our relationship, but my manager didn‚Äôt like me I assume. I did my job, and tried to socialize but I‚Äôve always been an outcast. After I quit, (they completely took me off the schedule for 3 weeks), I remained unemployed. My self esteem is so destroyed‚Ä¶Shortly after this, I relapsed on m*th. I was sober for nearly two years. I couldn‚Äôt handle the abuse anymore. He literally would tell me, in his fit of rage and evilness, to overdose, go smoke m*th, and I did. 

I‚Äôm ashamed to say it but he has put me through so much trauma and abuse, I needed an outlet. I continued to use for 7 months, not day in and day out, but I became addicted again. Until I found out I was pregnant. I stopped using when I started having symptoms like nausea. Please don‚Äôt judge me too hard‚Ä¶.I tried to leave him so many times before it got to this point. But he would apologize and say he would change.  I would be adamant that I don‚Äôt want to be with him, but he wouldn‚Äôt accept that. And I stayed because I have nobody. No friends or no family who would help me out. We have been having unprotected s*x for two years and I honestly thought I was infertile. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to have s*x anymore because of how he treated me but he still would not listen and go ahead anyways. 

Now here I am, pregnant and he has hurt me still. He slammed my door in the leg as I mentioned previously for trying to get my personal items that he takes off with. He has smashed my head in the wall (not very hard but still), and I did hit him once when he called me retarded out of rage. I was just so angry, but I shouldn‚Äôt have done that because now I have a potential eye injury. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm having suicidal thoughts. I don‚Äôt have any family. He supports me, but I can‚Äôt take this no more. I‚Äôm probably 3-4 months pregnant, and am faced with having an abortion but don‚Äôt have any money. I love my baby, but I don‚Äôt know how I will be able to take care of it. I‚Äôm not even taking care of myself. Any advice or any words of encouragement would help me tremendously. I have nobody and I‚Äôm suffering all by myself‚Ä¶Thanks to anyone who is listening.",2025-02-25 16:36:04,2025-03-17 16:36:23,strangle
1gyfsdx,Ex bf upset I didn't message him,Vengeful-Sorrow247,21,20,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gyfsdx,"I didn't know how to title it. This was January 2023.

So I was staying with my ex bf after he was discharged from a mental health hospital end of 2022. When I was looking after him, my mother fell into a coma on New year's eve and was in the for nearly a month. I visited her nearly every day. When my mother did wake up from her coma and was stable, she was moved to a different ward where there was no signal. She needed help walking and bathing herself and didn't like the nurses. I was also my mother's carer.

He would constantly message me while I was with her, if I didn't reply quick enough he would threaten to kill himself and I would have to talk him down from it, call an ambulance. 

On Jan 17, he beat me. He was mad that it took me so long to cook and eat _(I had a long important phone call, he knew this)._ He didn't want to look at me, said that I wanted him to starve so I went to the living room and the door accidentally slammed shut. My hands was full with my food. By the time I put it down, he rushed into the room, screaming ""how dare I slam doors in his house"". He punched and kicked my head and back while I begged him to stop. Kicked my food everywhere, broke glass, punched his walls. I was only wearing a dressing gown and he pulled it off me, tried to strangle me with it and left me naked on the floor while he went around destroying his flat. His windows were wide open. I was terrified. Banging his head against the walls yelling that he's going to kill himself. When neighbours tried to knock he told them to fuck off then went to hit me again. Saying that this is my fault, look what I made him do and how I want to get him arrested like all his other exes. Multiple neighbours and passersby called the police.

 When they came, we told them he was having a mental health crisis and that he didn't hurt me. I couldn't go see my mother that day, it was too late. He went to the hospital and I stayed, cleaning up his mess. He was in the hospital overnight and most of the day. I stayed up until 12pm, I was just in shock about it all. My body was aching. My head hurt. Emotionally I was numb. I had a short nap and then rushed to see my mother in the new ward. I wasn't focusing on him. It was the best I felt in so long. Me and my mother were chatting, I helped her walk around her room, eat and bathed her. I just didn't want to leave her when it was time. He tried calling and texting me but there was no signal. 

While he was texting me, I was snappy with him. I was still upset about the day before. I didn't do what I normally do when I forget to text which is me sending a big paragraph explaining everything I did from the moment I woke up in detail, how I forgot to message because I was busy, apologising, telling him I love him and using pet names etc.

I called an ambulance and couldn't answer him because I was on the phone to them. He always gets upset with me when I call them. I gave the opperator his number and I waited on his road for an hour or so until they arrived because I was terrified of what he would do to me alone because I gave him attitude. I just couldn't stop crying. I didn't want to go in because I never know what side of him I'll see. Especially since he drank and probably was in another destructive, violent mood 

Anytime I feel like I miss him, I'm going to write about about the things he did to me. I need to remind myself what sort of person he is.",2024-11-24 01:45:49,2025-03-17 16:36:25,strangle
1ii4uc0,I feel crazy and lost (advice please),AmIManipulated,4,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ii4uc0/i_feel_crazy_and_lost_advice_please/,"I (21F) live with my fianc√© (22M). We have been together for a little under 2 1/2 years. We‚Äôve had a really rocky relationship from the start. At the beginning of the relationship, I went to watch a movie with him at his apartment and found out that he was roommates with (and didn‚Äôt like) someone that I had previously been with a couple months prior and I did not tell him this information. Until about a year ago he would find every reason to degrade me and not trust me an ounce. He went through my phone almost everyday, told me what I could/couldn‚Äôt wear, made me dump friends, and wouldn‚Äôt allow me to pick new ones. All while convincing me that I was to blame. Please note that he got kicked out of his apartment about 2 months into our relationship and had no where to go so my parents allowed him to live in their home with me so all of this was happening in their home. I got fed up and almost left him and he told me he would fix it. Honestly, shockingly enough he did. Everything was great. My parents eventually did not want him living there anymore though and he moved to his sister‚Äôs apartment. This is where things get bad again. He tells me that he doesn‚Äôt trust me enough to have a ‚Äúlong distance relationship‚Äù (we would‚Äôve been 1 hour apart) and that I can move with him or we can break up. So, being naive i move with him. He left out that his sister lived in a 2 bedroom apartment with 2 kids and roaches. I was sleeping on his sister‚Äôs couch with him for months horrified of these bugs. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong I used to go camping and I am not prissy but there was an ungodly amount of these things. All throughout this, I am working and trying to provide for us, let him have some things he wants, and save. He starts looking through my phone again, spam calling me at work because I had male coworkers, and yelling at me in front of his sister and her kids and making me seem awful. I got tired again, tried to leave but I no longer had a support system and was scared to be alone. He fixes everything again and goes on to act like an incredible boyfriend. He gets a job and starts contributing to finances, I switch jobs and he supports me while I job search, he‚Äôs doing everything perfectly. We save up enough to finally get our own place but at this point I‚Äôm skeptical and bring up my concerns with him about his previous behavior and how this is a big commitment for me to sign that I will live with him for a year. We both came to an agreement that if something goes wrong (other than cheating) whoever moves out will be whoever was in the wrong and they will help pay rent until a roommate is found. Recently though, he‚Äôs started putting his hands on me. He‚Äôs been physically restraining me from moving and blocking doorways for about a year now. But he has started kicking me and slapping me. I have tried multiple things to help him calm down before we get to the point of this as I can now see when it is about to happen but nothing helps. It got to a peak 2 days ago when we were arguing (I don‚Äôt even remember what about honestly) and he knocked my phone out of my hand. I got upset and kept asking him to please sit down and asking him to take a second to himself if he needs time. He is in my face yelling at me and eventually lightly punch my rib. I screamed because I am honestly very scared of him at this point and didn‚Äôt know what else to do. He proceeded to lunge forward and hold me down and my first response was that I was scared and I needed to fight back and get out so I did what I thought would do the most damage and I grabbed him parts and squeezed. Unfortunately, he is a black belt and a trained martial artist so this honestly did nothing but anger him more. He grabbed my face and my neck, covered my mouth, and choked me to the point that I almost passed out and could see lights around me when I finally opened my eyes. This also left a bruise on my face from how hard he was pressing against it. He proceeded to walk away. I start crying and go to the room to get appropriately dressed and he starts crying and begging and saying he‚Äôs sorry and that he‚Äôs knows it was wrong. Now, mind you I have seen this man cry 2-3 times. Once when his brother moved away and again when his dad was going through a really, really hard time. I am exhausted and confused and accept his apology because I feel like I‚Äôm in denial. He promised that he will never do it again. I‚Äôve been giving his the stiff arm for days as my head honestly feels cloudy. Like I‚Äôve been doing things with him‚Ä¶ watching movies, gaming, etc. but we haven‚Äôt really talked much. He has been doing everything for me and constantly apologizing. Tonight I was gaming and I went to my friends list to invite him to a gaming party and he saw a name on there that I guess he thought was new.  He asked who it was and I responded telling him that it was a girl from social media that had said she wanted more women to game with but that we had different game modes we enjoyed so we hadn‚Äôt played together yet. He goes on to ask her race, age, name, to see the video of her saying that she wanted girl gamers, how many messages we had, if he could see the messages, etc. I, very annoyed answer these questions but eventually draw the line when he asks to see the messages as I feel that he has already gone way too far for the situation with the questions he asked alone. All of this is happening while I am already in a game. This upsets him and he walks over and turns my console off. Now, this game is a multiplayer fps and they take bans and reports VERY seriously. Players know this and if you leave a match they will absolutely report you. He also knows this very well as it is a game he plays and we report people for abandoning matches every time. So I turn my console on and continue to slightly play while also attempting to pay enough attention to him. He takes my controller, which he accidentally unmuted. All of this while yelling at me and degrading me. I take my controller back, my team just heard everything he said which first off is humiliating but I let them know that I have to leave and ask them not to report me. Before I can do anything else he takes my controller AGAIN, and leaves the game and turns my console off again. Now all of that feels extremely controlling to me but to top it off he continued to take my phone and just hold them. I ask him to just give them back and I‚Äôll put them beside me and he doesn‚Äôt so I attempt to take my things back as I don‚Äôt like the control imbalance that it displays. Apparently, I scraped his hand in my attempt and he lunged at me and held me down again while shaking and yelling in my face. My arm is bruised from how hard he squeezed it and I don‚Äôt know how to feel. He again immediately apologized for doing everything and promised it wouldn‚Äôt happen again. He said that it set him off and he thought that I had intentionally scratched him. He apologized for doing it either way because it was acceptable in any circumstance and also apologized for taking my phone, controller, and turning off my console. I am currently in the car typing all of this as I told him that I am deciding if I can continue this relationship. I know that it‚Äôs wrong but I honestly do love him and I do care about him so much. I want to be with him but I feel so scared when he‚Äôs angry and so nervous even when he‚Äôs not. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do, I don‚Äôt have any friends to call for advice or help and I have no idea if it will get worse or better. I feel like this instance isn‚Äôt big enough to leave over the more I think about it. Please give me any advice you have or words of wisdom. I am again only 21 with a foggy mind right now and this is my first big relationship so please be kind even if you think the solution is obvious. ",2025-02-05 07:35:41,2025-03-17 16:36:26,strangle
1iq4qat,I'm not happy but I'm scared of leaving,Adventurous_Act_6080,2,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iq4qat/im_not_happy_but_im_scared_of_leaving/,"Hello,

I have been in a relationship for five years with a man, but we have known each other for longer. It wasn‚Äôt the healthiest relationship at the beginning (cheating and lies on his part). But I always let it slide due to my emotional dependency. Today, I am sure he is no longer cheating on me.

However, he has a serious problem with alcohol, and he often becomes violent‚Äîmostly verbally, but once physically. He often threatens to hit me (but doesn‚Äôt do it), punches walls, and screams. One time, he tried to strangle me to scare me because I ""wouldn‚Äôt shut up""... But when he doesn‚Äôt drink, he‚Äôs not like that.

The problem is that now that I‚Äôve opened my eyes to my emotional dependency, I can no longer ignore it. On top of that, I‚Äôm struggling financially and can‚Äôt find a job. I can‚Äôt leave him because I‚Äôm afraid of ending up on the street. Also, my family loves him. But most of all, I still love him, and I don‚Äôt know what to do...

We have plans to get married and have children. But I‚Äôm afraid I will never know what happiness is. I have never felt truly happy... I don‚Äôt think happiness is meant for me.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel lost. Do you have any advice? I have no one to talk to...

1j4bqzv,Emotionally Abusive and Custody,ChewsFoodOnlyTwice,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j4bqzv/emotionally_abusive_and_custody/,"Hey guys

So my husband has been emotionally abusive for years. We went to therapy and it seemed to fix it but then it came back full force after I had our baby. Now I am finally at a place where I want to leave. It has gotten so bad. But I know that I won't get full custody. We will split custody 50/50 of our small infant. Has anyone split custody with someone that was emotionally abusive to you and how did you handle it? He is using the baby as leverage to stay married. He knows I don't want to split custody and he is using that to basically keep me in the marriage. 

Back story of the abuse. It was emotional, psychological and verbal. I have record of a lot of the verbal and journal entries of the psychological. He doesn't work. He is a stay at home dad and I take care of all the expenses. He has been blowing our savings. I have tried confronting him about this gently and he would deflect, shut down, not talk about it. So I redirected our money into a bank account that's only in my name and took him off my credit cards as an authorized user. He still found ways to pressure me into buying him stuff. Wearing me down until I just didn't care anymore. 

I then asked him to get a job so that he could financially contribute and he wouldn't. Still refuses to even talk to me about it. 

A couple months postpartum he flew into a rage because I said I didn't want the baby to go to the park and he left me working from home without childcare for the day. It was hard. When he got back he went into the basement and didn't come back up. He asked me to leave something on the stairs for him and I called him out on his childish behavior. Then he flew into a rage at me in our bedroom where our newborn was sleeping. I told him to keep it down but he got louder. I was really scared hovering over our sleeping infant crying. I told him to get out of the doorway because he was blocking me in. He got even more mad saying that he wasn't threatening me and I was over reacting. Then he got closer. I was turned away from him and he put his hand on my arm to get my attention and I blurted out ""If you put your hands on me I'm calling the police"" he then got very angry and called his mom and told her that I falsely accused him of abuse and threatened to put him in jail because he wanted to take our kid to the park. He then went on a month long crusade telling everyone and anyone who would listen that I was falsely accusing him of abuse and that I was manipulative and controlling. Once during a couples counseling session while I was recounting the events he shouted at me that I was full of shit and a liar and that I was making it all up. I decided to take some space from him and moved out if our shared bedroom. 

The 3 months after that have been the biggest mind fuck I could possibly imagine. He started recording our conversations for ""therapy"" but would put on a pretend nice voice. If he ever lost his cool he wouldn't record that then if I lost my cool (saying things like I don't want to be married to you anymore, this was a mistake, I hate you, get a job, etc.) then he would record that and send it to people to prove that I'm actually the abuser and the manipulative and controlling one. Now he has convinced everyone I know that I'm an abusive person. Has contacted abuse resources. Still insists that I falsely accused him of abuse. Refuses to have conversations about our marriage until I admit and take responsibility for my abusive behavior. On recording of course. It's been so persistent that until I just typed out the situation that happened 4 months ago I had forgotten about it entirely and I'm constantly on the edge of believing him. That I am the problem and if I could just approch topics with calmness instead of demanding that our marriage would be fine. 

I have started giving myself sanity checks throughout the day. This whole experience has been so incredibly destructive to my sense of self that I have devised scripts that I say to him to basically check to make sure I'm not actually just overly emotional and overwhelmed about being 5 months pp trying to float our whole household on my income and that's why he has shut down and refuses to speak to me. 

I will ask him questions in a very casual way devoid of all emotion and see if he reacts the same way to that as when I come to him crying and begging him to hear me out (he usually tells me to go talk to my mom because he can't ""handle you right now""). I note his response and confirm to myself that it isn't the way I approach him. 

Guys I know this is fucked up. I know it's so fucked up. I am in it deep. I know that the only way out is to divorce him. I have consulted with lawyers and they agree that I likely won't get full custody. It will be 50/50. I also know this from my own experience as a child. When my brother was a toddler I witnessed my dad strangling my mother. He was overly physically abusive and would threaten to kill her. It went to court and he was still awarded 50/50 because it wasn't directed at my brother. 

So. I am here. Just getting off the phone with a lawyer about my options for a contested divorce and how much time I can realistically expect to get with my son. Heartbroken. Knowing that if I leave this situation as I should because I am a withering shell of a human being that I will be missing half of the life of the tiny baby I carried inside of me for 9 months and then birthed and loved. The light of my whole life. How did you do it? 

How did you get over that pain. I can take so much pain but the pain of being away from my baby is so intense. It stops me every single time I try to get the divorce moving. ",2025-03-05 19:36:26,2025-03-17 16:36:28,strangle

I just feel like it didn't count cause when he did it he didn't seem angry or enraged, he seemed cold and calm and calculated.

We have our own rooms. We get into arguments, and I'll admit, I haven't always been the best I can be during arguments.

And I don't feel like myself when I'm with him, I don't like who I am when I'm around him. Long story short, he's been making death threats, and has told me before he could definitely kill someone. He's an angry drunk, and when he gets too drunk, he gets violent. He's made death threats before but I never took them too seriously, but would also feel kind of scared because I do think he might be capable of it. A few weeks ago, we were arguing and he wrapped his hands around my neck to strangle me, right in front of our 2 year old son. He didn't squeeze, it was more intimidation, but it actually scared me. I've felt uneasy since then. Last night he got too drunk again, and we argued about how loud his music was at bedtime. He pulled out a knife not knowing I could see him, said ""F*** I'm going to kill her"" then stabbed his desk really hard. I said ""I'm calling the police"", then ran to my room. I could hear him come towards my room which scared me, but then he left while I was on the phone with 911. They arrested him. And part of me feels guilty because my son loves him so much and won't be able to see him, he's not always so terrible, he might be in jail for a long time, and he'll probably try and slander me in court. Court scares me, I haven't exactly been meek at all times, hence another reason I haven't reported him before. He can warp a situation and slander me and make things seem like what they're not.

I've played every single kingdom hearts game ( his favourite) as he told me what to do and how to play , I've finished BG3 ,three times now,  me on controls but him directing , every Mario, sonic or pokemon game in the last ten years I've played , not always finished but played , him always directing otherwise I won't play , I'm just not into it...

He's always had gamer rage , always . 
Yelling , mostly,  intense hours long screaming fits that result in him punching himself or the couch and losing his voice at worse .
He'll hold his breath alot too or hit his head against the wall, he'll scream and swear and he's strangled himself a few times in a rage ...always when the game doesn't go well or he loses or whatever. 

I was used to it until we moved in together and it got even worse .

It doesn't matter the game, it doesn't even matter if he is the one playing, or watching me play, sometimes watching me play hes gotten even angrier. He will rage .

For example - he was playing the Bluey game and the game glitches ALOT and he gets upset easily at things like that , but he screamed for long and so loudly I was scared the neighbours would call the police for a noise complaint. It was 11 at night after all and we in an apartment block with lots of families. 

It's not incomprehensible screaming , not all the time at least,  he'll scream about how the world is unfair,  games shouldn't be released unfinished or glitchey or broken, games just want to make him look bad and make him feel bad about himself , it's the game breaking or people cheating or the game deliberately making him lose , society is all about money and society just wants to make you feel bad ... things like that .

I've used to suggest putting the game down, walking away , it's just a game,  maybe stop playing... but he gets furious , he says he shouldn't have to stop playing , he should be able to do this , games were never this hard when he was a kid, society just made them hard to make more money. I shouldn't tell him what to do or how to feel.

I don't speak when he plays anymore  , if I speak it makes it worse , but sometimes me staying silent and still on the couch across the room from him makes it worse too, it's never consistent.  
If I leave the room when he's shouting it gets worse so it's easier to just stay there .

He says I shouldn't leave the room, that I'm abandoning him , that I just want to leave him if I can't handle him playing a video game , that he's allowed to feel his feelings and me walking away or staying silent and cowering is me denying him his feelings and making him feel bad .

So I just sit there and imagine I'm somewhere else or on the bad days I tell him I'm sick and stay in bed the whole day to avoid the living room where he plays ( our apartment is tiny and 3 rooms) at least I can sleep whilst he plays . He'll rage even when I stay in bed , just not as bad .

Other than the gamer rage he's an okay partner, I just don't feel like gamer rage qualifies as actual abuse? But I don't know anymore ...I don't know why he does it or why he doesn't just stop playing games if they upset him so much ... a Tv drama got too intense for me so I stopped watching it , ill only watch the nice episodes if I really really want to watch it again ( call the midwife) I don't understand why he can't do that as well?

I don't know...

I will always hate him for what he put me through. 

I will never forget begging him to stop saying he hates me, curling up in a ball while he yells at me for hours on end, sitting on the floor crying after he finished attacking me, feeling emotionally numb as I just waited for him to stop strangling me, feeling immense guilt anytime I tried fighting back, having my self esteem destroyed and blaming myself for the insecurities he gave me, loving him with all my heart even as he was telling me all the reasons he hated me. 

Now he's moved on to someone new while I'm left behind to build myself back up. He's told her how crazy I acted after the breakup, that's who I am now in their world, the crazy ex. I never won. ",2024-11-22 07:20:52,2025-03-17 16:37:47,strangle

After 6 hours of this exhaustion i caved in and said ok we will try and he will control his anger etc. I was tired and he still wanted to have sex. I said no at first and then could not say no as I was scared it will again cause a fight. 

I felt abused, violated, hurt, heartbroken,sick to my stomach to see a man I loved become ruthless, callous, remorseless.

Next day acting like everything is normal, not giving me the needed comfort, care love  and I still kept waiting for it, craving it. I feel so confused. 

Why do I want his care affection when he abused me in the first place? 
Why can't I just ghost or ignore him like he does to me? 
Why do I feel the need to explain to him that I need care, comforting, love so he does that to make things right?

1ivxd9w,I survived,PermissionGreen9798,9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ivxd9w/i_survived/,"I survived..

I remember when I met him, he was the perfect boyfriend ever, he got me gifts and flowers and give me so much attention and love, I thought he's the one and I'm gonna marry him in future. Later in relationship, one night we were drinking with our friends from work and watching football and I took his phone to take a photo and then accidentally  discovered he was texting to his ex girlfriend, I read messages while I was sitting next to him, he was telling her how much he misses her, that he wants to get back together with her, that she's the only girl he ever loved and stuff like that. I got so angry and confronted him about it right away and he just said we will talk later. I said okay but I couldn't act like nothing is going on and I distanced myself from him right away meanwhile he was acting like nothing happened, he was hugging me, holding my hand, tried to kiss me couple times while I was refusing and trying constantly to move away from him. Then he got up and said let's go to my room to talk so I went with him. And that was the night I should've left him for good and stopped everything with him. In the room he was trying to manipulate me saying ""That's just the way I was trying to leave her, I couldn't leave her just over night, you don't understand we were together for couple of years ... "" and that made me even more angry because he said he's single and that they broke up long ago and he told me that they did brake up long ago but they still had contact and some kind of weird relationship between them and that's the way he was trying to put an end on it. I didn't believe any of things he said, I was still very angry with him, I wanted to leave him and to go home. That's when he started to get little aggressive and saying that I annoy him with my behavior and that he doesn't fear anybody except Allah (he's muslim) and that his God will protect him and take care of him despite whatever he did in life, he's not scared of police or anything except his God. I was terrified with that things he said because he said it like he's going to do something to me and I got scared really quick and wanted even more to go home and so I started telling him everything is okay and I'm just tired and I wanna go home because I'm working tomorrow. That's when he punched the table in front of me and told me to stop acting like I was scared of him and like he's going to hurt me or whatever and I thought to myself..well he had couple of drinks, he's hurt and probably don't wanna lose me, he's a good guy that's just alcohol, I can help him, I think he loves me and stuff.. So I calmed him down little by little, I told him that I know he won't hurt me ever because I know he loves me and he really calmed down and sat next to me and we hugged some time and kissed, and when everything cooled off I went home. After that he really broke off everything with his ex, told her that he met me and that he loves me (He showed me messages) and everything went back to normal. He was again that perfect guy and I fell in love even more. We had beautiful relationship, we took care of each other, supported each other and we were very much in love and almost always together. We also worked at the same place, except I had day shift cause I was waitress and he was working nights cause he was in bakery. He lived in rooms next to our workplace and everytime I slept at his place he was checking up on me every chance he had and it was pretty nice. He would come on break in the middle of the night and cover me while I was sleeping with blanket, If I woke up he would ask me if I was hungry or thirsty or do I need anything. He was perfect. After couple of months something changed in him, it's like he started drinking,  acting possessive, wanted me to he with him 24/7, he wouldn't let me go home change my stuff or take some other clothes to wear, he would just wash it there and say "" I washed your clothes here they are clean you can wear them, no need to go home "" and I was like well I wanna wear something else, I don't wanna be always in the same clothes, and he always responded something like "" i don't care what you wear I love you the way you are, that doesn't matter to me "" . And he knew exactly how to melt my heart ( manipulate me ) so I didn't see how crazy all of that was, I was working at a place where he was constantly there checking up on me and then after work spend time with him and sleep at his place. After a week or two I really was little tired and wanted to have some me time so I can do skin care or something else, I just wanted to be little alone and at my home and I left, and every time I left he was acting like he misses me, he was texting me like he was depressed because I'm not there and I was like babe chill I just went home it's perfectly normal like we're gonna see each other tomorrow. But he kept saying stuff like that and somehow manipulated me to go back to his place or he will come to mine. I still loved me but It became too much for me to be constantly with him, I was feeling like I was trapped or in a cage cause I couldn't go anywhere or do anything. And as I started to go more home and distanced myself from him, he then started to put pressure on me that he wants us to get married, have kids start a family move in together and stuff, and I always said it's too early cause I was like 21 and he was 25 at the time, we were so young for that, I wasn't ready to start married life and have family. After a while he started drinking, like every day, he stopped sleeping, was always with his friend at bars drinking. I was always there for him cause I knew he has rough time, I just didn't know why and I just was there for him and waited for him to open up so I can help him, I didn't wanted to put any pressure on him. As the time went by, he was changing his behavior more and more and was drunk every day, he would get up and instead of breakfast he would just open a bottle of beer and started day with that and then continue till evening to drink. He was at the time still putting pressure on me, still was acting possessive and got jealous over nothing, he was paranoid and stuff, I didn't wanted to argue cause he was drunk all the time and I didn't wanted to make him mad cause I was scared of him. I was planning to slowly distance myself from him and eventually I would end the relationship. I wasn't feeling it anymore and person I fall for wasn't there anymore,  he was totally different and I didn't know who that person was and I just wanted to leave mostly because he was drinking too much. And I think he also knew that, he knew deep down. One day, our mutual friend was leaving the country and we wanted to meet all together and have couple of drinks and say goodbye. I was home getting ready and texting him all the time and just by vibes on texts it seemed like something was off. I called him and we spoke, and I asked him was he drinking today and he swore that he wasn't and that he had just like 1 beer, but I could tell he was drunk but decided to still meet with him cause I wanted to say goodbye to my friend and have some drinks myself. We meet later in a bar near our workplace and since he came I noticed he was waisted, I whispered to him and asked why he lied to me and he said he didn't and that he wasn't drunk at all, but he could barely talk normally. I was still little mad but I decided I'm not going to let him ruin my mood and was chilling. There were parents and two children from our mutual friend and that friend also and we were hanging and talking, and it was fun. At one point of the evening my boyfriend gave some money to the kids and started saying to me "" give them something, don't be like that, they are just little kids, how can you be like that "" and I was confused because I first off didn't do anything and I really didn't had money on me, I was always paying everything with card. And he knew that very well. Then he started putting money in my pockets and saying to me out loud like "" here you go, I'm gonna give you money since you don't have, just give it to the kids its nice thing to do "" and he kept saying that in way like I had something against the kids and I was very confused and asked him what is his problem, I told him I don't have anything against the kids and asked him to stop making me look bad in front of others. Then he started saying to me that I stop with my behavior, that I always ruin everything, he was asking me to be normal just this night and not to make drama or something, and that made me so mad cause I could tell he was ghosting me into thinking I'm the problem and like it's my fault and It never was. So I got up and said I'm gonna go home and then he pulled me from the table and told me to go, he threw my bag in front of me and shouted at me to leave, that I was this and this, so I picked my bag and I left. And guess what, he left right away with me, behind the bar he started yelling at me and I had enough at that point I was just like ""okay you're right, I'm just gonna go home we're over"". And then he hit me, he slapped me so hard and I remember at the moment that I couldn't believe that just happened, I remember just looking at him and  being completely shocked. I wanted to leave immediately but he started pulling me for my hair and hands and slapping me even more, and I was definitely making noise with every slap I got, but nobody did anything, nobody came to stop him. He started dragging me back to his place and I remember all the time he was telling me "" I'm gonna kill you when we get home. This is the last time you did this to me. I'm gonna kill you now I swear to Allah I am not afraid of anything I'm gonna kill you when we come home, you're dead "" and that scared me so much I sarted to pull and try to escape so badly but he kept hitting me and was stronger and bigger then me so I couldn't escpae. There were also some people passing on the street and only one them said something like ' leave the girl alone ' and he responded ' she's mine. I can do whatever I want with her' and that's it, nobody did anything,  everyone was just passing and looking like it was nothing going on while he was threatening me and hitting me on the street while I was trying to escape from him. We were close to his place and I knew that if I go up to that room I'm going to die, and I knew that I have to escape no matter what cause I don't wanna die, I kept thinking don't give up, if you go up there you're going to die, nobody can help you. When we came near the workplace, right in front of the stairs that led upstairs to his place I started pulling even more, I gathered every peace of strength I had and pulled away, he threw me on the ground and started strangling me right there on spot.. I remember it like it was yesterday.. I couldn't breathe, I felt so scared, like never before, I looked right at his eyes while he was strangling me and I didn't see anything, his eyes were empty, it looked like there was nobody behind them, like there's no person behind those eyes, pure emptiness. That scared me much more and while I was trying to defend myself and pulling his hands from my neck I kicked the pile of of boxes with empty bottles of drinks we served at restaurant and that made a huge noise. People from the garden ( the guests ) started looking around to see what happened and he saw that they are going to see him strangling me and as soon as felt he was distracted I pushed him and started yelling "" help he's trying to kill me! "" 
I couldn't yell loud cause I was trying at the same time to catch a breath but somehow I gathered strength to yell even louder every time cause I knew that was my only chance to escape this man. So the people heard me and came right away and I ran to them and started crying and shaking and I remember he was saying to them I was overreacting, that I was his girl and that I was drunk and he's just trying to get me home to bed and I was right away started yelling that he's lying and that he tried to kill me. People believed me cause I was covered in bruises, my hair was messy and half plucked. My coworker's at the time got me inside of restaurant and tried to calm me down and help me, they called the police and boss cause it happened inside of his property and I was just there.. Shaking, crying, I couldn't believe that actually happened, I couldn't believe that I could die, it all seemed like a horror movie.. They were all there asking me what happened, am I okay and I couldn't talk properly, I just fell into shock. After some time, police came and took me to hospital and I told them what happened. Later I found out he escaped right away from there and that police couldn't find him. My brother picked me up from hospital and took me home and stayed with me to watch for me in case he comes to my home and tries to hurt me. I was scared for my life. I kept thinking he's going to come back to finsih what he started, he's even more angrier now, he's going to find me and kill me. Day after I found out police arrested him, I also found out he got fired and left that place where he lived and went back to his country. Before that I heard from him once and saw him outside, he was sleeping on the street and benches and I offered him to come to my place to take a shower cause he was so dirty and looking really bad and I felt bad so I did the most stupid thing ever, and I did took him to my home but I first made a call to my roommates and neighborsso they know and can protect me if he tries anything. I washed his clothes, let him wash himself and warmed him enough and let him go, and I told him then this is the last time he sees me, and that I can't forgive or forget what he did to me, he apologized to me and told me he love me but I just couldn't forgive him for that so I escorted him out from my house and never saw him again after that. I also didn't press any charges, only the state sentenced him and deported him back to his country. And that's the end, after some time I got back on my job and started living normal life. But to this day I remember everything, every word, every emotion absolutely everything from that day... today is two years after that happened and I'm still single, I think about that very often, and sometimes I can't believe that actually happened, it's like unreal. But I know it did, and I survived. I fucking survived. And I'm gonna keep on living because I deserve it. I look back and now I know I should've break up long before all that, but who can blame me? I was in love and manipulated. But I survived, I don't know if I will ever date again, or trust a man for that matter, but I will keep living and telling people my story. And I hope that nobody experience this, not one woman should experience this, I pray for all women across the world to be safe and take care and protect themselves from man like this. üôè‚úùÔ∏è",2025-02-23 00:26:30,2025-03-17 16:37:53,strangle

The first one involved physical violence, my partner would strangle me and injure me when we argued. He also sexually abused me and made sexual contact with me against my will. 

The next one was very emotionally abusive, very religious, he would always make me feel ‚Äúless than‚Äù him because he was ‚Äúholier‚Äù than me and it was his job to ‚Äúguide me‚Äù into being holier. He was a youth chastity minister, and yet cheated on me multiple times in our relationship and then said I was ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù because I expressed issue with him cheating on me with multiple women. 

But now I‚Äôm with my current partner. I don‚Äôt know if he really has my best interest at heart sometimes. I don‚Äôt know if he is just ‚Äúimperfect‚Äù because he is human or if I am really with another abuser. 

Whenever I bring problems to him or ask for his help, he normally doesn‚Äôt help me the first few times. He‚Äôll act like the conversation didn‚Äôt happen. Or sometimes he will laugh and say that I don‚Äôt really need that kind of help or support.

And implies that I‚Äôm in the wrong or mean or lazy or demanding for asking him. He is very scary when he gets this level of mad. He slams things. Slams his fists on the counter. Slams doors, yells very loud and erratically. He‚Äôll get very close to me when he gets angry and it scares and overwhelms me. Then I suffer in silence for a time. Try to do everything myself and shame myself for asking him to begin with. Then it becomes too much to carry eventually and I blow a gasket and I start getting distant from him and angry. And as soon as I start emotionally distancing myself from him, he all of a sudden wants to do all the things I asked me to help me with months ago. And then I get angrier and say ‚Äúwhy are you doing these things now that I‚Äôm halfway out the door?‚Äù Why don‚Äôt you do things the first time I ask you for help?‚Äù And then he says that I am unpredictable, mean, explosive, impatient, and demanding him to be perfect. He then insists that he loves me and then buys me all these lavish big gifts that I never asked for. 80% of the time these conversations revolve around me asking him help with housework, chores, and making my doctor‚Äôs appointments. 

Besides this, I wouldn‚Äôt say he is ‚Äúabusive‚Äù he has done good things for me too here and there. He financially supported me when I had become homeless for a short time (thru no fault of my own) in the past. 

But sometimes I feel like he expects me to do everything for him and baby him and get the bare minimum in return. And I‚Äôm expected to be perfectly happy about it. 

And then the cycle continues every single time like this.

1ht6yjx,I realized I'm the problem,areyoume401,13,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ht6yjx/i_realized_im_the_problem/,"I wrote about my experience with DV in another post. I thought I was the victim until the other night.

My ex and I decided to start seeing each other again and things were going well. We decided to stop drinking together unless it's a cocktail or two every now and then. We went out after Christmas and ran into an acquaintance who bought himself and I shots (my SO turned down said shot- I was not within earshot of the convo prior to the drink ordering). I felt obliged to take the shot and ngl, was also just feeling fun and fresh and thought one shot couldn't hurt. I took the shot and then found out the contents were the equivalent of a shot of absinthe???

My ex and I were fine. That was the only shot I'd had besides beer each. We were invited to a Xmas party with his closest friends who I was very excited to see because I haven't hung out with them since we broke up a year ago. I remember everything being cool. I was having fun and then \*bam\* I remember nothing. Next thing I know, I'm in a parking lot on the phone with my brother. Flash forward, I'm in my ex's bedroom throwing a shoe at him and he's recording me and asking me to leave.

The next morning, I woke up in his bed and he said I needed to get dressed and leave. I told him I have no idea what happened. He explained that I lost all the light in my eyes and made all of his friends at the party uncomfortable by asking them how many people he's had sex with, telling them to fuck off when they comforted me, and then ultimately throwing punches at him and screaming bloody murder when he tried to get me home that ""I want to hang out with his friends"". When he drove me home, apparently I tried jumping out of the car several times. He said he had to grab me by the hair and pull me to the passenger seat to stop me from jumping out of the car.

The next day I couldn't move my head. My neck is still kinked 3 days later. I have bruises all over my body including a sprained wrist and my hair fell out in chunks in the shower. My mother asked me on Christmas why I have a handprint bruise on my arm and I laughed it off because I just feel now like I deserve everything that happens to me. I've woken up every day feeling like a piece of shit who doesn't deserve to be alive. The only thing keeping me here is my the fact that I know how much my family loves me.

I made the choice to hang out with him, I took the shot, I threw punches, I made people uncomfortable. And when I think back to my last incident, I threw the first punch too and then he retaliated by strangling me. I don't know what to believe about myself or about this situation.

I don't know if I'm seeking help here or for someone to tell me yes, I deserve this.",2025-01-04 05:02:05,2025-03-17 16:38:00,strangle
1ix4zuo,Can't take any more,Existing-Jello8744,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ix4zuo/cant_take_any_more/,"Sorry this is going to be a very long one. Never posted on this site before I am just a reader. But I am at my wits end. I suffered domestic abuse for 15 years, threats to my family, friends if I left. (It got to the point the threats to my own life didn't matter anymore - I would have welcomed death as a way out) I was absolutely trapped, terrified and isolated. I have a child with this man, luckily the most amazing mature kid I could only have wished for, who I protected from seeing as much as I could. I begged for help from police, I knew I was in more danger leaving than when I was putting up with the abuse. Not just me at risk, but everyone I love.

 This man did the most cruel things to me through our relationship. Made me dig my own grave, strangled and beat me more times than I could count, attempted to stab me, shaved my hair off, broke my bones, beat me into losing a baby, made me quit my job, stop seeing friends, stop seeing family, was racist and violent toward my family, things I couldn't even imagine putting someone through. It was daily torture. His poor mother even took her own life as a result of his abuse and the constant mental torment of his actions to everyone else. 

 I managed to leave 6 years ago with the help and support of police, social workers, to sadly end up still living in a cycle of abuse and isolation, due to his threats. It should have been my time to heal but instead I felt more trapped than ever. I got restraining orders, he broke them, I had to have my letterbox sealed as he threatened to burn my house down and had to have alarms fit incase he came to attack me. I had no way of moving out of our hometown, I got constantly harrassed and abused to the point I tried to take my own life as my only way out.

Fast forward to 3 years ago and the abuse and threats were there but more infrequent as he would get arrested every time contact was made, (a slap on the wrist and let out again). Each time he ""slipped through the net"". I wasn't allowed to move house, wasn't allowed to move on in a relationship, he told our child he would never accept me being with anyone else and that was ""the choice I made having a kid with him"" - it meant I had to either be ""a family"" with threats, mental and physical abuse, or be on my own forever. Then he made some awful threats to her about me, said some awful things, which resulted in him being stopped contact as the social workers agreed that it was very detrimental and she was a pawn in his abuse. I spent every day looking over my shoulder, scared to even walk down the street incase he saw me and ran me over, scared to do anything that involved leading a normal life. 

I started a long road of healing myself with no idea where to start, I was consumed with fear but also a determination that I was ALMOST there, I was almost free of his clutches, every time he was arrested it was closer to him going to jail, every time he left me alone for a couple of months I regained a bit more strength and self love. I got my friends back, I got my life back, I even went on holiday with my old school friend, something I never thought I'd get a chance to do. I was becoming stronger, and more free by the day.

Then, I met a guy. 

Someone I never expected or planned to fall for, but god, I did. I consumed myself with love and happiness and found myself again, found someone I instantly and truly felt like I could love, trust, and let my walls down that were so high. The threats were still here and there but 6 years after a breakup? Who shouldn't move on after that amount of time? 

So I did. And I was happy. For the first time I saw my future with love and happiness, not fear and threats.

Then.. not even year into our relationship, my ex attacked him. Viciously and callously with no remorse or regard for life. He stabbed him, multiple times, all over his body, in his face, and made sure I heard and saw everything he had done. Luckily through numerous operations he survived, healed well, despite lasting scars and trauma. 

Now my life is upside down. My child's father is in jail, where he belongs, but a good man was hurt in the process. He is traumatised, I am traumatised, we wanted to be together, despite all this, we wanted to make it work, but now after everything, we can't fathom our way through our mental struggles that this has caused. I totally understand why he would struggle to be with me now, who wouldn't? But we convinced ourselves we could get through it, and we did the hard bit, but now, almost a year later, we have both reached a point we can't continue with the arguments and stress that we both bring to eachother with our own mental health. He has been unfaithful since, which I forgave him for multiple times as I know how his life has been turned upside down, and I tried to understand his low points,  but it has brought added stress and arguments. I have done everything possible to stand by him, help him, support him, I have foregone my own mental health to focus on his, I have never made it about me and my abuse, I didnt want to dismiss what he has been through. I just think that even I am now a lasting reminder of nearly losing his life, despite his love for me, it can't replace the trauma and I don't blame him, I'm struggling too so I can only imagine what he went through that day, and since. It's just hard because we really do love eachother, we laugh like best friends when times are good, but now things are more bad than good and it's reached a point of no return, despite both of us really wanting it to work. He has therapy once every 2 weeks but feels as though it makes him worse, dragging the memories back up that he is trying to bury. I know that no amount of burying emotions works and you have to work through them. But the more I push for this the more he would push away. He isn't a ""talk to strangers"" kind of guy despite how much I think talking helps. 

I don't know what I expect by writing this, but I needed to rant, write, whatever I could do to actually fathom how my life has ended up like this. Everyone struggles and everyone has their own life, but I really do wonder when mine will give me a break. There has been investigations within the police to see why this was even able to get to this point, I have had apologies, I have had excuses, but nothing matters now, it's all too late. 

I wrote su*cide letters to my family incase I can't hang on much longer, and I know people's first thought is selfish - her child has already lost her dad. But this is anything but. When he comes out of jail for what he has done, not even a handful of years, he will only repeat the abuse and I can not risk anyone else hurt, because of a relationship I got trapped into from 17 years old. It has already taken my life until now, I can't help but think maybe if I weren't here anymore, he would finally feel satisfied and atleast my loved ones could live free, and happy. My parents are amazing, they love my daughter like their own, she is probably bonded more with them as the years I spent trapped they helped raise her as to protect her from the abuse.

 Please don't think I am selfish, I am just lost. ",2025-02-24 15:42:59,2025-03-17 16:38:01,strangle
1hw4rm8,What is IPV Strangulation?,Longjumping_Talk_123,5,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hw4rm8/what_is_ipv_strangulation/,"I apologize if this is a dumb question or has already been answered.

I guess I am wondering what constitutes ""strangulation"" that increases the risk of Domestic Homicide. I understand you do not have to lose consciousness, it does not have to be just by hands, and it does not have to be fatal. However, when I hear that the risk of Domestic Homicide is seven times more likely when your partner strangles you, I get a bit confused (or maybe in denial?).

Does it include sexual strangulation? Or, I guess, ""affectionate strangulation?"" (I get the feeling this involves consent- nobody consents to violent, painful strangulation I understand. I mean more so like consenting to choking as a kink).

I struggle with this because my ex partner and I had talked about choking as an intimate practice. I said I was okay with it, he said he was very skilled in it (he was very sex positive and knowledgeable about sex and kink, I was not. He was recovering from sex addiction and working with a sex-informed therapist). He never once choked me in bed, but he did choke me in public once that really stuck out to me. He took me to a dead aisle in a supermarket, looked around, grabbed the front of my neck so tightly it stung and pulled me in for a kiss (this is the ""affectionate strangulation"" he talked about). His teeth were gritted and it was a shock for me (and kind of embarrassing, like we should not be doing this in a grocery store). I don't feel like this counts as strangulation to be worried about because maybe he just thought he was being kinky and we had agreed to choking in the bedroom. I am very confused about it.

Some further context as to why he might have only meant it as a fun ""public"" kink (we never agreed on doing things in public, except for in the woods, but maybe he got confused): He would also make me grab things off the bottom shelf or would drop things and make me pick them up in public, and then he would look around and thrust into my backside (which I also found embarrassing). He would force me to smack his ass in public (I would say no (especially if there were kids around), he would repeatedly say ""do it, do it, do it"" with increasing pressure until I did he would withhold affection). Lastly, he would ask to do compromising intimate acts with me, like he wanted to ""put it in"" under the blanket while his mom was talking to us, he wanted me to take off my top when I would drop him off outside his front door (after ignoring me the entire car ride), he tried to finger me in front of his dog, and I once gave him head while another couple was having a really heated argument to take his mind off it so he wouldn't be stressed and think less of me for bringing him around stress.

TLDR; I feel like maybe he wasn't as violent or scary as I made him out to be and maybe I am just bitter because he discarded me and it was short-term (I sometimes struggle believing abuse could escalate like that over such a short period). I also struggle to know what is dangerous strangulation and what is just ""kinky"" strangulation- what constitutes the strangulation that increases your risk of DH and what is ""harmless"" or ""playful"" strangulation my ex talked about?",2025-01-07 23:02:15,2025-03-17 16:38:02,strangle
1hsw7ul,started a short story about my life. is it worth continuing or a waste of time? be honest,JadenMavia,7,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hsw7ul/started_a_short_story_about_my_life_is_it_worth/,"Prologue



‚ÄúHe tried to choke me‚Äù is an incorrect statement. Choking is when someone can‚Äôt breathe because something is INSIDE their throat. The correct statement is ‚Äúhe was strangling me‚Äù. Strangling is when someone squeezes the OUTSIDE of the throat. Important distinction. Crazy how many people aren‚Äôt aware of it.



This is the story about he who shall not be named (Harry Potter reference from a 33 year old of course) and how his story became my story.¬†



He had a bad childhood, the abusive father, the toxic home, the jumping from shelter to shelter type. By the time I met him, he had a stable career, and seemed to have made the most from the bad hand he was dealt. You‚Äôd think a past like that would make someone that much more careful to turn things around. You‚Äôd think‚Ä¶well, I thought. Instead, it was the classic case of the abused becoming the abuser.



Once someone is abused, their brain physically changes. Not just the way they think, but their actual brain. I think I was aware of when mine was changing. When I started dissociating and forgetting what I did the day before. When I blocked out entire days and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn‚Äôt remember them. When I‚Äôd write lists when shopping, otherwise I‚Äôd forget what I needed. Or the worst was when I‚Äôd forget an ingredient or a crucial step when cooking. I used to love cooking.



Abuse was an unknown concept for me, I was blessed with a beautiful childhood. I have my husband to thank for showing me how dark the world can really be. I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself, let me start from the beginning.

It has been about 6 months since successfully getting out. I didn‚Äôt think I could do it and I did. It all came to a head one day. He ran at me and punched me hard in the back while I was getting ready for work and it hurt. After years of abuse of all kinds, much more severe than this, I wonder why a random unprompted punch was enough to make up my mind. 

While I was at work I texted my dad, ‚ÄúYou need to get me out of here.‚Äù Long story short, I was with my lawyer and the police until 2am that night. He harassed me with phone calls, feigned confusion and innocence, switched between rage and being ‚Äúhurt‚Äù. I cried the entire time about how I knew he would feel so betrayed and confused but I did it anyway. They took photos of my back with bruises, screenshots of his abusive and threatening texts (including ones admitting he had strangled me before), photos of other injuries. He was in and out of court and police custody. He wanted me to return his illegal firearm to him. I reported that to the police as well. I did everything I could to build the case. The police had prior record of domestic dispute calls by neighbors to our address. I had so many photos. At the hearing for the restraining order, his only question was, ‚ÄúWhen does it expire?‚Äù 

I did not go to his criminal hearing, but submitted a statement recommending against the offender program. He‚Äôd already been in therapy for years and I knew he‚Äôd find a way to manipulate everyone and learn nothing. My lawyer helped me recommend jail time to him hoping it‚Äôd teach him a lesson or at least keep him physically away. I was enjoying my life without him. 

I found out several weeks ago that the court assigned him the program, no jail time. And since then I have been immediately spiraling. How do I ever feel safe again? He‚Äôs a narcissistic, malignant genius. He‚Äôll weasel his way out of everything and will learn nothing. I don‚Äôt feel safe anymore and I don‚Äôt know what to do. He is so vindictive and he always was so adamant about not being taken to court. I feel like he is counting down the days until he can come and fucking get me and I don‚Äôt know what to do.  I feel like I will never feel safe again and honestly am wondering if all i did was even worth it. I‚Äôm sorry this is so rambly. I just needed to get it out. My therapist left the state months ago and I just haven‚Äôt been able to get established with someone else since. I just feel so alone and terrified and desperately wish I had never let it get to this point ",2025-02-13 03:14:02,2025-03-17 16:38:05,strangle
