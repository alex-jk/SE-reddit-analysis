1jcsdmi,Kids afraid of adults,Careful-Physics-7578,1,2025-03-16 18:40:48+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jcsdmi/kids_afraid_of_adults/,"We are currently away from my husband, in the early stage of divorce, with restraining order in effect. I am aiming to have majority of custody of our 2 kids. Restraint order is for coercive control, rough handling of kids, severe yelling/berating of kids. Recently my 4 year old has been showing fear of other caregivers, including me and my mother. We however are not abusive with him. He recently told me to be nice to his little sibling. and that I was scaring his sibling, he was afraid I would hurt him. Another time my mother went to take a toy from the toddler, because he was being rough with it. 4 year old ran, as if to protect my toddler, and grabbed my mother‚Äôs hands. 
To me, he has learned to be afraid of caregivers. On top of how I want him to feel safe and secure, I am worried he will express these fears to a parenting evaluator. Has anyone experienced this? Of course I reiterate to him that I would never hurt him or his sibling, and I‚Äôm hoping over time, and away from his dad, he will feel safer. I can‚Äôt help but be worried dad has created problems that will actually work against us, despite me efforts to keep everyone safe. "

In October 2024 we got into an argument, he went to slap me but I pulled back. He destroyed the room broke all work computers and the TV. Said he‚Äôll never do that! Dec 2024 he was drinking , I said something to upset him he spit on me , threw stuff out of the house , grabbed me like in a choke hold claims bc I was going to hit him. Never have I attempted to hit him , I‚Äôm very or made any gesture for him to think that. 
Jan 2025 we get back and he blames the breakup bc of me. Till this day he blames me . Bc when he spit on me and kept spitting on me I did text my adult son to come , no I couldn‚Äôt call the cops. He‚Äôll take the phone from me ,so I would walk away and text my son quickly and hide the phone. My son came and the only reason he smacked him was bc he heard from outside my bf . He wasn‚Äôt going todo anything but tell him to go. So bc of this my bf blames me , everything is my fault the breakup and why we‚Äôre not living together  or good as we should be. 

My thing is, is there a chance he‚Äôll never do it again do they continue doing this??? He said sorry once and bc I said hey you know what you did so it‚Äôs your fault as well. Idk what to do it‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt take accountability. üòì i do love him idk if I can walk away . IIwas fine in Feb when we separated and then he comes back . "
1jcmj5f,what proof do I need for custody battle,Lakewater22,2,2025-03-16 14:22:36+00:00,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jcmj5f/what_proof_do_i_need_for_custody_battle/,"
I‚Äôm in Georgia. He‚Äôs also a fucking attorney. And also my boss. 

He pays me pennys. He won‚Äôt help me buy a car after mine broke. 

He doesn‚Äôt help with anything. Like we had twins and I‚Äôm so exhausted doing this nearly alone with maybe a couple hours of break on random sundays. I need alone time. Desperately. 

I could list a novel of abuses. But I don‚Äôt even want to. 

We are not married. What proof do I need to get to the court to make sure he has the least amount of contact with the kids as possible after we leave. Like I literally cannot have him with the kids alone. I do not trust him. 

One twin has 3 different meds 6x a day‚Ä¶. He doesn‚Äôt even know the name of the meds let alone doses or doctors. Has never tried to learn or help. Hasn‚Äôt washed a bottle or made formula. 

Our son has 11 specialists. He hasn‚Äôt been to one appt. I‚Äôm juggling this alone borrowing cars from people. 

I am so proud of myself finally ready to leave. 

He‚Äôs abusive every way but physically. And it‚Äôs gotten so extreme. I just want to run away with the kids but need to get things in order first. 

What do I need to do? I researched a women‚Äôs shelter nearby. 

Idk how I can call, pretty sure there are cameras in the house. Can probably borrow my grams car to speak with someone there. 

Crazy thing is it‚Äôs my house/rental agreement, but of course he won‚Äôt leave because ‚Äúhe has tenant rights‚Äù. I‚Äôm supposed to resign the lease soon and idk if I will. I‚Äôll never find somewhere cheaper to live, but I need away from him and need him out. Sad. I love my landlord. 

Ugh. 

The only thing holding me back is him having any custody of the kids. If I knew for certain he couldn‚Äôt we‚Äôd leave everything behind right now. I guess I need to gather proof but idk what proof even. Like. Do I put cameras in my house, that‚Äôs legal in my state. 

Do I get a voice recorder, what kind??????

I feel like I should have been gathering evidence a month ago. But ugh. 

He cannot accept our son Down syndrome. The other day he told me of an intrusive thought of putting g habanero pepper on his tongue because he‚Äôs always sticking it out. Our son is 5 months old. 

I wish I had that recorded. 

I‚Äôm afraid he will harm our son. "

1jclc96,looking back at my teenage relationship TW: SA,misformambo,1,2025-03-16 13:22:51+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jclc96/looking_back_at_my_teenage_relationship_tw_sa/,"he was younger than me by 1.5 years, we were in the same grade at school.  i was at one point legally an adult and he was still a minor but that doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt abuse me. i think i couldn‚Äôt accept what was happening because i was the adult, i was supposed to be the more mature one, i was supposed to be able to stand up for myself. i know now that it wasn‚Äôt my fault, that what he did was not okay and not right and i did not deserve to be treated that way by anyone.

i don‚Äôt like to label people as narcissistic because of all the stigma that comes with it but i wish that at some point during the abuse i looked up signs of narcissistic abuse, that i had listened to other‚Äôs stories and experiences because when i finally did seek out those stories, i was taken aback by how textbook his behaviours were and how many other people had experienced the exact same thing i had and it made me for the first time since meeting him feel like i wasn‚Äôt on my own.

tw: sexual abuse
sometimes i have flashbacks of small things that happened and instead of feeling disgusted in myself, i feel angry. that might not seem like a step in the right directed but before now i had never let myself be angry, i had made excuses for his behaviour and made myself the bad guy because he made me believe i was.

there were points where the name calling, the public humiliation and belittlement, the constant emotional rejection and sparingly given slivers of ‚Äòlove‚Äô would build up and i would explode. this would happen every month or so, where i stopped being a punching bag and told him that what he was doing was wrong and it was hurting me and i didn‚Äôt deserve it. i had never been truely angry before i met this man, had never felt pure resentment and rage towards someone before. i was proud of myself for telling him how i felt but every time i did, he would play the victim and say i was abusing him by being angry at him for what he was doing to me. 

this is the part that truely disgusts me: when i didn‚Äôt cave from him playing the victim, he would quickly shift to egging me on, making me more frustrated, then he would tell me how hot i was when i was mad, how much it turned him on and how much he liked it. then we would have sex, rough sex like we were fighting and whenever he tried to initiate this i would be too disgusted with him to even remotely feel like doing that but then he‚Äôd keep pushing and pushing until i was too emotionally exhausted to stop saying no. 

i don‚Äôt even know if i was raped or if that counts as rape, because i still feel the tiniest bit at fault as i was the one in that moment being mad and yelling for once.

i later learned that this is called reactive abuse and that it was a response that he too eagerly wanted to see from me.

I now have a partner who truely loves me, who could never dream of intentionally hurting me, who apologises even when their nose accidentally pokes my eye when we kiss.

i never fully realised the toxicity of that relationship until i was given this pure care and respect by my new partner. i am so grateful i found them because they have helped me rewrite all the bad memories with good ones and that was something that therapy couldn‚Äôt do for me in the way i needed.

i hope everyone here comes to feel some sense of peace and contentment, that you find the strength to go on and that you find people who genuinely care and love you"
1jcjw6p,"as it turns out, major trauma has major effects",Alarmed_Worry5555,5,2025-03-16 12:00:03+00:00,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jcjw6p/as_it_turns_out_major_trauma_has_major_effects/,"i feel so isolated in everything i‚Äôve been through. even knowing that other people have been through it, its usually straight cis women being abused by their straight male partners and it feels so deeply isolating 

im a trans gay man, my abuser was cis and ‚Ä¶idk bi or maybe just gay. (not really sure because he said he was bi when i met him and was still with his baby mama but later started implying he was just gay. but that could‚Äôve just been him saying that to throw me off the idea of him cheating on me with a woman.) doesn‚Äôt really matter either way ig, but it adds this whole extra layer to the abuse he put me through

whenever i started acting a way he didn‚Äôt like (like, showing emotion or asking him to give me basic aftercare, how fucking dare i) he would start saying im acting like a ‚Äúfemale‚Äù. 
in the aftermath of strangling me he told me he ‚Äúnever would have put his hands on me if i was a female‚Äù

its so obvious he only saw me as half a man at best. a weaker, inferior version of a man that he could rationalize and justify taking his anger and violence and aggression out on but was still ultimately beneath him, because of my femininity.

the first two months of our relationship were spent with him hiding me from everyone in his life. partially because he was cheating on me and his baby mama at the same time, and i think also partially because he was ashamed to be seen with me. even in places where nobody knew him, nobody would recognize him, he would make me wait in the car and go into shops alone. 
eventually he did make a point of introducing me to some of his coworkers but i honestly think the only reason he did that was because he ended up breaking up with her at some point (thats a whole other can of worms i dont want to open) and was trying to like. idk prove himself to me or something. it felt like the biggest deal in the world at the time but it probably meant nothing to him. 
he never took me out on a date. not once. he promised me he would. he always swore he would. but he never did. it was never important enough to him to make the time so it never happened. or maybe he just didnt want to be bothered or didnt want to be seen with someone like me in public. 

its just so hard. especially when he made a point to always use my correct pronouns and name. as he‚Äôs getting arrested, he calls me his boyfriend to the police. i wonder sometimes if he said that because he knew my mom could hear everything from the other line of the phone call, or if that‚Äôs how he really saw me. i guess it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference either way. its so hard to feel like i‚Äôm finally seen and desired and loved for who i am just to have it all ripped away from me and it just be a facade. i thought for once someone loved me FOR ME, not in spite of me. i‚Äôm not convinced that love will ever find me. it was supposed to be him. i was supposed to be his handsome boy i was supposed to be his boyfriend, his fianc√©, his husband. he told me once i was the cutest guy he‚Äôd seen in the world and he wanted to be together forever. how can you say everything i‚Äôve ever wanted to hear from the same mouth that drips such cruelty and venom for my very identity and soul? 

i feel so alone and isolated in this experience in general, but it just compounds so much more when nobody i‚Äôve talked to really understands or seems to care that queer and trans people get abused too 
its like we don‚Äôt matter at all
the police and courts have misgendered, disrespected and dismissed me every step of the way no matter how many times i correct them politely 
its exhausting 

i just want someone to understand what i‚Äôm going through. the severity and intensity of it all. how deeply it affected every aspect of my personhood, my identity, my life, my personality, everything. i feel like a completely different person and i‚Äôll never be the same. and nobody understands that. 

my parents expect me to be able to act rationally, logically, patiently to emotional situations but i can‚Äôt do it anymore like i used to. it all just comes out, i have no impulse control anymore when it comes to being triggered. its like i can‚Äôt stop myself from doing or saying things. and i know a lot of it isnt exactly easy for them to deal with and my mom has been patient but its almost like they expect nothing to have changed. and its so hard to feel that pressure to act ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and over it and hold it together and patient and the strong one for everyone else when i just want everyone to be strong and patient for me for once in my life. 

i was already so tired of giving and giving and giving and giving everything i have and never receiving but i have nothing left to give anymore. he took everything from me with him when he went to jail that day and there‚Äôs nothing left of me now. its just emptiness. i have no patience or empathy or support in me to give to the people around me. i have no energy left to put on the fake mask of the perfect polite palatable trauma victim because even when i do i get dismissed, ignored and disrespected. but i have no other choice ig.

We were together a year, in which I poured myself into the relationship while I was being lied to, cheated on, verbally and physically abused. 

I‚Äôm just really struggling at the moment dealing with how unwanted and lonely I feel and while I know none of this was what I deserved, I feel guilty for staying so long. I really wished and hoped for him to change like he said he would so many times.

I poured myself into him and it‚Äôs like the more I loved him the worse he treated me.

I just want to hear from others how they got over their relationship and broke the emotional attachment because I‚Äôm really uncomfortable right now being alone and I feel extremely heart broken.
I feel like he broke a part of me and I want this feeling to end.

I would ask friends or family for advice but I have lied to them and hidden the abuse and I feel ashamed. 

Any advice or encouragement would help so much "

It makes me so sad and upset that he‚Äôs forgetting me and now I have no one. 


Repost 
I don‚Äôt know where to start. Lately, I feel disconnected from everything‚Äînumb, anxious, trapped in my own thoughts. I replay things over and over in my head, trying to make sense of them. I saw him again, and now I feel so stupid for going back.

For the first time in a long time, we spent the day together. At first, it felt familiar, almost comforting‚Äîlike nothing had changed. We laughed, joked, and fell into old habits. I miss the good parts of him. He‚Äôs funny, quick-witted, magnetic. But there‚Äôs always another side lurking underneath, waiting.

As the night went on, his demeanor shifted. He started making comments, grabbing at me, saying how long it had been since he‚Äôd had sex. I brushed it off, tried to change the subject. I just wanted to be with him without it turning into something else.

By 11 p.m., I told him I needed to leave‚ÄîI had driven three hours to see him, and I had a long drive home. But then he told me to take him 30 minutes away, to some random street. Said he had to use the bathroom. It didn‚Äôt make sense‚Äîthere were gas stations everywhere‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt question it. Maybe he just wanted to drive, listen to music.

When we got there, it was empty in a quiet neighborhood. He led me to the restroom, looked in the mirror, flexed, checked himself out. Then he grabbed my chest over my sweatshirt and said he wanted to see.

And in that moment, I knew.

I knew I had walked right back into something where I wasn‚Äôt respected. I felt ashamed‚Äînot just for being there, but for the part of me that still wanted his attention, even though I didn‚Äôt want to be touched by him.

I told him no. He laughed, said, Just do it. And I knew‚Äîif I kept refusing, he‚Äôd get annoyed, angry. So, like before, I gave in.

It escalated. He pulled his pants down while I kept saying, We‚Äôre not having sex. He said he knew‚Äîhe just wanted to ‚Äúnut.‚Äù He kept pushing me to take off my pants. I kept saying no. He kept pushing. And eventually, I gave in.

He sat on the toilet, made me stand in front of him for what felt like 30 minutes, biting me, slapping me every so often. I hated it. I kept thinking, How did I end up back here?

At one point, I tried to stop. I told him it was late, that this wasn‚Äôt why I came. I told him he lied‚Äîhe planned this. He just looked at me, knowing I wouldn‚Äôt leave. Then he pulled me closer, still exposed, still expecting me to keep going.

I felt trapped. If I refused, would he get angry? Would he turn on me?

Eventually, he finished. I just kept saying, What are we doing? This is so stupid. Can we go? I had a four-hour drive ahead of me, and none of this was what I wanted.

He acted surprised, like I was overreacting. Then he switched‚Äîhugging me, joking like nothing had happened.

He apologized, said he didn‚Äôt realize I‚Äôd be upset. Said he really cares about me. But it‚Äôs always the same‚Äîhe frames everything as ‚Äújust having fun,‚Äù but he never actually listens.

At one point, he put his hand on my neck in a sexual way‚Äîlaughing, acting like it was nothing.

But it‚Äôs not nothing.

I Keep Trying to Make Sense of It. But I Can‚Äôt.

A few months ago, I ended this relationship. And now I‚Äôm realizing‚ÄîI think it was abusive. But I feel so conflicted. I don‚Äôt want to ruin his life. He has nothing. No money. No stability. He clearly has mental health issues. But at the same time, I feel deeply wronged.

His family ignores what he does. When I try to talk about it, I feel gaslit‚Äînot just by him, but by them, too. It makes me feel crazy.

We were together for five years. There were good moments, but there were also times when I felt completely powerless. Things would feel fine for a while, and then something awful would happen. And then, it was like it never even happened. I started questioning my own memory.

But I know what happened.

These Are Some of the Things I Know Happened:
	One time, I was crying, and he slapped me in the face. The more I cried, the angrier he got.
	‚Ä¢	He pushed me into a towel rack during an argument. It dented. He was mad because I accidentally tossed his pants, and they hit his face.
	‚Ä¢	He tried to force me to drink shroom tea. When I refused, he shoved it toward me until it spilled, then slapped me hard, called me a ‚Äústupid bitch,‚Äù and blamed me.
	‚Ä¢	He stormed into my apartment once, furious that I left him at his brother‚Äôs house after drinking, even though I was trying to make sure he was safe. He threw my stuff everywhere, ripped my shirt in half off my body. My roommate had to kick him out.
	‚Ä¢	The first time he grabbed my neck, I was half-naked. Afterward, I had to get on a Zoom meeting, and my voice was scratchy. When I brought it up, he said I was exaggerating.
	‚Ä¢	In the mornings, he‚Äôd refuse to drive me to work unless we had sex. If I cried because I was tired or late, he‚Äôd call me names or threaten not to take me.
	‚Ä¢	During sex, if he couldn‚Äôt get aroused, he‚Äôd pinch me, pull my hair, call me degrading names. I‚Äôd cry, ask why he was mad. He‚Äôd blame me, call me a ‚Äúcheater‚Äù or a ‚Äúbitch.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	He climbed on top of me once and hit me in the head multiple times because I accidentally hit his eye with his pants while handing them to him.
	‚Ä¢	He drove erratically once, pulling my hair, saying we‚Äôd both die because I talked about leaving him. I had a panic attack while he was screaming.
	‚Ä¢	He choked me‚Äîmultiple times. Not for long, but long enough to terrify me.
	‚Ä¢	He wouldn‚Äôt let me go to the bathroom during sex. Wouldn‚Äôt let me stop even when I was crying. If he lost arousal, he‚Äôd pinch me, pull my hair, dig his nails into my skin.
	‚Ä¢	His cousin once overheard me crying naked during a fight and walked in to check. He got even angrier, blamed me for someone seeing me like that.

I hate admitting this, but I gave in to things a lot because I was afraid of what he‚Äôd do if I didn‚Äôt. When his brother was staying with us and sleeping in the same room, he‚Äôd make me have sex with him in the bathroom. It felt humiliating. But I didn‚Äôt know how to say no.

Early in our relationship, I think he did something sexual to me while I was half-asleep after getting high for the first time. I‚Äôve tried piecing it together, but it‚Äôs vague. Later, he started demanding sex even when I was crying. Sometimes, he wouldn‚Äôt pull out‚Äîjust to have control over me.

He made me feel like everything was my fault. He called me a slut, a bitch, accused me of cheating if I wanted to see friends or family. Meanwhile, he was the one cheating.

One time, neighbors called security because he was yelling, throwing me around, and I was crying. He screamed through the wall at them, calling them whores, saying he‚Äôd kill them. Afterward, he blamed me.

So Why Do I Still Feel Conflicted?

I know he has his own trauma. His own issues. A part of me still wants him to be okay. But I can‚Äôt shake how deeply wrong all of this feels.

I met my ex partner in April 2024 and we grew close very quickly. I thought he was the one. He saved me from my abusive family and him and his mother allowed me to move in with them after a horrible incident involving my cousin physically attacking both of us. My ex partner‚Äôs name is Heywood and he seemed very nice, until he showed his angry side. He was very sweet when he was in a good mood, but when angry he was a completely different person. He once drove his car recklessly while arguing with me and said if we crash it‚Äôs my fault, grabbed me by the neck multiple times, pushed me harshly to the point I flew across the hallway and blamed me for it, threatened to physically harm me and made himself look like he was going to do it just to scare and threaten me, grabbed me and held me, restricting my movement against my will, got beaten up by two guys in the middle of the night for putting his hands on me and blamed me for it happening and accused me of putting his life on the line because of it, threatened to take all my belongings from me and kick me out with absolutely nothing, and was verbally abusive and unsupportive, especially in times I was struggling with mental health and trauma. Told me to get over my trauma and the reason why I flew across the hallway in the first place was for opening up about it. He ended our relationship recently because I confronted him of continuing to follow someone on instagram who did something traumatic to me and I feel as if I was the problem. I have BPD and I understand having a borderline personality partner isn‚Äôt easy, I often got anxious and insecure in the relationship and would accuse him of not loving me and accused him of wanting to leave, but I was mostly very good to him. I did my best to be the best partner I could be, but I feel as if I was the problem because he ended the relationship this time. Am I the problem here?"

I'm ready to tell him to leave but I have no clue how to survive here. I couldn't get to a clinic or grocery store. I have no birth certificate or identification because he took it and destroyed it, and I keep trying to get them redelivered and they mysteriously never come.

Son born 2007
Married 2007
Daughter born 2011
Asked for divorce Sept 2020

I already left in fear because I knew who he was. However his duality, manipulation, and lies had me thinking we were splitting amicably. 

August 5th, 2021 while I was at work, he broke into my residence and waited for me to come home from my morning shift. He beat me with a baseball bat, had zip ties and duct tape, then stabbed me in the chest with a fixed blade hunting knife. Proceeding to hold me at gunpoint. 

I talked him out of killing me by telling him a story to tell police and that we would get back together. 

I was airlifted to a hospital 2 hours away. Knife barely missed my heart and lung.

He left a note, cash, kids birth certificates etc. at his place, evident he intended murder/suicide. 

I am stuck in a loop of doom. He is in prison until we 2029 and will be 56 years old. I am convinced he will ""come for me"". But that's so far from now!

I have no mother, and I cannot talk to my father about this because he ""took the exes side"" the whole year after I filed for divorce and moved out. Didn't get to go to Thanksgiving or Christmas with my DAD for the first time in my then 40 years because of his manipulative abilities. 

My current husband was my boyfriend at the time, and the first time he met my father and my son was at the hospital the day I almost died. 

I just feel like ""my people"" are tired of me being so.... stuck. My house is generally ""not clean""... I barely cook.... like WHEN will I get out of this loop? But they also don't want to hear about it anymore and I thought maybe unloading on willing strangers might help.

When anything happens in his games or with his friends, I'm always the one that has to deal with his yelling, cursing, throwing, slamming, and stomping. 

This ended up escalating when I couldn't pick him up from work one day since I was so nauseous I couldn't get out of bed. He came home angry, and when I asked him what's wrong he yelled, ""I can't feel my fucking fingers which is why I don't like to fucking walk!"" And threw his phone in my direction. Luckily, it missed my head by a few inches. (Also, for context there's a bus system he took before walking ten minutes to our home)


I've been slowly moving in to a new apartment, and it feels so freeing. I hope to be fully out in a few weeks when my coworker helps me get some of my bigger stuff and my pets. 

I feel like I should be feeling guilty right now like I have every time I upset him for years, but I just find myself feeling excited. I'll be leaving a note the day I leave telling him exactly why I left and to never contact me again (and I'll be changing my number).

I just can't wait for a peaceful new chapter. I'm sure I'll feel guilty and mourn when I'm finally out, though. "

I have been scrimping, saving, working extra to send my son (5) to the private school he wants to attend. His father works for the public school system and I am also terrified of him abducting my son if I send him there because he's threatened to before. 

So this entire year, I've been worrying about how he's going to adjust. I've been worrying about things like him only having one parent (there is a no contact order that covers the kids), us not having the wealth other students there have, etc. 

I learned yesterday that he finished this year first in his class (75) academically and obtained the only perfect score on his Kindergarten readiness exam. 

I wanted to share because 1) sometimes it can feel like good news is few and far between in this chapter of life, and 2)  if you're like me when I was making the decision to leave, you are worried about whether the children will adjust okay. I'm here, on the other side of leaving, letting you know that your children will **thrive** in a home free of abuse."

I stayed with him for a while because he said he would change, but after a conversation with a friend I decided it couldn‚Äôt go on. 

She suggested that I just block him and possibly get a restraining order, but I still saw the good in him and didn‚Äôt feel right saying nothing, so I sent him a message explaining where I was coming from and telling him how much I loved him. I also grew close to his mom and she was abused by his father, so I sent her a message explaining things too. 

But I got so scared of leaving and worried for his safety I reached back out. He said he was upset, but that we could work it out. Then a few days later, he started berating me. He told me I was vile, vicious, cruel, that I shot him down like a dog, that he tried to kill himself and that it was my fault, that I‚Äôm horrible for not being patient with his progress. This went on for days. His mom also sided with him and hated me. He told me if I wanted things to work again I would have to put my all into being the perfect partner (or ‚Äòwife‚Äô as he worded it) and always put him and his mom first, even above myself.

I‚Äôve been trying to do what he said, always cooking for him, cleaning for him, almost completely taking over taking care of the dog, trying my best to sit patiently during his angry moments. My only solace would be an hour a day where I would go to the park to engage in my own joyful movement. I was exhausted from all this. But a few days ago he sat me down and told me that I wasn‚Äôt doing enough, that my time at the park was taking away from me doing things he enjoys, that he was dissatisfied and still angry and traumatized over me trying to leave. He said that he‚Äôs been doing too good to deserve this, that I could never find someone as good as him. This went on until 1am, he wouldn‚Äôt let me go to sleep until he was done. He started again the next morning, it got to the point I was curled up on the floor sobbing. Our poor dog was shaking and peed from fright, my bf just called him a ‚Äúpussy‚Äù. 

After all this, he started acting all sweet again and apologized for ‚Äòacting like a jerk‚Äô. Things are calm now, he‚Äôs acting sweet and loving again, but after the event I called a DV hotline and they are going to set me up with a legal advocate. But now I feel awful and scared to leave again. Is he right that I‚Äôm not being patient enough with his progress? He has grown in some ways that I‚Äôm proud of him for. But all this torment feels like punishment for me trying to leave, and I‚Äôm worried about our dog, even though our dog is very attached to my bf and my bf says he loves him. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy most of the time. Why does it feel so hard to leave? I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll miss the good.

He wants me completely moved into his apartment by the end of this month, and even wants to get married soon. We‚Äôve only been together for 6 months. I want to leave before all this happens, but I fear that I‚Äôm being unfair."

I‚Äôm just so empty without him in my life for some reason.. Why is that? He constantly used to beat on me, he sent me to the emergency room a handful of times, he would always berate and degrade me.. telling me if I killed myself then everyone‚Äôs life would be so much better. Why. I spent 3 years of my life dedicated to him and our future.. I tried so hard to make him a better person because I felt awful knowing that our mutual friends hated the way he is.

I get so upset knowing that he‚Äôs out there with other women, either taking them on dates, sleeping with them in the same bed we used to hug each other in, or both. Why do I get like that? It‚Äôs like he forgot about me and all our moments together, all our plans we had for the future. I just hope these women don‚Äôt pet our cats.. Especially my little Jolyne. 

I‚Äôve been isolated from everyone. He won‚Äôt admit what he did wrong, he will never give me closure. I just want him to acknowledge the physical abuse he put me through on a near daily basis ‚Äî but I‚Äôm not sure if that will make me feel any better. He took everything I worked hard for, and now I‚Äôm homeless with nowhere to go. Maybe if I had kept my mouth shut then things wouldn‚Äôt be so bad.

I had a dream about him last night; we were in our home, on our bed. We shared the sweetest kiss, the ones I remember from the good times we shared together, and he held me in his arms. He told me he loved me, and then he stroked my hair. It felt so nice hearing his voice telling me sweet things. In that moment I felt loved.

Why do I miss him? When will my love for him go away? Is this normal?"

These were my encounters that are signs of DV 

Emotional: 
- Cussing at me (using foul language in arguments) 
- Calling me horrible names (b*tch, c*nt, stupid, etc)
- Disregarding my feelings to make his feelings seem bigger 
- Telling me I shouldn‚Äôt wear more ‚Äúrevealing‚Äù clothes because I‚Äôd be seeking men‚Äôs attention
- Constantly asking ‚Äúwho I‚Äôm trying to look good for‚Äù anytime I‚Äôd put a little more makeup on than usual, or do my hair 
- Saying or doing awful things to me behind closed doors, but making me feel guilty and like I‚Äôm the bad guy if anyone found out about some of the things he said or did 

Physical:
- Isolating me from my friends by saying he doesn‚Äôt like them and trying to make them seem awful (and I‚Äôm not seeing it because they‚Äôre my friends) 
- Using scare tactics during arguments: furrowing brows, showing teeth, clenching jaw
- Yelling during arguments
- Escalation from slamming his hands down during arguments, to throwing items, to throwing items at me, to grabbing me, to throwing me onto bed and pinning me down 
- Also slapping me on occasion (but never the face) 
- Driving erratically with me in the car 

There are a lot of other things he‚Äôd say or do, smaller in detail, that I won‚Äôt list here. But if anyone has questions on if what they‚Äôre experiencing is DV, please reach out. I wish I found a post like this when I was experiencing it, because at the time I couldn‚Äôt decipher if what I was experiencing was normal or abusive. Overall he was a very aggressive, narcissistic, and controlling man that could hide it well with the lovey dovey that he showed me 75% of the time. "

And then. Of course the shame associated with bankruptcy. 

I had to do so many things so quickly just to survive, to keep my kids and I safe, and I feel like I can‚Äôt retain information. I‚Äôm trying so hard. I‚Äôm writing things down.

I‚Äôm in agreement with them, I have no idea why I stayed. This last year has been particularly difficult, and I‚Äôve honestly felt like a passenger in my own life. My honest reason for staying is that I was trying to help my wife, as she was a victim of her mum‚Äôs abuse as a child. I felt if I said anything, I‚Äôd be the one who left the family home, and I didn‚Äôt want my kids to stay with her. Too many stories about men not being believed.

It got tense I got scared I asked him to leave he wouldn‚Äôt we talked a little more he did stay calm but he was just acting like I was acting insane bc I was keeping my distance bc I was scared then I asked him to leave again still wouldn‚Äôt leave so I grabbed my phone my pepper spray and ran outside and asked why he wouldn‚Äôt respect me asking him to leave and he continued to sit on the couch and ask me to come back inside I said I had 911 ready to be called please leave this went on for like 5-10 mins before he eventually started leaving and saying if he left now he‚Äôd never talk to me again how I have no reason to be acting like this. Like I didn‚Äôt feel safe the night he strangled me he wouldn‚Äôt let me leave his house and this night he wouldn‚Äôt leave my house that was so triggering and he just acted like I don‚Äôt have trauma for what he did. And like really what would have happened if I went back in that house? What was his plan? Bc I was hysterical no meaningful conversation could be had at that point. Why couldn‚Äôt he just leave the first time I asked? This has to be my breaking point I can‚Äôt live like this. "

I have left many times but always come back because I don't have money. I would like to get a job but I have to care for my 4 year old son. He is too young for full day kindergarten. I've looked no other free programs long enough to help. 

I am in a catch 22 because I need money to put him in daycare, but I need him in daycare before I can start working. I need money for gas but I need a car to get to work to make money. 

My husband enjoys keeping me trapped like this. Everytime I leave he cuts off my phone plan and car insurance to punish me. Since I need to live out of my car because there aren't shelters in my area, without gas money I can't sustain. 

I am waiting so patiently for my son to grow up so I can work but it's not coming soon enough. 

I take pictures everytime my husband leaves a mark on me. But my children witness everything and they have started mirroring our behavior and it makes me so sad. I need to get out. 

My family and his family have turned a blind eye. They tell me that I deserve it because I'm standing up for myself which is bad and I need to be a good submissive girl to my husband. If he beats me it's because I am not obeying him.

I have reached out to hundreds of people - lawyers, police, social workers, churches, friends, family, random strangers, the domestic hotline, been in domestic abuse shelters. But it all ends up in the same place. They tell me *I* have to leave. He won't change but *I* have to leave. Since his marks on me aren't bad enough to put him in jail for longer than a night, calling the police only makes things worse. I did that once and it made things worse. Unfortunately I just have to keep documenting and build a bigger case, or wait for him to beat me badly for police to lock him up for a long time, or wait for my son to grow up so I can get a job. 

My husband tells me once I get a job he will work less and make me pay for rent. But I will have to figure out how to not give him what he wants and just leave once I get enough money. I just have to prepare for that. 

I'm not looking for advice so much as just prayers I guess and validation. As I said I've talked to hundreds of people and they all said they can't help me, I have to help myself. "

This includes gossiping, spreading lies, making the person seem unstable, arguing in bad faith, and generally being disagreeable toward them. The language they use is subtly demeaning and designed to make the victim seem inferior, untrustworthy, unwell, or even malicious. They‚Äôve even admitted that they only treat this one person this way and no one else. It mostly happens when others are not around and in targeted messages.  Does their overall kindness to others outweigh their targeted cruelty?  What if the target confides situations that they have been offended by but your interaction with the offender is pleasant?

He acts as though nothing has ever happened to him, even as my stepmom continues to treat him terribly. It really troubles me that he can't even remember what my mom supposedly did to his arm.

Ended a long-term relationship with someone who I really loved deeply, but unfortunately had not managed to work out his mental health/emotional abuse issues throughout our 4-year relationship. We were engaged but I postponed the engagement and then broke things off because he wouldn‚Äôt stop his behaviors, try hard enough to change, or seek therapy, no matter how many times I begged him to.

He never hit me or physically abused me but he had a huge anger problem (he has trauma and impulse control issues and grew up with abusive parents) and would yell at me, call me horrific names (swear words, insults, name-calling), dump me, threaten to leave me or end the relationships dozens of times, give me the silent treatment, throw things around the house, kick stuff, punch/slam his fists, break random things, etc. It was really stressful and caused me immense anguish and I asked him so many times to treat me better, he would apologize and be better for awhile until doing it again after a few weeks or months.

I eventually reached my breaking point when his last episode (involving him acting aggressive and screaming/throwing things around the house, but not at me) caused me a nervous breakdown. I was in a fight or fight mode and basically couldn‚Äôt function for weeks.

We broke up, but he‚Äôs recently been making a big effort to work on his mental health and says he will do anything to change and better himself as a human. He says he recognized the error in his ways, the abuse cycle, how he abused me, and is finally actually doing the things I asked him to do all those years. He is meditating every day, going to therapy, and his overall mood and demeanor seems to be very different. He says that me standing up to him and not taking his BS anymore has given him a massive wake-up call about how destructive his behaviors and mental health have been to him and to everyone around him. He says he wants to change and be a better version of him, not just for me, but for himself. He seems generally less reactive, angry, and explosive. I really love the calm, sweet side of him - the kind, caring side that‚Äôs not so tormented by his own trauma and rage. I miss this side, it‚Äôs who I fell in love with.

So we are in a limbo state. We broke up, but we are talking, so not exactly together but not fully apart either. I‚Äôm considering giving him another chance in a few months or so if I am convinced that he‚Äôs actually taking the right steps. I miss and love him dearly but I am still very unsure. We have talked about how I‚Äôm unsure, and how neither of us are in a place to go on dates with or sleeping with other people right now.

The thing is, over the past couple of months, about 3-4 men have hit on me/seemed to possibly express some level of interest in me (which hasn‚Äôt happened in years; I swear somehow men can sense if you‚Äôre not in a committed relationship!). One was an old friend from high school who ran into me, another was at a pizza place, and a coffee shop. I told my high school friend (we chatted for a bit and I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was flirting with me) that I‚Äôm open to friendship but not emotionally available to date (because of my complicated relationship situation). 

When a random guy around my age struck up a conversation with me at the coffee shop, I was friendly and chatted. I was not flirtatious, just nice and friendly as I would be to anyone talking to me, and had no idea if it was inappropriate of me to be talking with him. We didn‚Äôt talk about dating or anything inappropriate, just talked about the area, how there aren‚Äôt many people our age here (most people are much older than me and it can get lonely!), jobs, etc. I enjoyed talking with him but also felt so guilty about it. Was I leading him on? Being disloyal to my ex, who I have a complicated relationship with? I didn‚Äôt tell him about my complicated relationship status because it didn‚Äôt come up and it would have felt very awkward to mention it. He asked for my number to stay in touch and since we were having a friendly chat I gave it to him, as I have to other friends I‚Äôve met (I recently connected with a couple of women and gave them my number too). 

I can‚Äôt help but feel like I did something wrong and I feel so confused and icky about all of this. If the coffee shop guy asks me out on a date I‚Äôll just tell him that he seems like a genuinely cool person and I appreciate connecting as friends but I‚Äôm ending a complicated long-term relationship and not emotionally available to date right now. Was it wrong for me to talk with him? Should I have ignored him when he was friendly and approached me to say hi? Told him immediately that I have a boyfriend/partner (even tho I don‚Äôt)? Should I have refused to give him my number when he asked (I was conflicted but didn‚Äôt want to be rude to someone who was friendly)? All the work I do is virtual and I often feel so isolated and lonely these days, it‚Äôs nice having people be friendly to me. I would have also been thrilled if a woman my age approached me and gave me her number to stay in touch as friends.

1jaqsg0,"Feeling Ashamed, Struggling to let go of abuser",SnailBonnie,7,2025-03-14 00:05:09+00:00,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jaqsg0/feeling_ashamed_struggling_to_let_go_of_abuser/,"I've read some of the stories here of victims of abuse. I've been reading about the cycle of abuse, and I too watched my mum get abused.

I am with an abuser, but its my own fault. He doesn't really beg me to stay, he doesn't hold me captive. We don't have children together and we don't even live together. So why do I find it so hard to let go?

Last time we were together two weeks ago I was trying to play a game. He dropped his toast on the bed I was sitting on and I asked if he could clean it. He asked me to get up and I said I dont need to get up, he can just get a dustpan to clean it. He ended up throwing his toast at me. I told him he was acting childish and he ended up pouring an entire drink over my head. I locked myself in the bathroom after that until he left.

  
We've barely spoken since. This isn't the first time he has done something like this. But this time is different. Yes, I say this to myself every time. The abuse always changes. But this time, he didn't even say sorry. When we have spoken, he justifies his behaviour. He said I shouldn't have called him names. He said he would do it again. I was disgusted when he said this. To go back would be me saying ""I give you permission to abuse me.""

Yet I know, when I will be lonely, which happens often as I don't have any friends, I will think of him. I will idolise the good parts in our relationship, which is literally just him accepting me for who I am - Someone who's done mostly nothing with their life.

How do I stop? Has anyone else felt this way? Am I the only person who cant let go of being repeatedly abused just because of 1 good day in a month? What is wrong with me?"

I was doing pretty good, spending time with friends, going out more and taking back my control. However this week it's been...rough.

Sure, I occasionally had flashbacks and heard him call me stupid, all the favorite curse words (b***h, c**t, w***e, etc), all the verbal abuse and assaults and it didn't bug me as much. But this week has been rough with it amping up to the point where my nightmares came back and having panic attacks at work just being near the men. It's just been so bad and like...I knew it'd happen, but I didn't expect it to get this bad after 6 months of leaving. 

My question is, does it get better? With handling the flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety of being found? What does healing look like? I'm in therapy, there's a safety plan enforced at my job who's aware of the situation, I'm with friends and enjoying my hobbies again and relying on my support group but...I don't even know what HEALED looks like, or at least healing progress. Will it ever get better? I don't miss him, nor do I ever want to go back especially since my life would be at risk, but I just want to know if it'll get better and what does ""better"" even look like with everything that has happened? 

This ended up being a vent, and I apologize. "

He's been emotionally and verbally abusive to me the whole relationship. He's in active addiction.

Our relationship has been on and off for about a year and a half. We met August 2023, moved in together in November 2023, lived together until March 2024, when I moved back to my parents house because the abuse was too much. I was hospitalized for SI in December, 2023 and tried to kms in February 2024. 

He moved to be closer to me (my parents were in a different state then where we lived). It had always just been emotional and verbal abuse but now he was getting more aggressive. Once he lunged across the bed at me because I was trying to leave. Another time he wanted me to leave and I was waiting for my mom in the living room and he pushed me and then picked me up and dragged me outside, slammed the door in my face and then came out the side door to continue yelling at me. 

I've been trying to break up with him for a long time but I always miss him.

This time was different because I actually reported him to the police after he sent nudes of me to people and said he was going to kill me if I didn't answer his call. (I was really trying to move on and he didn't like that)

But I still miss him. I want someone to hold me and to love me, and when he wasn't abusive he made me feel so loved and not alone. 

I feel guilty that I'm ruining his life by pressing charges against him and I'm overreacting to the situation because he didn't actually hurt me he just said he would. 

I also feel like I can't say I'm a domestic violence victim because he didn't actually hurt me.

Disclaimer: I am writing about a situation of my relative because her reddit is being actively monitored by her abuser. I will be able to call her to share comments. 

I do not know all the details and their history of the abuse, I only know that ‚Äúit was not that bad before‚Äù and that it has rapidly escalated about a month ago - that‚Äôs when she reached out to me for help. He hit and strangled her several times, there are photos of bruises on her neck and recordings of conversation that lead to one of the attacks.

She is ready to leave this weekend while he is at work. She has most basics packed, some cash stashed, and a temporary housing arranged in a different city. She, however, feels uneasy about leaving unannounced. She wants to somehow let him know that she left. She is convinced that it isn‚Äôt a big deal because the abuser is only physically violent when he is drunk. She says she only expects him to be verbally aggressive.

I think it is a bad idea because what if her farewell causes things to escalate even more? He is a very strong man and she is a physically sick weak woman. There is absolutely no way she can fight back if he attacks her again. I believe she is not dead only because he let her live.

I need some tips/advice please."
1jada2f,I got blamed for his abuse,UsagiiA,36,2025-03-13 14:29:54+00:00,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jada2f/i_got_blamed_for_his_abuse/,"Hi,

So, I came on here to talk about being in the ER, and leaving my son‚Äôs dad‚Ä¶ My abuser.

I spoke with a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who ended up blaming me :( she said ‚Äúwhy do you keep allowing him the space to hit you?‚Äù :/ then she told me to ‚Äúmace him‚Äù and I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs illegal‚Äù (the state we live in isn‚Äôt a stand your ground state) and she says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù then, one thing that gets to me is the, ‚Äúif it were me‚Ä¶‚Äù because if it were YOU (or her) she would act however she‚Äôll act but I‚Äôm not her and she isn‚Äôt me. Our lifestyles are different too. I‚Äôm a full time stay at home mom and I rely on my abuser‚Äôs income. She‚Äôs a mom too but she works‚Äî she‚Äôs a flight attendant so she gets to travel too. When she was a stay at home mom, she was a lot more compassionate, but now she‚Äôs back to who she was before, and she feels good about herself. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ a mom‚Ä¶ trying to survive. It makes me not want to talk about it. I don‚Äôt have the income to leave in a flash but I have a plan! And my plan is in motion, just because people don‚Äôt see it at lighting speed doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not happening BUT I HATE THAT TOO!!!! That I feel like I have to explain myself :/ but no one asks him to explain why he‚Äôs abusive. I felt good prior to speaking with her, like, I was ready to talk about it but now I just don‚Äôt want to talk to people I know. I feel safer with y‚Äôall, strangers on the internet, than friends. I have no tangible community."

I just want to share solitude and love to everyone that‚Äôs either healing after leaving, contemplating how to escape, and those that are unfortunately just experiencing the horrific behavior of our abusers. You matter, this is not your fault, and you absolutely are worthy of safety. Abuse can make us feel less than, because an abusive person‚Äôs low self-esteem encourages them to hurt us. Even though it may be difficult, I want you to know for a solid fact, you DO deserve more and you‚Äôre sooooo special. You light up the room when you walk in, you make someone happy that you‚Äôre alive, and there are people wishing for a you. 

What I‚Äôve come to understand is that these abusers really hate themselves and their lives, so they try to reconcile that by being horrible to others. They believe this false sense of superiority and it‚Äôs just making them worse off. Even if you‚Äôre standing up for yourself, that‚Äôs still not a reason for you to be abused. I don‚Äôt care what they try to tell you. I still battle with the guilt of leaving people I really loved, but I‚Äôd rather be safe and offered genuine love than fearing the next form of abuse. I‚Äôm not saying you won‚Äôt be scared after escaping, but at least you have the certainty of yourself and no one attacking you every chance they get. These people are not on the same emotional and mental level as us, whereas we try to do good in the world and work on ourselves.

I used to cry because the person I loved so deeply kept actively choosing to tear me down and abuse me, despite me begging, presenting healthy connection tactics, praying, offering them spiritual advice, and reasoning with ‚Äúa potential justified cause‚Äù of this behavior. Multiple times and it unfortunately had been happening this way my entire life. I urge you to find good community and expose yourself to a healthy relationship. You‚Äôll see so quickly the red flags that they‚Äôd manipulated to look like slight yellows and light greens in the beginning or throughout the relationship.

I get hesitant to write about the very real experience, because I get watched online. That‚Äôs the worst part about it. I will never understand how someone could choose to hurt you, so you feel unwanted. But when you leave and seek support they even know you deserve, they either watch you or have people do it for them. Blasphemous. It just speaks to the fact that you do not deserve this. Over the past 4-5 years, my abusers have stalked me and continually harassed me with post-relational abuse, even though I let them be and chose to heal in private. You don‚Äôt have to. You can be as loud about your pain as you need, because you suffer in silence. You deserve to heal. You deserve to smile. You deserve true love.

I watched a video this morning of a girl about to marry a man that wasn‚Äôt even sure of her and now, she‚Äôs marrying a very good man, who believes her to be his best friend and the true love of his life. The reality is, unlike what some of us have heard similarly but were never treated right, this man was all about his talk. So, I say this to say that your love is waiting for you in SO many forms, please know it‚Äôs possible for each of us. TRUE Love finds you in the ways that you need the most throughout life, and it‚Äôll never make you feel confused. Not about yourself of anything else. It‚Äôll be the most certain and safest experience you‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôm wishing the best for you all. 

If you ever need emotional support or affirmations, please contact me! Xo"
1jablxw,He has a drinking problem and is kicking me out,NoPractice111,3,2025-03-13 13:11:19+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jablxw/he_has_a_drinking_problem_and_is_kicking_me_out/,"Hi friends, not sure if this is the right subreddit but I‚Äôm grasping at straws here. 
A little backstory:
My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months. We met off Tinder, but went to the same high school and have many mutual friends. After our first date, he was constantly trying to go on more dates with me and I was enamored; the connection was there. We began dating shortly after and he moved into a new house that needed some help fixing up. I helped him fix the house, and at that point I was spending so much time there that he was begging me to move in with him. Everything was great so far, so I figured why not. Through the months I met his whole family and I loved them, they accepted me as one of their own. We talked about marriage, having kids, how we‚Äôre both ready to settle down and have a family. 

We eventually moved into a new house (renting) and that‚Äôs when things started to take a turn. He started drinking, and he‚Äôs not the kind of person who can handle it. He doesn‚Äôt know when to stop. He will drink until he is belligerent and a completely different person. Usually when he gets that drunk, he will start an argument with me and try to pack up his things so he can leave. I never let him drive like that, so he‚Äôs never actually left. Every day after a fight like that‚Äôll, we always talk about how he has a problem with drinking and he‚Äôs going to stop. The usual. At first the fights were a month or two apart. And then it was every two weeks. This week it‚Äôs already happened twice. 

Last night after he lied to get me out of the house, he made me sit at a bar with him and his friend while he got drunk, and refused to let me drive his car. He then drove to drop his friend off, and then sat in his driveway with him for 3 hours drinking close to 18 beers while I sat there and twiddled my thumbs. My phone was dead at this point and I couldn‚Äôt do anything. Then he tries to leave. He can barely walk, can‚Äôt speak a coherent sentence, and wants to drive. At this point I‚Äôm crying, begging him to let me drive because I am stone cold sober. My best friend died from being in the car with a drunk driver and I am extremely uneasy about the situation. He refuses, rips out of the driveway, and takes down his friend‚Äôs mailbox. He severely damages the side of his car, gets a flat, and knocks off his side mirror in one go. He has to pull over and tells me to get a ride. My phone is dead, he will not let me use his. It is 1am. He starts calling me toxic for trying to control his drinking, and breaks up with me. 

I sit here now in our shared house and I am unsure what to do. I have no money to my name. He hasn‚Äôt let me have our (private) landlord‚Äôs number this whole time, and is saying he‚Äôs calling her to tell her I need to leave. All of my things are here and I have nowhere to go. I have also paid 40% of the rent this month which is good for 24 more days. Can he legally kick me out with no warning period..? Not that I want to stay, but I do need somewhere to rest my head while I figure out my next steps. I really am just at a loss. I got a concussion a few days ago (unrelated) and that, mixed with the emotions of what is going on is rendering me unable to think. 

TLDR; (now ex) boyfriend is trying to kick me out of a house that I have paid 40% of rent for, effective immediately."

I keep having nightmares about what happened and almost in a weird way survivors guilt. "

Well the last couple instances i find myself wishing i could have someone that makes me feel safe. Wishing i could experience a normal relationship before i die. Thinking about what i have to offer outside of the pain i carry etc. is this unhealthy? I have kids and haven‚Äôt even left yet and no job or family to go to. Why the change in my thoughts?

I don‚Äôt really know if my feelings are valid or if i really am being controlling and crazy. I‚Äôm very confused. 

We moved to a new place to disconnect from the city and the corporate world after he had a mental breakdown (justifiable) *insert terrible act of injustice that he suffered*Husband said he‚Äôs not gonna make any friends or be his very outgoing bubbly self. We argued about this as i thought it incredibly unrealistic and he tends to have these dramatic introspective (but not actually solving the real problem) episodes. Anyways He‚Äôs a smart,funny, humble relatable guy and people flock to him when he shows this side. We went through a very rough patch where he determined he was gonna spend a lot of time rebuilding broken pieces of our relationship and emphasized spending all our time together. He would say that if he could find a place cheap enough he‚Äôd not go back to work and we would just spend time together. It was a hard time for me. I do enjoy spending all my time with him but he was having frequent episodes of anger and distress about large scale/macro things like economics or religion, government corruption etc. all things i can‚Äôt solve but have to listen to and not piss him off with an opinion he doesn‚Äôt like. Fast forward we are here and he‚Äôs very outgoing making friends with everyone and constantly cracking jokes and making everyone smile. He‚Äôs fast tracking his way into every friendship that comes up. He drops our religion of 4 years and the friends we made with it. He did have valid reasons for the friendships and valid issues with the religion that can‚Äôt be ignored but he did it abruptly and we have kids. There was no drinking, no smoking, no cursing,  now he does all three simultaneously. He says people change and went from us being a team and me being ‚Äúthe most important thing in his life‚Äù to me being a bitch thst doesn‚Äôt allow him to grow  as a person. People change over time. I‚Äôd bring up that not everyone is a good look for a friend. People that are drinking alot and using vulgar language a lot aren‚Äôt the people we want to attach to at this stage in our lives with young kids and goals to be better and do better. But when i try to talk about this he says I‚Äôm crazy. I feel like he switches up too often and i have nothing that i can count on as a stable trait of his. I feel very insecure in the instability. I‚Äôll try to express it, he will deny deny deny and the. He will eventually say something mean and off topic. Or even bring up a reason why I‚Äôm stupid in comparison to him and then it just all goes to shit and I‚Äôm calling him vindictive and abusive. And he‚Äôs telling me that the thing that angers him most and that I‚Äôm basically asking for it when i call him those names. He has a rule that i can‚Äôt track his character or he will lose it. What a mess.

1ja0anb,My 4 year relationship with my BPD ex fianc√©.,Cam9101,2,2025-03-13 01:12:23+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ja0anb/my_4_year_relationship_with_my_bpd_ex_fianc√©/,"I have recently left a 4 year relationship. A very very bad, abusive in the final year, relationship that ended with me with my father and her with the friends she constantly complained to me about.

When we separated it was after she dumped filthy cat litter on my head that I had to clean from my hair for 2 days. She would often throw glass and ceramic, pans, etc but glass was always broken when she snapped. 

She has BPD in the 2nd degree and has been cheated on before which is why I always tried to be open and honest with her. It got to the point in year 2 we just couldn't make things work and we took time from each other. Foolishly I allowed myself to have sex with two women in two days because I was scared and destroyed mentally. My last relationship ended similar to how it was going and I spiraled, which I did voice to her but it's no excuse for my actions in weakness. After that I promised I'd tell her when we got back together. 

This unfortunately came at a bad time because she would eventually ask me if I had done anything while we were apart. Yes I had but at the time I know she couldn't handle if I just came out and said it; so I lied. To this day its the only lie I've ever told her but she would eventually go through my phone with the passcode I gave her because I didn't mind her going through my phone and she discovers the messages from 1 of the women and she proceeds to toss my ps5 and throw me out of her place, I was staying at college during this time. I wanted to leave and keep the 2nd secret but I'm not a liar so I told her about the second. I embarrassingly banged on her door to no avail for 30 minutes , she would take me back like 2 weeks later.

Yet people with BPD have a hard time coping with betrayal especially from those who they live dearly. 

From that point on she saw me as not ""black"" or ""white"" but a grey area ""what will I do next"". ((I allowed her to have my passcode and passwords after this.)) Our relationship deteriorated slowly for the next two years she'd call me a b word often, blame-shift, accuse, deny feeling uncomfortable or down, accuse me of babying her by acknowledging her illness when she would demean herself, and in the last year hit me, hate me, deny me sex, deny me her presence, run to her friends she claimed to be upset with all the time and even doing petty things like unplugging the wifi box and throwing water on me. What scared me the most and when I knew it was over was when she threatened to break my glasses, I'm virtually blind without them. I also have had the cops called on me 3 times in her rages when I held her down to not cut herself on glass I ALWAYS HAD TO CLEAN.

I hated her friends after a while because they were like her and I tried to understand why they disliked me so much but it's because she never after going off to them about me, went back and fixed the wrong things she said. She accused me of sabotaging her car after we split even though she scratched mine and also broke 2 of my TVs

I hate that her life will be easy because I know it will. She doesn't feel my pain; last message I sent her was about a month ago, a final goodbye and she just called me weird and I apologized. I still think of her often her voice, the gap of her teeth, her sad face, her joy eating my food. I wish I could forget her moans, we were so in tune or so I thought and now someone else will have her. She's pretty, has a fat ass, dresses decently and is bisexual(that's a little joke). No but seriously she's with her friends now and I'm sure they're out there blaming me and having the world fall at their feet.

I hate all of her friends but one the most and I'll say his name Max. He's a trans man who we both(me and my ex fianc√©)wanted to at a certain point have a threesome with okay cool cool. We ended up falling out multiple time because my ex fianc√© would come home and complain to me about him and I had enough but you can't ever make someone drop their friends; this friend was bad for them, still I let it go. We tried to make up and we're in his words ""associates"" at the time he asked me this question no bs ""do you want to watch my partner and my ex fianc√© naked cooking for us on valentines. I was like that's cool and all and we continued to talk more and he eventually said we aren't friends and I was like but you legit just asked to see my partner naked in a kitchen gown? 

My ex fianc√© would never take my side against her friends I even went off on two of them like 3 times before I called it quits trying to help that way.

so she would eventually conceal problems she had with her friends. This would make her feel as if well ""if I don't want to talk to him about something I don't have to"" I SHOULD'VE LEFT THEN. Communication became shoddy and eventually we wouldn't even interact anymore for weeks and even texting became mundane and she'd block me on social media and not post me or follow me often. It became embarrassing to post the pictures over and over. 

A month before we separated I sexted a girl one night on Snapchat and in my soul I knew I knew she was coming to check my phone because I had changed the passcode on my phone earlier in the day so she could see me struggle to put my passcode in. I hate that we separated but I just couldn't take being ignored anymore I deserved better so I left my phone on the charger woke up to her accusing me of cheating the entire time, keep in mind she hadn't come into my room to see me for about a month and a half towards the end of our last year together. I just didn't care anymore. I didn't consider us together at that point she would block me and go to her friends often our last kiss was in a Wendy's parking lot where I ""struggled"" with my passcode.

If any partner refuses to communicate LEAVE, you don't know what you don't know.

I'm happy it ended but I hate being without her no one will take the time I did with her. I was 19 when we began I am 23 now. We lived together in our own place for 2 years and had 2 cats that she took in the end she now lives with her friend and I'm ruined. "

No family no close friends. A ridiculous amount of context here, but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs important anymore.

My husband has severe mental health struggles, and it‚Äôs taken a huge toll on our marriage. The breaking point for him was losing a brutal custody battle for his child. The forensic psychiatrist and guardian ad litem both recommended we get custody, but the judge ruled against us, leaving his daughter with her mother. He had documented abuse from his ex and even had her father testify against her, but nothing changed.

After that, he completely unraveled‚Äîshaving his head in a rage, quitting his job, blowing all our money, and putting us into debt until we had to sell our home. His ex-wife was a constant source of stress and conflict, and even after winning, she continued making life difficult.

The Abuse and Escalation

During this time, he became emotionally and verbally abusive‚Äîchasing me around the house, screaming in my face, demanding that I hit him, and then cycling through apologies before doing it all over again. His best friend even stayed with us and told me I should leave but didn‚Äôt want to say too much because they‚Äôre childhood friends.

This isn‚Äôt new behavior. Early in our relationship, I hit him first during an argument while drunk. Police were there for the music being loud and he told me to go into one of the rooms. I said no, he grabbed my arm and i punched him in the face. To stop me he punched me several times, and I briefly lost consciousness. I carried guilt for this and still believe I was at fault. You shouldn‚Äôt hit anyone unless you have to, right? And i despise women who hit men because they know that they can‚Äôt hit them back. I‚Äôm very remorseful and ashamed about it. A year Later, we had a heated argument over something trivial (whether robots can have emotions), and when I tried to walk away, he grabbed me by the neck, threw me on the bed, and choked me.

For years, he told me I was the reason he screamed and that I needed to ‚Äúlearn to shut up.‚Äù He said if I attacked his character (calling him crazy, pointing out overreactions, saying he was a bad friend or a bad person), he would react aggressively. I internalized this and tried to be careful, but no matter what I did, if he was in the mood to rage, he would. He once dragged me across the floor, crouched over me, screaming in my face‚Äîdespite me following every rule he set for how I should respond to his outbursts. I brought this to his attention several times and no explanation. He gave me all these things i better not do because it‚Äôll provoke him and nothing worked? 



In December of last year We moved to a farm for a fresh start, selling our house and getting an RV. I handled the financial mess he created, even had to sue a contractor who ran off with our money, and made the transition happen. Everything outside of us is wonderful here, but inside our marriage, things have gotten worse.

Religious Shift & More Instability

We had converted to Islam four years ago, and it brought a lot of stability. Then suddenly, after moving, he abandoned the faith, started drinking, smoking, and engaging in inappropriate conversations with coworkers. I told him I was uncomfortable, but he dismissed me as controlling. He often takes me with him to hang out. Maybe like 70% of the time I‚Äôm with him and he‚Äôs actively engaging me and making me a part of the socialization. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm sitting on the side. He says people just feel comfortable around us and think we are cool so they just spill their guts which is just not appropriate and i rather not participate because it all sounds like mess. Drama and mess and inappropriate context. 

But before the farm these instances happened -

One night after a fight, he went to the train tracks and said he was going to kill himself. Another time, he choked me because I stayed up late working as an admin for a friend‚Äôs religious YouTube channel. He called me a ‚Äúpiece of sh*t‚Äù for not prioritizing his feelings over that, even though he was asleep when I started working. After that, he checked himself into a mental institution.

His behavior swings between suicidal, homicidal, or being the sweetest, most loving man. He has moments where he‚Äôs completely devoted, then suddenly shuts me out. He has extreme attunement skills, gives me his undivided attention, wants to be around me 24/7.

After we got to the farm,

Over the religious conversation where i brought my concerns to him about the drastic change and what to tell the kids and how uncomfortable i am with feeling like he ripped everything away, he yelled and kicked me and the kids out of the rv. It took me some times to pack and when we got on the road he text saying to comeback and that hes got to start putting the kids first and that we can live together and maybe something will change in the future. So i came back. 

Now last night we go to a neighbors to sit springs the fire and that neighbor and another neighbor want to talk about sexual stuff. In particular one wanted to talk a bit how he was sexually harassed by a girl who just recently moved back and the other neighbor thought it was funny and just egged it on etc. i was just kinda sitting there nervous chuckling and wishing i was dead. I am modest in nature and he knows that and has promised to keep certain boundaries in agreeance with me. But then he decided not to and there‚Äôs no discussion. He did tell them to steer the conversation in another direction and they didn‚Äôt and i know he can‚Äôt control other adults but i see groups around the farm and this one they constantly talks bad about other people and talks about sexual stuff isn‚Äôt the one i war to be a regular member of nor does it align with anything we planned or promised each other and he acts like im just controlling. Maybe he‚Äôs right? Idk. Well we went home and i said nothing and we enjoyed the rest of our night and i was sweet to him just trying tk ans sense of everything ur j was quiet this morning. He said he was going i. Late so he could help around the house. One of those moments where he‚Äôs like the best husband ever and this does happen regularly.  But i was short and kind of melancholy so he jerk asking what wrong and i kept saying i didn‚Äôt wanna talk about it and that it‚Äôs not an emergency or anything.  After i took the laundry to the laundry room we stepped outside and i told him idk if i really want to be at this farm anymore. I‚Äôve earned him about his overly inviting behavior and how we have opportunity to build friendships with people who hold the same values and he‚Äôs slowly but surely pushing us into the drinking, smoking, cussing , vulgar group despite us being invited to a birthday with managers and owners only and not that that makes them good people by they‚Äôre wholesome and have good habits and that‚Äôs what they want. They could‚Äôve been the Janitor, mailman, chef, poop scooper and i would‚Äôve been happy if they all aligned with us on what‚Äôs important and valued family and doing good. Anyways he listened and then said that he tried to steer the conversation but can‚Äôt control that they do. I told him that i get that but it‚Äôs not about this conversation it‚Äôs about boundaries. I don‚Äôt have people coming up to me telling me who they screwed last night because I‚Äôve established boundaries. He says that means he can‚Äôt talk to anyone at all and I‚Äôm controlling him. I tell him i don‚Äôt want to talk anymore and I‚Äôm going to let the kids know I‚Äôm driving him a cross the street and he says ‚Äúwe already told them, you remember all that‚Äôs hit but can‚Äôt remember that we told them‚Äù

So i get pissed because he does this when the conversion isn‚Äôt going in his favor. He starts jabbing at me so i tell him that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs doing right now ant to stop and he starts yelling and escalating and telling me to just drop him off because he‚Äôs done. So now im emotional and telling him im too old for this shit anymore. And he tells me I‚Äôm crazy and to pull over and let him out of the car on the side of the highway and i say no there‚Äôs 2 semi trucks behind us and he grabs the steering wheel and out his foot in the driver area to press the break. I let him out and drive off then i stop and call him and tell him he better get back in the car because he‚Äôs gonna hear me and that he doesn‚Äôt shit every time. He gets the spotlight off the issue and then just fights with me so he gets in the car and i yell at him and say I‚Äôm tired of this cycle and i didn‚Äôt even want to talk because i knew it would end this way and i said he didn‚Äôt do what he should to avoid boundaries and at that moment he screamed to let him out because im not recognizing that he said to steer the conversation which was him establishing a boundary that the neighbors just didn‚Äôt respect.
He choked me and punched me in the face, grabbed the steering wheel, put his foot down in the driver pedal area. And i called 911. A manger from his job pulled up to see if we were ok and he told them i was holding him hostage and i told him that he punched  me in my face. I‚Äôve never called 911 before despite all the previous instances. 
I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs relevant anymore. I‚Äôm so exhausted and have been for a long time.  

Every time this happens i feel immediate guilt and wish i had said nothing or said the right things. I almost always crumble first. He‚Äôs been my best friend for so long and in such a derp level that i just feel like i can‚Äôt breathe if we are at odds. We have been through alot and faced alot together and even have a 4 year old "

He was originally going to take a plea deal but could not attend the mandated DV classes due to starting a new job apparently.  The prosecutor refused to accommodate him and change the plea deal so the case is going to trial. I just found out today after expecting this to be over. 

I‚Äôm so scared the judge won‚Äôt believe me. It‚Äôs my word against his. I went to the police a week later after staying at his apartment multiple days after the assault and I feel dumb. The only charge is obstruction of breathing because he put his fingers down my throat which impeded my breathing. There is no way to prove this. I did go to the doctor a week later and was diagnosed with a concussion. I submitted photos of my hair pulled out along with a photo of my lip bleeding after the assault. These photos were taken at his apartment after the assault. 

He had submitted security cam footage from the camera that was in his room when it happened as evidence it ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt happen‚Äù. He cut out part of the video (obviously when he tackled me to the ground), the prosecutor found out after examining the footage. That part obviously does not make him look good but it doesn‚Äôt prove that he did anything. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some reassurance and positive words. "

This occurrence I started the fight by being angry, he threw me on the couch and strangled me and I ran into the corner, and he followed and I hit him twice in the face.  He blocked me on everything and kicked me out. Not proud of my actions. Im wondering if I file a report the case would fall back on me since I hit him.

I have BPD and can be difficult with my insecurities and anxiety and had many many episodes but i know he shouldnt of hurt me physically

 I've sent really nasty messages a month prior lmao threatening to slash his tires if he cheated on me- call me crazy- I never did it lol but idk if those would fall on me or irrelevant. He was paying all my bills and helping me out with everything, so i stayed around but honestly I feel like he deserves to live with the consequences of hurting women. "

I have no idea why they arrested her. Is there anything I can do to make things right?

For context: I moved into my apartment about a year ago and I live next to a couple. I have repeatedly heard the man scream at her and call her disgusting names. About a week ago I heard a bang against the wall followed by him yelling obscenities at her and I called the police because I was concerned that he had either punched the wall, or that he had slammed her against the wall. Today I heard him screaming his head off yet again calling her a stupid bitch and telling her to shut the fuck up and I decided to call the police again and explain that I called the other night. When they showed up today, I watched through my peep hole and they spoke to her for a while and then I don‚Äôt know how but she ended up getting arrested instead and she started crying as the cops took her away in cuffs."

I was pretty drunk stumbling, half aware of my surroundings and my memory is spotty. When we got home i got changed into some shorts and a t shirt, i vaguely remember being half on the bed and half off like my legs off still stood up and him coming up behind me pulling my shorts down and well yeah, when he finished he told me i had bled and he left to clean up- i remember crying but stopping before he came back in and when he did he asked me like a dozen times if i was okay. The next day i brought it up explaining i hadn‚Äôt said yes and he told me i‚Äôd just repeated idk to him and that i didn‚Äôt say no. i‚Äôm not entirely sure i understand what happened to me, if something happened to me. 

edit- i can confirm i wasn‚Äôt roofied however i was on medication which made drinking hit harder it was one of the reasons i hadn‚Äôt drank in a while i wasnt blackout but i was definitely not sober id say i was probably like a 7/10 drunk. i think i ended up drinking a bottle of 9% wine then i also had a lot of shots of vodka, captain jacks and malibu we had been playing drinking games and beer pong but with vodka and captain jacks as the mixer. I‚Äôve also woken up sometimes to him touching me down there over and under my pants before but he‚Äôs pulled away the moment ive woken up and pushed his hands away i just feel i should mention this as well.

1j9s6uj,So many lies - how to regain trust in myself,Electrical-Heron-619,3,2025-03-12 19:13:33+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j9s6uj/so_many_lies_how_to_regain_trust_in_myself/,"I just found out he lied about his daughter having (possibly terminal) cancer to keep me around and get money out of me that it turns out he probably used for drugs.

He moved to my country and lived with me for the last 2 months we were together (he‚Äôs gone now thankfully). There had been red flags when we were together in another country but I was in a vulnerable state and made excuses for his behaviour. The abuse ramped up when he was here and was pretty constant - controlling, jealous, manipulative, verbally and emotionally abusive and would smash things in anger. The night I left he came close to attacking me and threatened to badly harm himself in front of me. 

It‚Äôs been heavy unpacking since then and realising all the patterns. 

At one point I‚Äôd tried to put my foot down, he seemed to be having more self control, then one night reverted and it was bad and worse from there. He had told me that night was because he‚Äôd found out his daughter (w her mom in his home country) was very ill. He‚Äôd been unable to get a work permit so even though I‚Äôm currently unemployed we were living off what little I had. I gave him extra money ‚Äúto send back for cancer screening tests‚Äù and from there he claimed it was leukaemia and likely terminal and he needed ‚Ç¨400 for chemo. I was broke so maintained I couldn‚Äôt help but felt awful.

After I kicked him out and he want back to his country, I found a crack pipe in my place. He claimed he never used it and hadn‚Äôt used in 5 years (long before we‚Äôd met).

His mom contacted me today, he‚Äôd stabbed himself in the leg aiming for his artery and she was saying she wants to get him help. First time she spoke to me openly in confidence - it was quickly clear he‚Äôd lied to her about me shutting him out and I took the chance to ask about his daughter as the ‚Äúfacts‚Äù had gotten very confusing. Suffice to say it was all a lie and (thankfully for her) his daughter is fine. He‚Äôd been using since getting back there so was probably using the extra money while here for drugs.

I can‚Äôt believed I shared a bed with this guy. I worked for decades to learn to trust people and he‚Äôs stolen so much of that progress from me. He lied about his own daughter being terminally ill just to trick me into staying with him, put up with his abuse and give him drug money. 

I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm out and fought the first moments of reconsidering, but it‚Äôs just so sad. And now I‚Äôm so isolated all this came out today including getting sent a picture of his leg covered in blood and I‚Äôve no one in this city I feel I can ask to keep me company this evening or just give me a hug as so many of my friendships have become so much more distant. 

Feeling really alone and sad rn so thanks to anyone for reading and just want to skip all these realisations and be over this saga already. "

I didn't talk to my mom from age 11 to age, probably 34 because of a nasty divorce where she hit me when I was a kid. 

Fast forward, now we are on okay terms and my daughter stays with her from time to time. 

She confided in me that her she doesn't want to call him boyfriend, but guy that lives with her occasionally hits her when he gets angry. 

She will not call the cops. She's the type of person that doesn't have a cell phone. Just a landline and lives in the middle of nowhere. No internet etc. 

I felt like if I was closer to her I would probably just handle him myself. He's not a very tough guy. I could lift more weights than him when I was 11 if that gives any context. 

I don't want to get in legal trouble. I'm not sure where to go from here. I also don't want to confront him and then have him kill her later after I'm gone. 

He's a real looked up too guy in their community as well. Church going religious nut.

We, the undersigned, call on Congress to pass the Justice Without Time Limits Act, which would eliminate the statute of limitations for rape and domestic violence cases resulting in injury. Survivors deserve the right to seek justice, no matter how much time has passed.
 
Why This Matters:
 Many survivors delay reporting due to trauma, fear, or systemic failures in law enforcement.
 Thousands of rape kits remain untested across the country, allowing perpetrators to walk free.
 Advances in forensic DNA technology allow cases to be solved even decades later.
Survivors own their DNA and deserve access to rape kit results upon request.
No perpetrator should evade justice simply because of an arbitrary legal time limit.
 
We Demand:
The elimination of the statute of limitations for rape and domestic violence injuries at the federal and state level in the United States.
Mandatory rape kit testing and a national rape kit tracking system.
The right for survivors to access their DNA test results without obstruction.
 Special Victims Units (SVUs) in every law enforcement agency, ensuring trained officers handle these cases properly.
 
Justice should never expire. We urge Congress to take immediate action by sponsoring and passing the Justice Without Time Limits Act. Survivors deserve better.
 
Sign this petition and demand justice today!

I want to break up so badly but I care deeply for him. So deeply in fact that I‚Äôve sacrificed my needs and self worth for the entirety of our relationship. 

We got together in August of 2022, I was 17F and he was 22M. We‚Äôre now 20F, 25M. I thought he was perfect, everything I‚Äôd ever needed as I have not had a good history of  ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù. I consider him my first everything.

It didn‚Äôt stay perfect for long. 2-3mo in he started cheating on me and starting physically altercations and it only got worse from there. I was naive and thought if I loved him the way I wanted him to love me, I‚Äôd fix him. 

In January of 2024, I found out I was pregnant. He demanded I get an abortion, his family even offered to pay for it. I told him no and that if he wants he can be a deadbeat bum and pay for child support. Somehow I forgave him and let him stay. 

He was good during my pregnancy until he wasn‚Äôt. He was getting off to people behind my back and there were 2 times during my pregnancy that I felt my life may had been in jeopardy. I haven‚Äôt told anyone about those 2 incidents. I forgave him, believing he‚Äôd never do it again. But it wracks my brain every single day.

He was so sweet, caring and gentle during the birth of our daughter. Yet somehow still found time 5 days after giving birth to like p0rn on FB of a pregnant woman after refusing intimacy with me during my pregnancy. The incidents that happened during my pregnancy and postpartum have scarred me mentally and feel truly unforgivable‚Ä¶ 

The last time he has done anytbing to jeopardize our relationship that I know of was a month ago. I told him that was my last straw. I tried to forgive him but all of this has added up tremendously. The problem is, I believe he genuinely has changed in this past month. He‚Äôs everything I waited for him to be for so long but I can‚Äôt forget the past. I can‚Äôt trust him fully. I fantasize about being and living alone every single day. Raising my daughter alone, with me. It is effecting me deeply to feel like by staying, I‚Äôm playing with his emotions and his head/giving him false hope‚Ä¶ I care for him deeply but I don‚Äôt know if I love him romantically anymore. Thinking of marriage makes my stomach turn‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôre engaged. I just.. I‚Äôm so at a loss. I wish the best for him truly but I feel at my end, even though we get along well as of recently. He talks to me tenderly but I find myself hating him most of the time. It hurts my heart. He told me the other day ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay if you still hate me‚Äù. Except it‚Äôs not. I believe he‚Äôs changed. I just don‚Äôt know if I can do this anymore. "

It's gotten even worse since then, with her flying into a rage every morning about something I did or didn't do. Yesterday it was because I had forgotten to light the mosquito coils by the back door. The day before it was because I had been playing with our son rather than washing the dishes (of which there were about three dirty plates). Shes yelled point blank that I ""disgust"" her and that she ""hates"" me. It's exhausting and distressing, and if it was just me, I'd have left long ago.

But we have a 3yo child who I adore and he adores me. I spend basically every moment outside of work caring and raising him. We even coslept together. But for the past few months my wife has been accusing me of being an unfit and negligent parent. Her reasons, in my opinion, are trivial, like missing a patch of skin while applying sunscreen or packing the wrong coloured hat in his daycare bag, but she considers my errors life-endangering, either because she is neurotic or because she's intentionally trying to position herself as the primary carer if we seperate.

The thought of having to stay in a hostile relationship fills me with dread, but the thought of only seeing my son half the week or less is worse. My worst nightmare is that I move out a my wife cuts off all contact between me and my son. I don't have the money to take her to court, and even if I did, a trial could take months or even years, by which time my son might not even recognise me.

Anyway, I dont expect anyone to have a solution. I just thought I'd share, and maybe give some insight into why some people stay in abusive or unhappy relationships. Thanks."

About 1 yr later ‚Ä¶ and the mask has completely fallen off - I can see the relationship for what it truly is: abuse, point blank. No sugar coating it. I can see that I do not love this person and we are not ‚Äúsoul-mates‚Äù or ‚Äúcosmically intertwined‚Äù, I am in a trauma bond. I‚Äôve lost a lot of myself, become isolated, fearful, and above all just so gd exhausted - but I‚Äôm not done fighting. Even with this clarity, I‚Äôm having trouble formulating an actionable plan to escape- just to a hotel for 1 night or 2 to rest, to breathe for a second. To make the calls I need to and to re-connect with my local DV organizations to help me secure stable housing amongst other resources. Im ready to leave, I‚Äôm packed, but I have reasonable and genuine fear that if I go while my abuser is home something bad may happen, and I‚Äôm experiencing major brain fog & issues with my executive functioning in general. Sometimes I will just lock myself in the bathroom and literally do nothing for an hour or two bc I‚Äôve been in survival mode so long it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm paralyzed sometimes. Im planning on reaching out to a DV advocate through text but im worried even with writing this I‚Äôm being monitored. He‚Äôs not psychologically well and prone to paranoia and psychotic episodes. I‚Äôm in the Midwest in a rural town 1,000 miles away from my entire family and everything I‚Äôve ever known - my parents don‚Äôt understand the full scope of the situation - hell I don‚Äôt even think I fully grasp what the hell is happening to me right now. Currently there is an active no contact order protecting me from him, but when I was evicted I had no where else to go ‚Ä¶ or at least felt that way ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trespassed from this property, and he‚Äôs been charged with assaulting me (which prompted the no contact) but then we had a situation in which I had to spend a night in jail as well as him for violating my own no contact. So it creates this environment where I‚Äôm scared to call anyone for help or report it because I really don‚Äôt want to go back to jail, it was one of the worst experiences aside from the abuse that I‚Äôve had. My charges got dropped. Also - he got me a cat pretty much as soon as we met, she‚Äôs been through all of it right by me. She‚Äôs sits on my chest and purrs when I have panic attacks, and sometimes the fact that she is excited to see me when I come home from work or wake up in the morning is the only nice and kind thing that happens to me all day. She‚Äôs family, it would literally tear my soul in half to leave her behind. It doesn‚Äôt feel like an option. But I‚Äôm willing to be realistic and make a hard decision if i have to. Deciding to leave is a hard thing, but I can do this. We can get out. I‚Äôve secured a small short term loan from a local credit union and I sell clothes on Depop to generate some more income but my financial situation is dire. No savings, ~$550 in the bank, $40 cash, I have cat food and litter, my ID and cards, my laptop (broken charger I have to get replaced) some toiletries, and anything sentimental that isn‚Äôt too big to carry. I took the next week off after this Friday (03/14/25) when I have a shift at a local coffee shop. I don‚Äôt have a vehicle and im in an Uber desert essentially with one singular taxi that only drives within the city limit or else it‚Äôs sort of expensive. I‚Äôve looked at a couple options on Turo for a truck/car for a day or two but I have limited funds. I‚Äôm struggling to put the pieces together, but staying is only making it worse. So - shot in the dark time. Any advice, tips, tricks, guidance, encouragement‚Ä¶. Anything and everything helps. "

I had to do a larger than normal grocery run, and I am now a single mom so obviously I needed to bring my son. I‚Äôm in a location that the only family around to help watch him is my ex‚Äôs family so that was a no go.

So, due to previous experiences, I HAD TO put my son in the main compartment of the cart. No if, ands, or buts, it had to be that way for my freshly out of trauma, single mom brain to not have the hell raising toddler in the middle of a grocery store screaming that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to sit there‚Äù and ‚Äúlet me go‚Äù for an hour, which garners aggressively judgmental looks. And the 10 trips we‚Äôd taken previously were without incident simply because I let him sit in the bottom part of the cart.

As you can tell, this one was NOT without incident, but I did not know that at the time. 

To my surprise, my son and I completed our entire grocery store shopping experience with joy and random sing-a-long‚Äôs and queued up to an empty cashing lane, to which I was met with, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have your own bags, do you want some but you‚Äôre going to have to pay for them‚Äù to which I met with a ‚ÄúI have my own bags!‚Äù But then looked into the cart and realized all of my items were on top of them so I had to empty the cart (that still contained my happy son) onto the conveyor belt to get to my reusable bags. 

She huffed and puffed, refusing to scan a single item until I had reached the bags, whilst I‚Äôm apologizing profusely, calling myself stupid, and she‚Äôs just huffing and rolling her eyes. 

I have everything finally precariously placed as my son looks on in wonder as I rip the bags out from under the last remnants of the items we had joyously gathered together. 

She finally slacks and asks me to donate $1 to whatever charity, at which at that point I went ‚Äúsure, whatever, that‚Äôs fine‚Äù in hopes she‚Äôd be somewhat less hostile. 

However it continued and she demanded all the items in the bottom of my cart have their barcodes pointed upwards so she didn‚Äôt have to help, so‚Ä¶.without realizing my son was standing up at the end of the cart, I pulled the cart towards me to adjust and then everything went slow motion.

I see my toddler toppling backwards out of the cart, back of the head into the floor. I‚Äôm trapped in the cash out lane between my cart, the person behind me and that damned conveyor belt. My eyes go wide, my son is screaming, I can‚Äôt reach him, but by the grace of god, the teen in the next lane over can reach him and lifts him into the cart so I can reach him. I hold him, he‚Äôs crying, and I realize she‚Äôs 4/5 through my order so I tell her to finish because I won‚Äôt be making this trip again and refuse to restart it the next time as I was checking over my son.

She‚Äôs huffing and puffing all over again, muttering how I should just leave and go to the ER. I already KNEW my night would be spent in the ER, but what SHE didn‚Äôt know is that I had been previously trained and worked as an EMT, so I knew 1) he didn‚Äôt loose consciousness, 2) he wasn‚Äôt vommitting, and 3) he was completely coherent and acting like my simply shocked from getting hurt son. So finish my order, we‚Äôll check out, I‚Äôll frantically drop it at home and grab all the things I need from home to make him comfortable because I know ER visits aren‚Äôt quick and let me go.

So I finish finally, and walk out but a lady from inside chases me down and reminds me to do an incident report in case he‚Äôs more injured than expected. 

I may seem apathetic rn but I was in a horrored shock during all of this. I was beating myself up over finishing the order, over moving the cart that caused him to fall, over being the horrible mom that let him in the lower part of the cart instead of dealing with the screaming for strapping him into the child safe seat. I was horrified. 

But I walked back in with him to do a quick report before the long night ahead. 

To his credit, the manager was so sweet, he was helping me fill it out as my son kept stating how he hurt and had a headache and I sped through the paperwork. But then SHE walked up and went ‚Äúwhy the hell is she filing a report?!‚Äù She turns to me and goes ‚Äúyou know it‚Äôs YOUR fault this happened right?‚Äù
I said ‚Äúyes, that‚Äôs what I was finishing writing in the report, so don‚Äôt talk to me‚Äù
She continued about how I was going to try to sue the grocery store and I was a bad mom‚Ä¶..and to be honest, the thought NEVER crossed my mind to sue because I was simply filing the report so it was there and SHE is the one that made me want to. 
She kept spouting about how I didn‚Äôt care about my son and finally the manager came back with my copy of the report and I left.

 Luckily, after spending almost 7 hrs in the ER, we found out he‚Äôs ok. Which was made easier from the stop at home to get his favorite plushies and tablet and snacks. Obviously if he had been worse off I would have dropped everything and ran out of the store with my son to the hospital. 

But right off rip she was a dick for no reason, then attacked me afterwards. 

My philosophy is that you never know what someone is going through so why treat people like shit right off the bat. You literally have to earn my ire. 
I shouldn‚Äôt have to enter an establishment and go ‚Äúhey, my child and I were abused for years and just got out of it and I have trauma disassociation and memory loss so if I don‚Äôt react appropriately to traumatic situations, forgive me‚Äù.

Ps, talked to her corporate office and stated that I would never want anyone to lose their means of income and maybe just do some training on customer service and empathy.
Because there was no reason for her to run up as I‚Äôm making a report as I‚Äôm basically crying and telling me it‚Äôs all my fault and telling me what a horrible mother I am because my son fell out of a shopping cart."

He doesn‚Äôt do this regularly but when he does he binges for days and does absolutely ridiculous dangerous things. Yesterday he spent the whole day at multiple different bars and it was day 2 of his binge and I didn‚Äôt want me 26f (8 months pregnant) or my child 2f around it so when I got off work I went to our house grabbed our things and went up to my mother in laws house (she lives right in front of our house on the same property) this is something I do when he gets like this to avoid conflict. His mom and I went to where he was and took his vehicle so he could not drive it & we drove it home. His phone was in the vehicle and his mother brought it in the house. This is normal and he usually doesn‚Äôt even notice and just gets his phone once he‚Äôs sober. This time was different though usually he just goes home passes out and the next day when he sobers up we talk he apologizes and we go home and he does work on this behavior. This time though he came up to my mother in laws house and at the time he showed up I was alone with my child in the home. He went around the house banging on all the windows screaming nonsense and kicking things over all over the place. I heard him wanting his phone and I wanted to just give it to him but he was acting so scary and I was alone with my child so I just kept the doors and windows locked and told him to go home and go to bed and went to a safe area with my child until my mil and fil got home. When they got home they started talking with him and he was just arguing saying obsurtities about me and that he wanted his phone so I walked out the door a bit closer to him and threw his phone towards him and told him to go home. His phone hit the ground and shattered and was unusable. He seemed to just see red he was furious I went back inside and my fil came inside and I was scared that he was going to go home and hurt my cat in our house. (I know now I shouldn‚Äôt have gone and this was stupid) He was still on the porch screaming when I decided I had enough time to just go to my house and grab my cat since he was on foot and I was going to be in my car. I left my child with my fil, I drove down to my house ran inside grabbed my cat and as I was getting in my car he slammed the front door causing the cat to get startled and jump out of my arms and run onto our porch trying to get in the door I went to the door grabbed him and next thing I know my husband had pushed me to the porch ground, I had my cat in my arms and was crouched over him in fetal position screaming please stop I‚Äôm leaving please don‚Äôt hurt me he kicked me on my back I peed my pants and before he could do anything else I was able to get my cat and I in the car and back to my in laws. 
He has never physically hurt me before and I do not know how to deal with this situation now. I am being told we are both at fault because I should not have thrown and shattered his phone. I feel as if breaking his phone is not comparable to being physically hurt by him or a reason I should have been hurt by him. I do feel bad about breaking his phone and have said I would take care of replacing it but ive had multiple people now tell me that I warranted the physical behavior and was in the wrong as well. "
1j9e1lr,I‚Äôm a DV victim in Texas,Dry_Owl4100,1,2025-03-12 07:04:05+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j9e1lr/im_a_dv_victim_in_texas/,"I went to my local police department 2 days after a domestic violence incident happened where my now ex bf assaulted me in February I explained to the police officer what happened, I had bruises on my body he asked if this has happened before, if so when.. I told him yes, in January which I showed the cop a video of my ex choking me. He told me an investigator would reach out to me. He sent me a link to submit evidence of my bruises which I did.
2 days later the investigator calls me to meet him at the station, I go and basically he has me explain both January and February incidents from start to finish to him also he sent me the link to where I provided evidence from both days. Picture of my bruises, video of the choking and text threads. That day he also had a girl police take additional pictures of the bruises on my body. I informed the investigator my ex states I hit him but I can‚Äôt recall if I did or did not in the January incident where he choked me in the video.
After meeting with him I emailed him recanting my statement and cooperation with the investigation, that I‚Äôm not pursuing charges nor a protection order.  He called me to verify my ex hadn‚Äôt contacted me to change my mind. I reassured him no we are not in contact and I did not feel threatened in any way. He stated in the email he would note my decision on the report.
From a mutual friend 2 days later I was told my ex met with the investigator but basically he focused on asking him about the physical parts only not the whole story from start to finish like he had me do. He left and was told to submit evidence on the link as well. He stated to our mutual friend that he submitted a picture of a bite mark on his back done from me in the January incident but I truly don‚Äôt recall doing that. I can‚Äôt confirm nor deny. (Note: both incidents I did tell the investigator we had been drinking those days) he says the investigator has not contacted to ask him about the picture of the bite mark on his back because my ex didn‚Äôt remember about the mark until after he had already left from meeting with the investigator. That same week my ex got a lawyer and they just sent the investigator a letter stating they are representing him. The investigator has not reached out to me either. It has been about 3 1/2 weeks already. 
I called the DA victim advocate office in the courthouse they stated they didn‚Äôt have my case # on file and that since no arrest had been made they would reject the case that it‚Äôs up to the police department to make the arrest and that is how they get involved. I told her the investigator told me he will submit the case to the prosecutor and they would decide if the case gets picked up or not. That he said it‚Äôs not up to the PD but the state so I‚Äôm now confused in all this "

I was in an abusive marriage and my ex husband would grab my arms and leave bruises when he would get angry and yell at me. I have a feeling this is now happening to my oldest son. My nine year old came home with bruises on the back of his arm again. A couple of months ago, he one in the front of his arm and it looked like a thumb print to me. My son said he couldn‚Äôt remember and then switched and said it was from running into something at school. This week he has more bruises but on the back of his upper arm, at first he said it was from dad grabbing him and then switched to falling down the stairs. I only have two photos and a video of these bruises. Is this enough to fight for custody or a restraining order if my son says he cannot remember/changes the story? Thank you in advance for your time."
1j9bnzf,Fleeing domestic violence in Los Angeles,DivineLove777777,1,2025-03-12 05:02:07+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j9bnzf/fleeing_domestic_violence_in_los_angeles/,"I‚Äôm in a really tough situation and need advice. My shelter is closing on June 30 because LAHSA pulled their grant due to fraud. Instead of rehousing us, they‚Äôre just telling us to ‚Äúget income‚Äù to qualify for a PATH subsidy. Originally, we were told the subsidy would cover the deposit and part of the rent for the first year, tapering off gradually. Now, they‚Äôre only covering the deposit.

I was laid off while at the shelter and went on General Relief (GR) as advised by my case manager. But now she‚Äôs giving me the runaround, and since my GR is ending soon, I no longer qualify for housing assistance through it.

I‚Äôve been in the shelter for almost a year, and I‚Äôm beyond my breaking point‚Äîmentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I don‚Äôt feel safe here. I even had to issue a cease-and-desist to the main site coordinator for verbally assaulting and harassing me. I‚Äôve never been homeless before; I‚Äôm here because I‚Äôm fleeing domestic violence.

Recently, I got an offer for a fully remote state job‚Äîmy dream job. I‚Äôve been applying for months, and this is the only offer I‚Äôve received. But I have nowhere to set up an office, store paperwork, or hang professional clothes for video calls. The department hasn‚Äôt confirmed whether I need a hardline internet connection either. My car is literally my only space.

Now, my case manager suddenly tells me LAHSA has a housing program for people with mental health diagnoses. I got documentation from my therapist confirming PTSD and depression, plus verification of my physical disability. She says this should make me eligible, but she doesn‚Äôt know when LAHSA will get back to me. I‚Äôve been here for a year‚Äîwhy is she just now telling me about this when she‚Äôs known I‚Äôm fleeing domestic violence?

PATH is income-based, so I don‚Äôt qualify until I start working. I filed a grievance with LAHSA about the shelter closing with no rehousing plan, and they were shocked. They said it‚Äôs against their policy to exit people without a plan. The person I spoke to said she‚Äôd look into it, but I haven‚Äôt heard anything since. Apparently, the shelter was supposed to find a new grant, not shut down entirely.

When I tried to push for answers, the site coordinator basically mocked me and told me I should be ‚Äúlooking for housing.‚Äù How am I supposed to do that when they withhold info about internal programs? I also went to the Department of Mental Health for help, and they told me they don‚Äôt do housing‚Äîyet people from my shelter have gotten apartments through them, with rent covered and Section 8 vouchers, even though they weren‚Äôt fleeing DV or disabled.

I‚Äôm supposed to be on the emergency housing list for DV survivors and disabled individuals, but I have no confirmation that‚Äôs actually happening. I also reached out to D.A.R.T. about DV housing, and they were supposed to follow up with me today, but I haven‚Äôt heard back.

I feel like I‚Äôve exhausted every possible option. Does anyone have viable suggestions? I have to take this state job, but I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to succeed without stable housing."

We have technically stayed together during this time but ultimately over the last 2 weeks I felt very confident in my choice to break up with him, I had hard days with normal feelings of heartbreak but I knew I would be ending the relationship. I wasn‚Äôt sure when or how but I knew I was ready and I was slowly detaching from him and us. 

This past weekend we went to a wedding out of town for his brother (none of his family knows about the abuse or any of our business) and it was an amazing weekend and now, since the incident that happened in the beginning of February- I feel attracted and truly attached and in love with him again. He has been dedicated to me and making things work after everything that happened and I never reciprocated those feelings until now. I know we can‚Äôt be together and it can never work out realistically, especially because of the fact my friends and family know about the abuse and I know I can truly find a healthy love one day. But I can‚Äôt help but feel back in a headspace/ trauma bond that I thought I had grown from. 

Is this a normal thing to happen in abusive relationships? Is there a possibility I can get back to the mindset I was in before this weekend? 

I‚Äôm turning 25 in a few months and don‚Äôt want to waste more time with someone I know I can never be with but I‚Äôm still so in love and attached to him as I thought he was going to be the man I married. "
1j96yzs,I've put up with this shit for 12 years.,Existing_Phase1644,1,2025-03-12 01:01:33+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j96yzs/ive_put_up_with_this_shit_for_12_years/,"For context, I live with my folks. My step-dad is hard of hearing, and my mother is an A type personality with a history of domestic abuse that was trained into her as a kid. I, myself, don't drive, have a difficult time finding work of any kind, and at 40, post attempt, with PTSD, just livethrough this continued hell.   
Day after fucking day.  
We walk around on egg shells because who knows what the fuck is goingto set her off. She lashes out whenever she feels like it, saying it's back talk whenever I have a conversation with her, or whenever she hears something she doesn't like.   
She pushes him around a lot, insults, degrades, punches, slaps him, justifies it by saying his mother did the same to me once, or if her mother or father were at the house, we'd be getting our asses whooped, but since they aren't, she will.   
She's only hit me a few times, mainly because I put a stop to it for a while, and the last time i simply let her, because it was kind of justified. Ate more than I was supposed to.   
I've basically stopped talking in general, stopped trying to figure out a way to get my life on track, battling with light to medium depression, and just focus on what's in front of me. She tends to start arguments for no reason other than to try and start an argument, threatens homelessness and yeah, my resume isn't the greatest.   
I hate living here, but I don't have anywhere to go.   
Since I've failed to get into the military she's been verbally and emotionally abusive,  manipulative, and randomly starts screaming throughout the house.   
I get it. 

I'm 40, should have my life on track at this point. But that's still no excuse to hit me or her husband and then get offended when we call her out on it. I've gotten numb to it, no point in letting what she does to me both directly or indirectly affect me anymore then it already has.

There was a moment, just weeks after I had gotten ack, after I had broken up with my girlfriend at the time, where I really needed someone to talk to, it was a mental spiral that really fucked with my head. I tried approaching her, but she said she didn't have time for me. The next few moments after she left were a blur, thankfully, the attempt didn't take. 

now a days? I just try to get through the day as blank minded as possible. I don't date, I don't invite people over, I don't go to the campus. I just sit around waiting for a heart attack to take me so I don't have to live through this fucking hell anymore.   
I'm alive for some reason, still. But I don't think god or whoever made the right choice in letting me live. At least, that's how i felt back then. Now a days, I just.... try not to think at all. "

I think once I am able to unite the whole thing it will be easier to move on. But it‚Äôs just so hard to do; my brain can‚Äôt reconcile that the same guy who moved mountains for me also pushed me down them. He was my abuser and my best friend. He was kind and evil.

I feel very stuck. I have been in a abusive relationship for about five years now. 


The last year has been the best year I have made a lot of steps forward. Cutting contact a lot of the time for maybe a month, two months at a time but I always end up going back, the cycle usually starts as okay will be friends and then the friendship starts to become possessive, he‚Äôll usually will turn into the person that is abusive, mentally questioning me about everything who I‚Äôm with what I‚Äôm doing, isolating me from having a life outside him things like that. 

The issue that seems to keep me stuck is that I seem to want to still be civilised with him or on talking terms? Or that I feel like I don‚Äôt want him to see me in this bad light? 

I feel like verbally he has always been so hard with accusations on cheating and other guys that I feel the need to be this ‚Äògood girl‚Äô and prove that I‚Äôm not out or with anyone else- this will include us staying in contact and just being friends but him feeling the need to know inner details about my personal life. 

For example, we aren‚Äôt speaking momentarily because I went to see a physio and he flipped the lid because it was a man. 

I can‚Äôt live like that, I won‚Äôt live like that. 
But I really struggle with not reaching out to nearly fix his perception or getting him to understand why I‚Äôm innocent. 

I really hope this resonates with someone, I‚Äôve been in therapy, doing amazing work on myself and know I will come out the other side of this and finally cut the cord. 

I think with this post I‚Äôm really looking for coping mechanisms in the mean time, things to not make me feel awful and keep me from contacting him to ensure that he knows I‚Äôm a ‚Äògood girl‚Äô as such. 


I‚Äôve came such a long way from reactive abuse and the girl I used to be would be so proud, I just feel so stuck on these end parts and trying to fix these bad habits. I‚Äôm nearly 1000% sure he knows what he‚Äôs doing by this silent treatment and accusations because he knows it‚Äôs the only way to reach me.

Thanks for letting me post this and vent. And I really appreciate anything that might give me some help with this. "

Local authorities have been called, APS, Mental Services Mobile Crisis and Sheriff. Sheriff did NOTHING. Basically just told them to stay away from each other. Mobile crisis says it‚Äôs in sheriffs hands and APS just gave us numbers.

He messed with her car where she is staying at her friend‚Äôs house, so it‚Äôs still a problem. 

Should I bother to keep trying to get authorities to respond? Or just get her a new apartment and leave it alone? We don‚Äôt want him to go to jail, we just want him to get treatment, but neither is happening. I am always scared cops will make it worse not better because that has been my experience. She doesn‚Äôt want to deal with a restraining order because of the court aspect, time, and she has to work, move and is scheduled to have a surgery soon.

Important information before this night they have asked me to partake in a 3sum with them and I have declined. They are not my type and I don't want to ruin an old friendship. Well Anyways skip forward a few months from that conversation and were out drinking and I'm already alittle over tipsy and that conversation comes up again. This time being alittle drunk I told them that I didn't know if I would or wouldn't have a 3 sum with them. We'll they continued to buy me drinks throughout the night until I was so drunk I couldn't walk and had to use there arms to help me up. We'll we get back to there place and ended up hooking up. The next morning I left and just went home. We never really talked about it again and technically I said yes but I was also really drunk. Now I just can't get it out of my mind we have hung out multiple times since then and nothing has happened. But was I taken advantage of? Is this considered rape since you can't constant while drunk? I would have never done it sober and feel ashamed about what happened and that i continue to hangout with them. But shes my best friend since we were little and i dont have anyone else I talk to. I need input please give me your thoughts and advice.

We have been together since the 21 April 2024 and I've been the only one who worked to this day.

Even if i have quit my job on July i still managed to sell item (my loved Pokemon card collection or Hunter x Hunter collection, vr headset, Nintendo switch and a lot of stuff) to buy food and other stuff like theater or date together.

But recently i have nothing much to sell and couldn't get a job (live in France) so we just eat bread with nothing else.

And he have helped us with max 50‚Ç¨ worth of groceries since April 2024.

He we're kicked out of is house because tbh we are ""not like usual couple"" cuz we are 2 men that love each other i guess, so this isn't a simple situation (is mother is horrible she never said hello or thx you to me).

But after that safe place that my parents and i offered to im, and all i have done he keep saying me to get a job and 1 hour ago he just told me in front of my mother that this is MY PARENTS that's feeding him and not me, like i never done it before, at cost of what i have worked for to afford and cherish (god i miss my collections), he even add that he loss 3killograme in a week (cuz we don't eat so much) but said it like it's my fault.

I know i'm not perfect, like no one is.
But I've always do my best and i don't know what to do and worst of it, I'm starting to think i don't do enough even if i got nothing to give anymore.

I just feel that I'm been used, what I can't bring my self to believe.

He is also very unpleasant with me for no reason sometimes and insulting me freely (i do it too, but not that much and mostly just to respond to is aggressiveness)

He used a lot of ""then i broke up with you"" emotional blackmail.

And everytime we argue it goes really far and 2 time i told him to leave he just hit me and slap me.

I could add more details but i feel like i said to much and i just need answers to this question.

I'm i doing enough ?

Does abuse of me financially ?

What should i do or what i could do or he could do to get this better ?

The relationship and relationship advice told me le to post this here so i do

Im afraid the next time i will told I'm he do the same btw."

1j8vz4x,I need guidance on helping someone experiencing DV,doofydink,1,2025-03-11 17:14:09+00:00,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j8vz4x/i_need_guidance_on_helping_someone_experiencing_dv/,"So I (21m) am a student living in a smallish college town, and have known this girl (22f) for about two years now. Over these two years, she‚Äôs become one of my closest friends, and at this point we‚Äôve both admitted that it‚Äôs become more than that really. For context, I work a part-time job and she is also one of my coworkers. One day she showed up to work with CLEAR signs of a physical altercation happening between her and her bf (bruising under the eye), and since that day I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about it. This was about 8 months ago. Around the same time, my roommate was moving out so I was gonna have an open room in my apartment. I ended up telling her that if she ever needs a place to go for a night or to even move into that she is absolutely welcome, and she pretty much said yes on the spot, but warned me that it would take a long time for her to be ready. 

Since then, she‚Äôs told me more about her situation. She ran away from home and moved in with this guy when she was 16, and mind you, this vile dude was my age when he had her do that so not only is he an abuser, he‚Äôs a groomer. He constantly insults her, tells her she‚Äôs useless and that he hates her and doesn‚Äôt even want her around, so the abuse goes beyond physical as well. From what she‚Äôs told me, there is nothing left but a trauma bond in their relationship, and she tells me everyday how she can‚Äôt wait for it to be over. 

Currently, she still wants to move in with me whenever she can, and I‚Äôve made sure she‚Äôs still comfortable with that plan. I try not to push her to do it too hard because I know just dropping everything in your life and leaving on a dime is no small choice, and as well as that I know she‚Äôs trying to avoid doing the same thing that got her into that situation in the first place. I guess what I need guidance on is, what can I do besides just wait? Should I get the police involved if I ever see a physical sign like that again? Should I be encouraging her more? Will I be putting myself, or worse her in danger by inserting myself into her life like that? I‚Äôm 21 and never been in a situation like this so I may be in over my head trying to help, but I see so much of myself in this person that it hurts me more to watch and not do anything about it."
1j8uxcc,Reporting my ex partner for sexual abuse,AggressivePassion835,1,2025-03-11 16:31:18+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j8uxcc/reporting_my_ex_partner_for_sexual_abuse/,"*TW: sexual assault, grooming*

I (24F) know that I should contacted the police regarding this situation, but it‚Äôs more complicated since it mostly involves coercion and sexual abuse so I‚Äôm unsure if what he (34M) has done is basically a crime. I don‚Äôt really have much proof in my end either since I have him blocked off everything, and I later consented only to please him. I‚Äôve also had another former partner of this person speak to me regarding an incident where he was choking her out, and she thought about contacting police but never took action; I‚Äôm not really sure if I want to speak directly to police agencies since I later gave in to what he did towards me even though I never verbally consented what he did to me (long story short, he‚Äôs into hard BDSM, rape fantasy scenarios, and humiliation kinks in which the second time we had sex he just put this onto me without warning).

This situation is also extremely complicated and fucked since I‚Äôve known this person ‚ÄúFoley‚Äù since I was 17 (2017) We met at this retail store I worked at, and he was 27 at the time; we didn‚Äôt start becoming friends at least until I was 18 by the time I was in college. By the time I left college at 22 (2022), we started hanging out and during that time we began seeing each other again for 6 months. But we was still inflicting these weird kinks, and I only stayed because I loved him and wanted him to stay. I broke things off with him because I found out that he was in a 2 years relationship with someone else (‚ÄúI‚Äù) in which she told me more about his behavior including when he choked her out.

Recently around last August, Foley reached out to ‚Äúmake amends‚Äù but only for us to resume seeing each other romantically. But it was only for 4 months, and honestly things became worse; the last time we saw each other, I had a traumatic sexual experience with him which led to me finally cutting things off and blocking him for good.

I‚Äôm now realizing the fact that his behavior was abusive and the grieving process has been tough. Some days I‚Äôm okay, but then I find myself crying and feeling helpless because I don‚Äôt know what to do or what action to take against him. I go to therapy to talk about everything, in which my therapist suggested that I should possibly speak to authorities about this. But with what proof? I literally have nothing to show, and I feel like a lot of things would be used against me since I reconciled with him the 2nd time and later consented to everything afterwards. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a grooming type situation, but he would often comment during sex that he‚Äôs wanted me since I was 17 and it‚Äôs just fucking weird and disturbing. He would say how much I was ‚Äúin love‚Äù with him at this time, but it was only a crush. We barely knew each other or were even close the first year we worked together.

I feel awful because he‚Äôs also in a situation in which he‚Äôs possibly at risk of getting deported, and part of me wants to submit a tip no matter how fucked up it sounds (if anything, that‚Äôs the last thing I‚Äôd want to do). Overall, I feel extremely helpless and I don‚Äôt want to face rejection from authorities from the fact that I don‚Äôt have much to show  on my end.

*update: I contacted my local police district and they suggested for me to come in to speak to an officer. As for them pressing charges and something actually being done, it depends on whether a detective would be able to accept my case*"

Just feeling alone and hoping to hear from someone out there. I've been with my husband since 2020. He's always been controlling/possessive, we started as a long distance relationship and I thought things would ease up when he knew that I was fully invested in him. As time has passed, the verbal abuse is still there, but physical abuse grew as well. I'm in another country with him alone, and I'm just sad. I feel like he took everything from me. I don't really have friends anymore or anyone to talk to. Right now I'm at a hotel, I'm staying here until I get paid and can afford a ticket to go home, not for another week. He always blames everything on me and says that I take no responsibility for anything. We had a perfect month, and once my period starts everything blows up. It's hard for me to take the verbal abuse when I feel emotional. I feel guilty for fighting back. I feel guilty that he says I ruined everything and wasted so many years. I feel heartbroken because I love him anyways. I can't stop crying, and I always question myself. What if I just found a better way to swallow it all? Maybe it would all stop. We had so many dreams for the future. We were going to move to my country. I still question how much better life would be if we did. Where I could be the one to have more of a lead. Maybe then he would see the real me more and not think I'm stupid, and lazy, and pathetic, and a piece of shit. It's hard for me to do things here, I don't speak the language, and he always says I'm just lazy and don't push him to go out and do stuff together. I know I don't deserve it, but I know I'm not innocent either. I want kids, I want a family, I feel like I'm wasting my life trying to get things to be better when I know they won't. I feel hopeless and crushed. I just don't see anything positive right now and really need some help. I love him through it all, but I know I'm just stupid. At least he'd agree with me on that part "

So now he‚Äôs resorted to punishing me by bringing my close familial relationships and other triggering info into the fights that is in no way relevant. I‚Äôm used to the regular slew of insults and garbage. Last night was absolutely insane and a step further into more crazily abusive territory.

He fought with me for TWELVE hours. He started with me at 9 PM, accusing me of being in a ‚Äúbad mood‚Äù when absolutely nothing was wrong. Fought with me until almost 3 AM. I desperately tried to disengage and end things. I fell asleep for 3 hours. He woke me up at 6 AM, and fought with me until 9:30 AM, forcing me to stay awake. He did all this so that he wouldn‚Äôt have to do something for me today that we had planned to do all week. I called him out at the beginning of the fight and said, ‚Äúare you picking a fight with me so you don‚Äôt have to [do this thing for me] tomorrow?‚Äù He easily proved me right.

I quickly debunked everything he was arguing about and finally lost my mind because he you can only be told you ain‚Äôt shit and deprived of sleep for so long. I called him out on his own bullshit and he couldn‚Äôt handle it, so he went back to his usual DARVO responses ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt love me üò§‚Äù ‚Äúyou hate me üò§‚Äù ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt give a shit about me üò§‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so ungrateful üò§.‚Äù And it‚Äôs so funny when I pull up conversations of me being the world‚Äôs greatest most loving attentive thankful girlfriend. 

I‚Äôm so fucking beyond exhausted, they are energy vampires and not allowing me to physically sleep was absolute insanity. I‚Äôm used to being abused and torn to shreds but I‚Äôm not used to literal physical torture. Especially because I take prescribed sleep/anxiety medication that makes it harder for me to stay awake, causing confusion and also rendering the medication useless because my adrenaline fights through it. Then I have to take more to achieve sleep/fight intense panic, putting me in a negative position with my doctor and pharmacy. "

He said no and he wanted to go with me, so I said something along the lines of I don‚Äôt know what would be considered a good freezer and we can kill two birds with one stone while he looked at it and I did chores. He just said in an annoyed tone ‚Äúwell never mind we don‚Äôt need to get it‚Äù. I got annoyed because he always does this rolled my eyes and left the car without saying anything (likely closed the door a little hard but not slamming it) and started getting the groceries out of the trunk. 

He got out slammed his door and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre always such a bitch to me‚Äù and I again said I thought you can look at it and come back, if we want it we can get the truck out and go back together.

Last night I saw a few posts from his new gf saying my ex is kicking her out after she was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. Apparently he gave her three days to leave, turned off the electricity in their place so she would move out (paid for it to be shut off and then paid for it to be turned on after she left), stole some of her stuff, and tried to defame her to the people close to her. I'm not sure if any abuse took place before this, from the rest of her posts about their relationship she seemed happy. 

He threatened to kick me out multiple times and held my housing over my head almost daily, knowing I didn't have a safe place to go to. I feel really bad for her. I also feel like I could've done something to prevent this if I had just reached out and told her he's abusive.   "

And while I did it because I didn't want this girl to get trafficked (she came close to being trafficked), and I didn't want her dying... I don't want to be her friend. And important context, she is his parents' next door neighbor so you can see her car if you're over there. And he asked me to literally be friends with her and he wants me to fuck up her life from the inside. And I asked him how the hell I would even do that, and what he was on about. He told me that he wants me to convince her to get behind the wheel while really drunk. And that he hates seeing that car, and a big reason he was talking to her while we were on break was because he loved her car, and it's supposed to be his (even though her mom bought it for her) And it annoyed the hell outta me, because you mean you put me through all that stress not only for an ex, but for a CAR. He has a nice convertible already, I really don't get it??? 

This could all be an effed up joke, but it's wild to say in the first place. But I really don't know if he was being serious or not. 

Also this all started because she called him from a textnow number and started saying that he was holding the rehab thing over her head, and that triggered him. And that she thought him and his brother was following her, which he claims isn't true, they were just leaving at the same time. And I know he went to go play basketball with his friends so idk. "

Things were worse in the beginning when we both were heavy drinkers, but we both quit and things got better. I used to have to lock him out of a bedroom because he would follow me around screaming at me. Recently, he's been pushing me to work more and I'm also going to school. I am busy a stupid number of hours a week...60+ between school and work. He wanted me to go back to school, but then started complaining because I'm not doing enough housework and not being intimate with him, both emotionally and physically. It feels like the goal posts are always changing and more and more and more is being demanded of me, no matter how much I'm already doing. I'm exhausted. Burnt out. 

We got into a fight and I left to cool down and pick up my meds from the pharmacy. I got a nasty ""where the fuck do you think you're going?"" text, and then he decided to leave to go out drinking. When finally came home hours later, he demanded to see my phone, accusing me of cheating on him because I left. He woke me up screaming at me, and then fought me for my phone, wrestling it away from me. The kids heard it all. I took the kids and left. I haven't been back. 

He's begging to reconcile, and some part of me wants to believe it was only the alcohol that caused  the violence, but even before that our relationship had many issues. I don't know if there's any way for this to get better. And I can't stomach the thought of living with him again, or normalizing this behavior for our children. Or putting in more work and effort when I'm already so exhausted. Everything he texts me about is pushing to meet up, talking about how hard this is on him, and I still feel like I'm getting no consideration. He's being extra nice, but it feels fake. I feel like he just wants me back in the house with the kids, and nothing else (my feelings, my trauma, my happiness, the kids' wellbeing) matters as long as he can return to normal.

I just don't know where to go from here. I mean, I know, but I'm having a hard time. I feel like I'm stuck in limbo. I guess I just wanted to make a post in a space where people would understand. Thanks for listening. "

Ex was sent back from work yesterday and I didn't realize how drunk he was before leaving, as he usually leaves when I come home from work. He came back from work after being sent home, and our car was messed up because he had ran over a mailbox. He came back crying and I immediately knew something was wrong.  

He had stopped for another beer and had it cracked open. He was crying and freaking out and I tried to calm him down and get him inside to drink water and sleep it off. But he immediately turned angry when he got out of the car and his screaming alerted a neighbor. Well, the neighbor watched and waited to intervene until she saw him swing on me. He hit me twice and I feel like I egged him on because I told him to back up and not do it because his probation would be screwed. He was on probation for strangulation and assault where we cut off complete communication until he was solidly in therapy and attending classes. 

Well, he fled. It was dark and we live out in a very rural area. The state police searched for an hour with two people before leaving. 

He came inside and a camera caught him so the police were called again. A very unprofessional officer told me I could be charged with aiding and abetting (? Correct spelling) if I didn't call and he showed up. I proceeded to explain I didn't know what kind of mood he was in and I wouldn't be able to call them if he simply shows up and dude rolled his eyes. The second time, they showed up with four-five state police officers, only one was a woman. They left after two hours.

The third time they showed up,  he fled somewhere new. I wanted this to be over because it was around four in the morning and I didn't want our little one to wake up (she's 3). I communicated with police that I would throw a blanket and hoodie outside for him and where he would be and they didn't catch him then. The same officer that threatened me with a charge on the last visit then demanded that I quit playing games and tell them where he went. Again, I didn't know. I had an inkling of an idea, but they were searching the few streets around here and not the woods like I'd said. 

The last final time he was caught inside, hiding in a crawlspace in our house. He came back to say goodbye to our daughter and apologized for his actions even though  üíØ know he would do it again. 

The same officer was there and I can't remember the last stupid comment he made, but I finally threatened to file a complaint. It took them 45 minutes to get here from one town over (a 20 minute drive). He apparently was the Sargeant. 

I just feel insanely guilty and depressed. I was on the phone with him for 6 hours that night, and he wouldn't tell me where he was, but I wanted to listen to see if or when he'd be caught and he wanted to talk about things we had repressed during prior arguments. He hasn't called from jail yet, and I feel like I'm going through the motions but not really here. I'm taking care of my daughter but not myself, and now have to worry about daycare and a new vehicle... And I feel horrible and I miss him and I know I shouldn't.  I just keep remembering how awful it felt to be on the phone with him, just waiting like that and our last hug and I know he wouldn't be violent towards our kid ever, but now I'm fucked up inside because he'll be in there 4 years if not longer with new charges.

1jcogvv,Am I being abused,,1,2025-03-16 15:51:28+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcogvv/am_i_being_abused/,"I didn‚Äôt know what to title this post because it‚Äôs a lot and I will probably end up deleting..

My fiance (27M) and I (25F) have been together for about 7 years, since our late teens. In that time, we have had some very crazy insane arguments. Currently now in our mid to late 20s, nothing is really wrong. But fianc√© cannot stop bringing up the past to rehash and yell and belittle me over.

For the first few years of our relationship, I was very bad at communicating. I invalidated, and I name called, I escalated arguments, I did it all. He spent years calling it out to me and ‚Äúbeating it‚Äù into my brain so that I would stop these behaviors. And for the most part (aside from the random attitude or eye roll) I have stopped. And I‚Äôm thankful that he was consistent with me and helped me change , and I tell him this. He also uses this against me quite often currently, to make me feel exactly how you would think. Another situation that gets brought up often is when (3? Years ago I think) I texted a male coworker to play a video game together: flirting. Nothing more happened but that did betray his trust. When caught, I started an argument and name called. I admit to this every time he brings it up and apologize. He also was texting someone (6 Years ago) and had a plan to go over to their house for sex, but I‚Äôm not allowed to ‚Äúuse that against him‚Äù because when I caught him, he admitted it immediately and apologized. There‚Äôs a whole lot more that I can‚Äôt add in or this would be way too long. Things like him organizing and me having trouble keeping it clean (I‚Äôm the only one working) - this an excuse to yell at me. Me not being psychically affectionate enough (I‚Äôve validated and I‚Äôm working on it). He says that he‚Äôs the reason our daughter is so considerate and the way she is and if left to me, she would be- fill in the blank with anything bad. If I even come inside the house and he perceives I have an attitude and I don‚Äôt get rid of it- argument. He has anger issues and punches things, yells at me, gets in my face, calls me names, these outbursts lasts for hours. While this is happening, I‚Äôm usually bawling my eyes out, listening, apologizing, telling him all the ways I will make up for it and make his life amazing. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. Last night he admitted he‚Äôs been having dreams of punching or choking me out and he can feel that it‚Äôs my fault. I‚Äôm nervous to even post this because what if he sees. And like I said, nothing new is happening because I‚Äôm a better partner now, but he has trauma. And I don‚Äôt know how to help I‚Äôm through it. He says if I just put a lens on where I enrich his life and he‚Äôs always at the front of my brain , maybe that will help. Honestly I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm even posting this, I just feel so helpless and hopeless right now. Does anyone have advice?"
1jcntmi,I left last night with my baby,CampApprehensive2213,28,2025-03-16 15:22:28+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcntmi/i_left_last_night_with_my_baby/,"I posted a while ago. Things were great again until they weren‚Äôt. 

He was wonderful for the rest of my pregnancy. Wonderful with our son.  I have so many photos of them together that now hurt to look at. 

The last two weeks have been horrendous. I actually thought his cruelty was caused by alcohol‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs been sober for about nine months. Having a baby was extremely motivating to stay on the straight and narrow. But time passed, he got stressed, and he got so unkind. 

He was yelling and screaming at me all day yesterday in front of our baby.  I‚Äôve never felt so defeated. He bought alcohol for the first time in the evening and I only figured it out about an hour after he got home and screamed some more. 

I recorded it all and I finally tore the bandaid off and sent one of the videos to a friend who convinced me to leave. 

Last time he bent my hand back and hurt me. I was pregnant. This time I didn‚Äôt stick around long enough for him to touch me. 

I feel so so bad for taking my baby away from his father. He loves his baby. 

The whole thing was humiliating. I was in a hotel lobby crying with a screaming baby going through all my bags looking for my credit card. My phone was blowing up and I was trying not to look. 

Then we get to our room and baby is inconsolable for about twenty minutes. I‚Äôm crying. I‚Äôm FaceTiming a friend whos also crying. Now this morning I can hear all the noises in the hotel and I know how thin the walls are and I‚Äôm just so mortified. 

I know it‚Äôs for the best but it feels so bad. I‚Äôm so scared he‚Äôs going to hurt himself. 

This is all his fault and he ruined everything with his actions but I feel like I‚Äôm the one who ripped our family apart and I can‚Äôt ever go back"

Our fights often includes him threatening to leave (I play into it and always end up stopping him- and when I admitted in a couples therapy session that sometimes I'm so tired that I think about letting him go, and he got mad and brought that up at a later fight (like bro- wtf)), but recently in lieu of that, he shouted he no longer wanted to do couples counseling and told me to cancel the appointment. Our relationship was always a bit rocky due to family issues but it seemed to really get bad in the past year or two.

Currently, we are almost a week in on him giving me the silent treatment, which is not super unusual when he gets mad but will often put it aside for household comments (bills, groceries, etc.). But the other day I mentioned something about groceries and he snapped at me, 'don't talk to me, text me if you need to.' The silent treatment escalated to straight up hostilely ignoring me, and this AM I told him morning, and asked how he was feeling, and he snapped again about texting him and not talking to him. I hear him talking to the cat and he's normal and sweet. He just texted me that this is how it's gonna be until further notice and to communicate only through text and that if I can't respect this boundary to let him know.

I know my normal meter is fucked up because of my own trauma and family issues (which is something I'm fixing with therapy, but my SO is impeding it a bit because I need to talk about us) but yeah... In all ways I feel like I've been set up to fail, feel no support and so weak, and I'm so sad."

I can barely forgive them. I know I have to maintain boundaries, grey rock them when they inevitably end up coming to see the kids. 

How do you handle the awkwardness? The constant effort to set and maintain boundaries? The desire to print out self help pages and make them see the light? The instinct to reason and logic this person into new behavior? The disappointment that they face such relatable problems and yet can't seem to resolve them reasonably?

Yesterday, I had a rare day off and ended up at his party later. I went inside to use the restroom and eat and started chatting with two guys across the counter from me and asked how they knew him. He came in and got upset that I was ‚Äúgone for 20 minutes‚Äù and what was I doing? He was insinuating I was up to something. He disappeared for a bit and then asked me to come to his room to discuss what I was doing. He didn‚Äôt seem satisfied that that‚Äôs what I was doing. He kept getting angry. Then he got pissed and asked me to leave. I went downstairs and was telling people bye, and he came down and pulled me physically away from them wanting to talk about this again. Yelling at me in front of people. He then hit me with his phone in the forehead. I walked out and left. 

After I left, I got a text from him saying ‚Äúgreat seeing you. Let me know when you get home!‚Äù My mind was blown. Then, HE blocked ME on everything. Obviously, this is doing me a favor, but why would someone act this way, not apologize, and then block the person they hurt?

I told them to delete them and report it, but I had to explain to multiple friends what was going on, it‚Äôs stupid for him to get to me through my friends, they shouldn't have to worry about that and quite frankly I never wanted to discuss this with anyone again but since it's out there, I could really use some advice. I'd rather just forget it, but now I can't because he's making it everyone's business and messing up my social life. 

This is why I never post on social media and make my life very private. It took me hours to explain what was going on and it was humiliating, he forced my hand yet again and I'm still playing his games. I can barely do anything about it. I'm out of my mind. I don't know what to do. This has happened multiple times, but this time he is going after my friends. 

He has it set to a picture he took from me as well. I let my guard down and this happens. I'm at my wits end. I can't do it anymore. 

It's worth mentioning, on February 19, he harassed me and pretended to be someone else, I told him I couldn't do this and left him hanging. Then he made an account (different from this one) to send a long apology saying he never wanted to force me to engage with him, that he loves me, that I deserve better, and that I should block him after reading it. I ignored it. But instead of respecting his own words, he came right back to contact me again. That's the level of ""respect"" he has for me.

Thank you Reddit. Appreciate it in advance."
1jcka3t,I just need to vent‚Ä¶,Fit-Luck69,4,2025-03-16 12:23:18+00:00,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcka3t/i_just_need_to_vent/,"TW - Emotional abuse, drug addiction, gaslighting


Hi, 

Im sorry if this comes off as poorly written, I am emotional. didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge what I may be going through and I didn‚Äôt want to post here because it solidifies what my fear is. 

I think I am being abused. I suffered from abuse my childhood, my school life and in a few relationships as well. 

I thought I escaped it all. I told myself after my second last ex I‚Äôd never be abused again. What has happened now? I am with someone (who mind you, doesn‚Äôt even want to make it official yet) who just treats me like absolute fucking shit 90% of the time. 

I spoke to him for months and now have moved to another state to be with him. We spend basically everyday together for the last 4 months. 

He is just so disrespectful. He constantly critiques everything I do, constantly puts me down, blurts out completely rude insults/word vomit, lashes out on me, blames me for everything wrong, gaslights me when I tell him I‚Äôm upset and downplays it - then blames me, barely apologises, refuses to have any emotional conversations with me - I try to set boundaries and I‚Äôm a ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù or he stonewalls me, he doesn‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm sad, he constantly is being defiant towards me and the list just go on and on‚Ä¶

He is a drug addict to one of the hardest drugs. I consistently blame the addiction on the way he treats me. I justify it to myself his actions because of his adhd, autism and addiction. He downplays me so much and says he‚Äôs ‚Äújust joking‚Äù when he hurts me and that I‚Äôm too sensitive. I‚Äôm constantly apologising for lashing out back. When I speak politely asking not to treat me like that, it doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve started lashing out a lot because he won‚Äôt listen when I try to communicate kindly and maturely. 

He takes advantage of my kindness. I do everything for him. I have a full time job and he doesn‚Äôt work. I clean, I make him food or buy him food, I drive to places to get him stuff without him in the car. 

The guy doesn‚Äôt even like hugging or kissing me, he spends days awake playing games while I‚Äôm alone in bed. Not to mention he‚Äôs never touched me sexually - only me giving to him. He has a reason for this and I respect it. But still‚Ä¶ sucks feeling so rejected often. He also doesn‚Äôt compliment me, never has called me pretty or beautiful. Closes is when I ask him if I look pretty or good and he says ‚Äúyeah‚Äù very bluntly. 

The thing is, I‚Äôve seen his good side when he was sober. He never love bombed me. When he‚Äôs sober he genuinely is so much better. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just the drugs or him in general. 

Why the fk do I allow myself to be treated like this? I‚Äôm too much of a coward to leave and be by myself. I‚Äôm constantly trying to improve myself mentally through therapy, groups, reading up, working on myself. 

I also sacrificed so much for him. I moved far away for him, I had cosmetic work done on myself to impress him (he never asked btw I just wanted to be perfect for him) I try so hard. 

I honestly feel so pathetic for staying. I feel pathetic that I can‚Äôt see a way out and I just hold on to hope that when he‚Äôs sober he‚Äôs better. I genuinely feel like I have no respect for myself and I feel so damn alone. I don‚Äôt tell anybody because it‚Äôs embarassing. I don‚Äôt want to tell people because it means it‚Äôs true. If he just showed that sensitive side he showed before when he was sober it would be all I need. I don‚Äôt ask for material items, I don‚Äôt ask for much honestly. He acts like showing me affection is an inconvenience. 

I just don‚Äôt understand how somebody can treat someone else like this. I feel like a shell of a person,  I just want to be loved. If I leave him I have nothing left. I‚Äôm stuck in this state until my lease ends at least and that‚Äôs not for awhile. I‚Äôd have nobody. I don‚Äôt want to leave him because I do love him so deeply. But I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm being mistreated. 

And it‚Äôs crazy because I am so educated on abuse, and yet I make excuses. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm turning a blind eye on it because of hope. 

I think I hold on too because he doesn‚Äôt show other typical sings. Like love bombing, jealousy or controlling behaviour. 

I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on anybody. I pray everyday that things will improve and I know my situation is nothing compared to others and I look like a fkn fool for staying. I know I‚Äôll get shat on because it is my fault honestly. I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a victim or ‚Äúpity me‚Äù but I‚Äôm being completely raw and transparent right now.  

I don‚Äôt know what the point of posting is since I don‚Äôt want to be told to leave him. I would like some success stories with people improving but we wouldn‚Äôt be on this subreddit if that was the case, plus I don‚Äôt want other people to get false hope in abusive situations either because that‚Äôs harmful. 

I have so much compassion and love for everybody else but myself. I am trying so hard to love myself and I just can‚Äôt. Never in my life. No matter what I‚Äôve done. 

I hope there‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel. I just want to be loved unconditionally with the same energy I give to them. I feel not good enough and like a waste of space. I sabotaged my life by moving here and staying with him after I saw the red flags. I knew and know better. "
1jck1hn,Trying to figure out if I'm in an abusive relationship.,crystalH0908,3,2025-03-16 12:08:49+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jck1hn/trying_to_figure_out_if_im_in_an_abusive/,"Ever since I first started dating my partner I feel like I've been slowly trying to be controlled and made to change. In the very beginning of the relationship my partner tried and succeeded to fast track the relationship. Which went against everything I believed in because of how my 14yr marriage with children ended. I always take things slow, I like to be friends first with a person I date first. I'm very old school in this department and have dated few men in my life, so far, and a couple of people for months and I never even became intimate with them(in any way) because it just never felt right or happened. My partner wanted me to give over all of my emotions and to act as if we had been dating for months, even though it had only been 2-3 weeks into the relationship and when I didn't that's when he began to tell me that there was something wrong with me. That I was emotionless, had no feelings. I was like a robot for being wary and wanting to taking things slow and get to know him better before I just gave over my heart and all the benefits and actions/behaviors that go with that. He told me that I should be texting him like every hour or so, with stuff like ""I'm thinking of you,"" or ""I miss you,"" and when I didn't or argued that what he was asking was a bit much and didn't seem reasonable. He would once again proceed to tell me that I'm the one who wasn't thinking correctly if I didn't agree with him and that something was wrong with me for not thinking like him. He would have expectations of me and want certain courtesies and behaviors from me that he, himself, wouldn't do, or think he shouldn't be required to have the same expectations or behaviors and this theme has continued through the entirety of our relationship, so far. Whenever we argued it was always me who's wrong and if he was ever wrong it could never be just his fault. It would also have to be partly my fault or I made him react the way he does. He constantly tells me I'm lying, when he has no proof I have been. He will tell me that I'm lying about things I'm thinking and feeling when there's no way he can even prove such things and will insist he's right even when I tell him what he's saying is incorrect. He constantly finds things about me to be upset with or to find fault with, even when everything is going fine, especially when everything is fine. Goes into my phone behind my back. Not that I care I have nothing to hide but will get worked up and anxious if I mention going into his phone like he has mine and will say only if he's there right next to me and can dictate what I can look at. He has put his hands on me 3 times. He's never punched or slapped me but the first time he forced me to kiss him, after an argument when he was leaving and I didn't want to and I was pulling my head away from him and out of his hands. Then he grabbed my head and forced me to look up while he forcefully kissed me and even hurt my mouth with how hard he did it. The 2nd time was in the car, and I told him to drop me at my place and that he wasn't to come in because we were arguing. When we got to my place and I tried to get out he gripped my jacket with both hands to point it was cutting into my arm and wouldn't allow me to get out of the car. I repeatedly tried to get out of his grip and out of the car for about 10 minutes before I slumped over and started crying because I realized I was helpless to do anything. Which reminded me of my very violent first marriage. My ex-husband put me in the hospital, raped me, and almost took my life and my partner knows this. So when he did what he did in the car it took me back to that horrible time in my life and I felt ashamed for feeling like I was back in the same situation. He finally let me out of the car and then proceeded to taunt me about not seeing any tears even though there's no way he could because I put my sunglasses on because mascara was all over, under my eyes, from crying so hard. Once I got to my apartment door I tried to shut the door on him but he slammed his foot in the doorway and I ended up just letting him in because I didn't want to make a scene with my neighbors right there. The 3rd time we were in bed and he hit me in the back with his vape because he thought I fell asleep smoking a cigarette in bed, which I hadn't. My back was to him and he couldn't see my face. When I addressed these situations with him, after they happened. He would tell me I was lying about how I felt and what I was thinking when he did what he did. Would say I was over exaggerating what occurred and that I was lying about him physically hurting me. To this day he sees nothing wrong with what he did in those situations. Even though he knows what happened to me in my past. I'm going to stop here for now. There is more stuff but he'll be getting up soon. Some feedback would be great because as he sees it and keeps telling me it's me that's the entire problem in the relationship. He's been relentless about calling me a narcissist, insisting that I am one that needs therapy, and that he read about the signs of a narcissist and that I have them. He even admitted joining a Reddit thread about narcissistic partners/spouses and when I asked what my signs were the only thing he's ever told me is that I get quite when we argue and I stop talking or I just refuse to interact. I've told him that is I coping mechanism I developed from the relationship with my physical/mentally abusive ex-husband because the more I tried to fight back, explain myself, stand up for myself. The worse the beatings were and he knows this. Again any insight would be helpful and thanks in advance."

It is 5:37am and I have what's left of my basic necessities (plus a few of my ""wants"") in the car with me. I say ""the rest of"" because I had moved out over 2 weeks ago after I was called a ""lazy PoS"" for the last time... my aunt and uncle offered me a place to stay for a few months and I've been staying there. I am in a parking lot now because I don't want to disturb my aunt and uncle so early, and I was staying at her house after a show just to have a place to sleep. I was on the couch, and it erupted into a fight more than once.. it escalated so quickly... so I left, except for a few occasions, for good... 

I do feel a sense of relief.. i keep to myself in my new home. I enjoy the peace and quiet. My aunt and uncle bicker, but it doesnt bother me. It's not my issue, and it's so nice to be in a place where everything isn't my fault and I'm punished for it. 

However... this is the most heartache and pain I have ever felt.. I cannot provide my dog a good home so she's keeping her. I can see her whenever, but that means going back, and that hurts in multiple areas. When i travel, i will tske my dog to my gigs, but then i have to take her back until I can get my own place... I've gone back several times to help wjere I felt responsible, and every time what started as help turned into an expectation and then the cycle started again and I would leave again and ust reopen all the wounds that can't hea - due to my inablility to cut contact completely because I feel compelled, to a fault, to do the right thing... it is a blessing and a curse..

This hurts so much.. Overall, I am okay. Not wanting to ""end it"" at all, so to speak. Haven't even thought of it. No harm has been done to myself (which used to be an issue). In this sense, I am extremely proud of how strong I have been, but there is deep, deep presence of pain and hopelessness... When I invisioned leaving, pain was never in the equation, but it seems to be a majority of what I'm feeling. I don't understand..

Why does something that is ultimately *extremely* positive for myself so painful... "

I have a pattern of falling for the wrong guy, trying to fix people, and prioritizing others over myself. Recognizing this was one thing, but breaking out of the cycle was another. A year ago, I was too broke to get therapy, so I started reading self-help books and made a list of the qualities and values my future partner must have. I took time for myself and reflected on my own unhealthy patterns. I really want children someday, but I don‚Äôt want to raise them alone.  

In September, I slowly started dating again. But this time, I thought more about who my future children would have to call their father rather than what I found exciting. In December, I met a guy I wouldn‚Äôt normally go for, someone I initially thought was boring. But he matched my list perfectly. I kept seeing him, and he turned out to be the kindest man I have ever dated. After two months, I started to develop real feelings for him.  

I promise it‚Äôs worth it. I feel so safe with him, but I am also my own person. I don‚Äôt have to carefully choose my words, we just talk.  

Please give the ""boring"" guy a chance. He feels boring because he doesn‚Äôt stress you out."

Ever since DDay, he‚Äôs been viciously defensive, compulsively lying and verbally emotionally abusive. He‚Äôs also pushed my sexual boundaries after the affair ended. 

I‚Äôm definitely getting my life in order to leave him, he‚Äôs not my person, he‚Äôs a monster and an ass hole who‚Äôs pretended to love me for 3 years. 
I can say there were some signs in the dating stages of our relationship that I thought weren‚Äôt big enough to cut him off for, but I can now see it was warning me to discontinue what is now resulted in an abusive marriage.

1jcduc9,Ghosted after chemical pregnancy,Aggravating_Big6638,1,2025-03-16 04:41:25+00:00,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcduc9/ghosted_after_chemical_pregnancy/,"
I (36f) have been dating my boyfriend (35m) for about a year. We live together. 
The whole month of February I‚Äôve been feeling like I have the worst PMS, kept feeling like my period was going to start.

My boyfriend went on a two week work trip across the country. The day he left, I started my period but the cramps and bleeding were so much worse than normal. I felt suicidal. I told him I had to end things with him because I was afraid he was drinking again on his trip (he is about 7.5 months sober) and that I was going to the hospital because of my suicidal ideation. He didn‚Äôt respond to my messages.

At the emergency room, the doctor told me I had tested positive for pregnancy and was having a chemical pregnancy miscarriage. They gave me an ultrasound to make sure it wasn‚Äôt ectopic and then sent me home. I am devastated. 

I had a stillbirth with my exhusband over a decade ago and this brought up all the pain from that. I had mostly given up on being a mother because of the scarring and fluid in my fallopian tubes, so getting pregnant this was unexpected. One of my early signs of pregnancy is suicidal thoughts and mood swings; this happened during my first pregnancy as well.

I messaged him when I got home from the hospital apologizing for my hormonal mood swing/suicidal thoughts and for being paranoid that he was drinking. I asked him to please call me. He didn‚Äôt respond. I called him and he didn‚Äôt respond. I poured my heart out over texts about what happened and asked him to please call me. I called his voicemail and cried, begging him to talk to me. It has been five days and he has completely ghosted me. I understand if he needs time to process what happened, but I wish he would have communicated that to me instead of ghosting me. 

I‚Äôm not only losing the pregnancy, but losing him. Just a few weeks ago he held me in his arms and told me he wanted to start a family with me.
He gets back from his work trip on the 22nd. I was supposed to pick him up from the airport, but I guess I won‚Äôt be now. 

All his belongings are in my home, including important ones like his car, the title to the house he is renovating, his desktop computer‚Ä¶ I wonder if he will come gather his possessions himself or continue to be a coward and send his parents.

I feel devastated. I thought he loved me and I believed all his promises for our future. I know he is ghosting me and not hurt in an accident or something because he is still active on social media. The pregnancy hormones are fading and I‚Äôm feeling more like myself. I will go all day keeping my mind off of the miscarriage then feel like I can barely breathe when a wave of grief hits me. 
It is hardest at bedtime. I have never felt this alone. 

My last message to him was: You wanna know what hurts more than losing a pregnancy? Being abandoned by the man I loved while I went through it.

This is one of the cruelest things anyone has ever done to me. There were times were I would see a mean side to him and I always worried that he was love bombing me or using me. I should have listened to my gut because he flipped his love off so quickly, I doubt he ever loved me at all. I keep wondering what I did wrong to make him abandon me when I lost his child. How can he hate me so much to be silent when I need him most? His mask has finally come off and I see that he is cold and cruel.

She told me they got into an argument because he liked some girls picture on instagram, and they started to argue. So he choked her out while their 2 kids were sleeping, left her unconscious in their apartment, stole her car, and left her for dead. She told me the only time he doesn‚Äôt put his hands on her is when she‚Äôs pregnant. üòï 

I actually didn‚Äôt know this was a normal thing for her then I remembered actually seeing her with a busted lip before but she blamed it on her toddler son. There was another incident when he showed up to our job, and was looking for her and she was hiding from him. Anyways, after he almost killed her on Mother‚Äôs Day I told her to leave him because he could‚Äôve killed her, and left their kids without a mother. Honestly, I believe he was trying to kill her. He didn‚Äôt stop until she lost consciousness that sounds exactly like attempted murder to me. Eventually he won her back by I guess love bombing her, and buying her stuff to get her back. It‚Äôs literally a cycle. Im still very concerned for her well being because she‚Äôs having another baby by this abuser, and I fear he will continue to abuse her. I truly believe he only continues to get her pregnant to keep her stuck, and unable to leave. She has told me before she would struggle really bad without him. I am worried one day he will kill her, and leave their kids without a mother. I tried to give her solutions. I even told her we could go in on an apartment together because she deserves so much better. But I know trying to get her to leave will only result in me getting cut off as a friend and I do genuinely care about her. My old best friend is in a similar situation and cut me off because I tried to get her to leave her abuser. 


Anyways, just wanted to vent about the situation close to me. I hope her, and the babies are safe everyday. They don‚Äôt deserve to be without a mother, and I‚Äôm worried about what they‚Äôre exposed to with a man like this around. If that man strangles you, and hits you he will kill you. Nobody can ever convince me otherwise. "

Hiding that he gets cold sores and passing it to me when, I was a new mom (still gaslighting even though, he admitted it to derm).. Now, I suffer from frequent Hsv1 and OCD..


 we live extremely near his parents and would complain about me to them.. They also enjoy hearing about my faults (Both FIL and MIL).. This family hasn't treated even one of us (including my co-sister and co-brother) nicely.. They shame us publicly and privately.. My husband has slapped me multiple times infront of our toddler and has abused me both privately and publicly.. He is extremely nice to my family even, has helped my father with his business and provided financial aid. Which my family has repaid half the amount.. FIL even had the audacity to re-hire an employee who, my father has fired.. Even if I wanted a divorce, my family has no support to offer.  I'm shit scared of him.. I don't know whether to expect his good or bad side.. he is extremely loving to his nephews and nieces but, only rarely graces his loving side to my daughter.. I can't ask anything,  speak, or go to work.. He even accused me of talking my lover infront, of his relatives (I was sending a birthday wish to a female friend which,  I told him while typing the message).. My daughter loves him and his family though.. Maybe when she grows up.. I want a happy marriage.. He won't come for counseling/ normal talk with me.. I often see him, providing interest free loan to his company's staff. So, that they won't leave him.. he rarely provides for us and my father supports us (be it medicine,  milk. Groceries, etc).. 


I also feel sorry for him. He is hardworking and doesn't come from a good household.. His father nearly killed him while, dunking him in water when he was about 8 months for more than 5 times (just for irritating him). I dread waking up next day in this household.

Today after I saw him flirting with random girls at the store we went to, I was feeling a bit irritated. We go to a local market for groceries and someone asked if we were married. I said that we weren‚Äôt, and they proceeded to ask if we were engaged. Sometimes since I‚Äôm shy, I get a little bit uncomfortable and don‚Äôt know how to answer, since technically we are not engaged since I was never given a ring. I guess I was a bit brash and said ‚Äúmentally we are.‚Äù Which I know was kind of mean maybe, but what I meant was that we aren‚Äôt formally engaged. In front of everyone, he told me to go f*** myself. I really didn‚Äôt want to drive home with him (he has full control of my car), because I knew that he was going to drive recklessly. It was worse than I expected. I was sure we would get pulled over- scratch that I was PRAYING we would, because it was so scary. He then said, ‚Äúf*** you, I will marry a b***h on the corner.‚Äù He had said things like this before, and I often feel like saying, ‚Äòokay, if that is what you want then do that.‚Äô 
We sharply cut down a tiny alley going 65 miles an hour. As we flew out onto a street my brand new tire blew out. Of course he blamed it on me and said it was my fault and this is what happens when you are disrespectful. I didn‚Äôt say anything, I‚Äôm surprised we didn‚Äôt get killed, so maybe I should thank my lucky stars that was all that happened.

At one point I started to cry and he tried to keep going but it took me actually crying a bit for him to stop. He also would just force it in and used his hand to open my mouth. I tried having a discussion with him about it today and he says it was ""CNC"" but there was no discussion about it beforehand (we've talked about ""no limits"" days but that was months ago, we had no agreement to do it last night), no discussion of safewords, and he didnt do aftercare. I have a lot of evidence against him including him saying ""you kept going"" after i told him it wasnt consensual when I was saying no/stop/i dont want to, and then I said because he was forcing it and he said ""thats what facefucking is"". I also have the condom and havent showered yet so I could get a rape kit done, but I feel conflicted about it. He also made me puke on it when I said I didn't want to. This isn't the first time he has done this with me/crossed my boundaries/not respected the word ""no"". But last night was bad. 

I'm just conflicted about whether I am overreacting or not and should press charges. He is my FWB and we aren't exclusive. He treats me like shit. But I don't want to hurt him how he hurt me? Part of me still likes him and wants to see him again? It's so confusing. But I'm hurt and dissociated and sad after last night. After I told him I didn't feel good about last night and it wasn't consensual he said I should come over to his tonight so he can use all my holes. 

Any advice appreciated. "

She would leave voicemails to them saying they are evil people. She would always tell me it's just me and her and that my dad would eventually leave.

I wasn't allowed to have social media but downloaded it and hid it at night lol.  She never would go out with me and my dad but maybe once a year, bc she had to put on 4/5 hours worth of makeup (expensive) makeup. (She paid bills with my dad's money and we almost lost the house bc she was using the money on her make up, even tho she didn't go anywhere except the store and doctor to get her oxycontin (since I was 5 her hysterectomy ""went wrong"" and she needed 100smg of oxy a day plus zoloft and lorazepam)

She would take them all and go doctor hopping so my dad would put them in his car to take to work so she would only have what she needed that day. Well even at 11/12 I was ""too young"" to stay home by myself! So she would take me with her to break into his car (smash window/etc) to get it. Shit triggered a panic disorder in me.

This was around 13, she started going out with her extended family more. Turns out, she started cheating with her cousin, and left my dad. Never even had a custody thing bc she had no money for a lawyer and I didn't want to stay with a cheating, jobless, psychotic whore anyway. 

My dad finally started giving me freedom I never had, he would go out on weekend my my grandma would watch me or I'd be home alone. Around this time I got into weed. The bullying at school was easier when I had a good smoke to come home and look forward to.

Well by the time I'm 14 he starts dating this ugly,  2 pack a day cigarette christian-fascist woman with 2 kids. Within 6 months she burned her house down and moved in with us. She started setting new rules my dad didn't have, like I can't close my door with my gf in there (my dad didn't care as long as I used protection) but he said I needed to listen to her. She said I would burn in hell forever if I had sex before marriage. I also walked into MY OWN HOUSE to her and my dad fucking as loud as possible in MY room with door open, they had been dating less than a year and weren't married.

At this point (15) I spent summer with my grandparents who let me and my gf close the door lol. Same way they used to do for my dad. ""Yall gonna do it regardless we just want ya to be safe""  around school time they bought a new house 5min away from my grandparents and wanted me there so ""we can be a family"" I said no take it to court (I was 16 now). And never turned back.

I developed BPD which led to opiate addiction, the girl I dated at 15 that my stepmom told me I couldn't have sex with lasted until 21, we had a house together at 17. It failed bc I had serious trust issues and even tried therapy at 16, but my grandma, bless her heart (she doesn't force religion on me) got me a Christian ""psychiatrist"" (religious idiots should not be allowed in medicine) that I just agreed with everything he said and he said ""he seems perfectly fine with me!"" And I never went back or got help. Eventually got into Gma pain pills and when kratom saved me from that at 17/18, my gf and I lived at my grandpa's old house below them.

After a few years down there, one of my best friends from kindergarten all thru high-school hangout for first time in years bc people said I was weird for only hanging out with my girlfriend (she was my bff 100%) so we hangout and decides to do some coke like we did in high-school. I did it and he said ""there's some heroin in it to ;) I ended up addict3d, destroyed my life, my gf got hooked, we broke up, I went to methadone clinic to get help and try to get right so we could get back together and methadone clinic gave me 200mg but you have to take it THERE, they don't give you take homes here. So I blacked out bc they gave me twice what I needed. 

Well, I killed someone and got 25 years in prison, suspended thankfully due to the fact IT WASNT MY FAULT I TRUSTED THE DOCTOR. And now here I am back at grandparents, who are Grey now and GPA prob has alzheimers:( with no friends, no girlfriend/bestfriend or even dates. My ex is getting married now.. I'm finally sober but I can't get her back, our old house sold and demolished to pay for legal fees. I think my time on earth  is almost over guys. I don't have a plan yet but it's coming :("

He said I was awful and had never stooped so low to choose food and alone time over ""discussing"" our relationship. I should say, he was okay with me getting food but just wanted to carry on the argument. 

Similarly, he has been mad before when we were arguing for hours until 2am, and I was so tired I begged him to let me sleep. He said I was choosing sleep over the relationship and said similar things about how awful I am then. He brings it up to this day, that I chose sleep over our relationship.

That dark evil look that he has where I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on behind those eyes. I had a feeling the first night I was going to have sex whether I liked it or not. The look, that dark look told me I was right. I‚Äôm a bit older now, my body - especially my vagina, can‚Äôt handle the rough angry pawing of an abusive drunk man. I didn‚Äôt want sex. I went to sleep and woke up with it already in progress, his hands and mouth on me and in me. I disassociate and freeze when this happens. This is not consent. This was not love. This was him abusing me. The roughness, of course, caused some bleeding. I didn‚Äôt want to see it in my panties when I used the restroom, it‚Äôs traumatizing, so I had put a tampon in. I was shutting things out and shutting myself down. Disassociating. Feeling out of it. This happens a lot. One time 2 yrs ago it happened 3x in a week, not sure if 1 out of the 3 was anal, but I do remember he whispered something nasty in my ear as he got off of me that night. This time I did something I don‚Äôt normally do. I had wiped the bleeding away with a tissue. I threw it in the trash. The next morning, I picked it out of the trash and put it in a plastic bag. To remind myself? To say to myself, look - blood! Blood does not equal love! That night I put on a skims style body suit thing that goes to mid thigh, no holes or anything for my butt, you have to pull the whole thing down to use the restroom. On top of that, I put a sweater with very difficult to open buttons. The buttons are pearls and diamonds that snag and are cute but non functioning buttons, essentially. That‚Äôs what I went to sleep in. I have opened the buttons on that sweater like twice since I‚Äôve gotten it, bc they are difficult and it‚Äôs easier to throw over my head to put it on. That night I woke up because I was cold. I was naked. There was wetness. My knee was in a wet spot on the bed and my butt was wet and there were things being dripped onto my black side. My face was in the bed, and my butt was in the air. My knees were bent slightly spread. There was something in my asshole. I don‚Äôt know if it was his dick or fingers as I was in the process of waking up. I said no! Stop! And he grabbed me by the hips and pulled me back to him. I think the reason he went in my butt was because I had the tampon in. The tampon was in not bc of period, but due to his actions the night before which caused the bleeding in my vagina. So one night I get it vaginally, the next night I get it in the ass. I missed an event with the kids bc I got agitated and stressed and then I realized it was because I had lube coming out of my asshole. The first three images are what I wrote before he raped me vaginally. The second was after the anal rape the next night. He‚Äôs not having sex unbeknownst to himself in his sleep. His actions are deliberate. He knew and knows what he‚Äôs doing. I can look back and see that when this has happened before, that I was doing things for myself or better handling things emotionally. I thought I could suppress this one too. Only I couldn‚Äôt. The thought of giving his number to my surgeon‚Äôs office as someone to call in case of an emergency? I stuttered and started shaking. He had also told me it would make him happy if I died on the table during surgery. When I looked shocked and got up to leave he, of course as always, said it was a joke. It was just a joke. All the mean things he says to me, that‚Äôs just a joke or no he doesn‚Äôt remember saying that or flat out no he didn‚Äôt or he tries to change what he‚Äôs said. I‚Äôm in the process of trying to move out but y‚Äôall, there‚Äôs still that part of me that says the kids, it‚Äôs easier with kids to have two parents in the house. I work (according to him don‚Äôt contribute or do enough). I volunteer. I am shattered and can‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so hard to love me. I am broken and feel like emotionally I‚Äôm a burden to those around me and toxic. I live in a small-ish town, but I‚Äôve developed some friendships here and a small network here that I would have died without having. My health has suffered so much from this, to having a thyroid disease to a heart issue to debilitating allergies (celiac/dairy/nuts/etc). I don‚Äôt know what to do. My gp and psych say to make a police report and pursue criminal charges, but isn‚Äôt that for law & order svu? Ironically, it‚Äôs one of my favorite shows. He hates it and will not watch it/ allow me to because he says his ex wife used to watch it. Part of me wants to reach out and talk to her to see why they really got divorced. Did she experience this? I also found he has the Grindr app from august 2018 until it disappeared from my view (not necessarily ended, app could be hidden) May 2024. I don‚Äôt have money to afford the lifestyle, for that matter neither does he. I have two little ones here, and they are amazing and wonderful spirits that I can not believe I am blessed to be their mom. They are my little superstar heroes, they are so accomplished and do so many things and activities from sports to art to dance. I can‚Äôt let them down. I will not fail them. But I have, because I can‚Äôt give them all of me and who I am, all the good if me because my shine is so hidden by the walls I built to keep my heart beating and my lungs breathing. I tried to suppress it all and I crashed on my bike. Numb to the pain. I couldn‚Äôt cry. I couldn‚Äôt have an orgasm while masturbating. I used to be able to handle this and disassociate. I can not anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm running down a hill but I can‚Äôt control the direction. I‚Äôve been cleaning, that‚Äôs good. But I am so afraid I‚Äôm going to back slide and agree to stay with him. He‚Äôs the one who has screamed divorce at me hundreds of times. Now that I‚Äôve agreed (in November), he now doesn‚Äôt want to get divorced. I told him we are, I‚Äôm looking for a place yet he keeps sending me info on houses like it‚Äôs all normal, and that since he‚Äôs moved on from ‚Äúthe argument‚Äù I should just forgive him and move on too because why can‚Äôt I just forgive him. Don‚Äôt think there was one conversation about it, he doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it just wants me to ‚Äúforgive him and love him‚Äù. I need direction and strength, it‚Äôs hard to trust my thoughts because that‚Äôs how he‚Äôs made me be. My definition of love unto me is love=pain. I need strength to get through all of this. I need a lawyer and I don‚Äôt have money for one. I am lost but still need to lead, the kids and my coworkers. I am aware that I‚Äôll be pegged as the Xitch and bad guy in the divorce. I wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for letting me vent. No one knows the whole story of my marriage, it‚Äôs humiliating. Embarrassing. Traumatizing. Violating. Terrorizing. It‚Äôs so awful, silently I hate to see those happy people showing support and kind love to each other because I don‚Äôt know how that feels nor have I experienced that in a long time. I have a glimpse and a glimmer of hope now, but I don‚Äôt know what to trust anymore. He‚Äôs out of town until April, and I dread the return intensely. I have a quiet thought on repeat, when I‚Äôm making dinner or cleaning or breathing. It‚Äôs help me help me help me help me help me. I need to help myself but I‚Äôm so soul worn and broke tired of it all.

1jbxy01,I Think I Might be in Danger,ChewsFoodOnlyTwice,2,2025-03-15 15:43:54+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbxy01/i_think_i_might_be_in_danger/,"TW: Self harm 

Today is the first day in my life that I thought I was in serious danger by a romantic partner and I'm not exactly sure what to do. My partner has never physically abused me but I think he is trying to convince everyone around me that I'm suffering from severe postpartum depression, a danger to myself and our 6 month old. 

I'm not. I have struggled with suicidal ideation my whole life but since giving birth it has been non-existent. I suspect because I have a much stronger sense of self preservation now because my baby needs me. I have talked about this extensively with my therapist and mentioned it several times to my husband. 

We're going through a divorce. A contested divorce because he won't agree to a divorce. Last week he reported me to CPS for a whole bunch of stuff that were either straight up lies or not abuse at all (he told them that I keep threatening to get a divorce.. my divorce lawyer accompanied me and we all just kind of paused for a second..) one of the things he said was that I was suicidal. I told them that was absolutely not true. I have a whole team of medical professionals that I meet with regularly to make sure my medication is working and that I have emotional guidance. I have a therapist I meet with once a week. I have support groups. I released my therapy notes to them to prove that since I have given birth I have not expressed that I am a danger to myself or others. 

After the meeting, hearing the things he accused me of, and having explained what was actually happening (he is intimidating me into thinking that if I go through with the divorce I won't get custody) I was afraid of him in a whole new way. The accusations were wild. The idea that he would accuse me of abusing our child or worse for divorcing him (he reported me the same day I told him I was going through with the contested divorce) was terrifying. Those types of actions have real life repercussions. 

I went home to visit my family (my step dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer this week) and while I was talking about the DCS meeting my family members started telling me that he has been trying to convince them that I am suicidal and homicidal for months. He called my mom and told her he ""knows the signs"" (he doesn't.. he knows nothing about my mental health conditions because he doesn't like talking about it and he screams at me every time I try to talk about it) h told her that I'm in a dangerous place. She was obviously like ""No I know my daughter better than you and I know what she's experiencing right now and it's not that"" and he argued with her! Yelling at her to not ""downplay this"" because it's ""serious""! She ignored him and just shut the conversation down. Last weekend I left a family event crying because I was given the cold shoulder (gee I wonder why.. know now that he's been saying outlandish things about me) and he called my brother and my mom and gave them weird cryptic messages that hinted at the fact that I was in immediate danger. My brother showed up at my house before I got there. My mom called me frantic. It was ridiculous and I told them it was ridiculous. I was just normal person sad about a normal person sad event and I wanted to go home instead of being in a place I didn't feel welcome. 

I remembered this morning that he occasionally tries to tell me I have said some very very strange things in the past that I KNOW I haven't because I have never even had the thought or feeling related to them. He sold his car a few years ago to buy something and now he's trying to convince everyone I made him sell his car so that he ""couldn't leave me"". Which is absolutely ridiculous. I do not want to force someone to be with me and I'M THE ONE WHO IS TRYING TO LEAVE. 

I have been thinking about all this stuff for days because it doesn't make any sense to me. He doesn't want a divorce but says all these wild things about me. He doesn't work and that's part of why we're getting a divorce. He says I can't make him work and I say he can't force me to financially support him and I will divorce him if that is what it takes. So why would he be doing all this stuff? He needs me to keep a roof over his head. 


It occurred to me that when I was once hospitalized for suicidal thoughts (before I had the baby) they called him to ask him if he was comfortable with me going home. At the time, we joked about it because that's a potentially dangerous situation to put a woman in. I told him how once when I was hospitalized I met a woman who was running away from her abusive husband and he called the police and told them she had snapped and was a danger to herself. She was in there for over a month. She had to go to court and get a judge to order her removal. He did. 

It occurred to me today that it's possible he is trying to get me into a hospital for ""postpartum depression"". It would get me out of the house (that I own) and paychecks would keep coming in (from my job!) because I would be out on medical leave and he could idk. Use that to prove I'm an unfit mother in court? I don't even know what the end goal is. I don't know what's going on. But I'm afraid to go back home. "

Just said he was going out. I did some things around the house then called (he didn't answer) and texted him to check in, asked if he'll be out for much longer. He didn't reply for about a half hour so I decided to go to a bar I like to have a drink, get out of the house. When I told him I was going out, he immediately jumps to accusing me of going to meet guys, saying ""Enjoy whoever you end up with wherever you're going,"" ""Enjoy whoever you meet wherever you're going,"" ""I'm sure you'll get the attention you're looking for,"" ""You'll pick up some [instagram] followers in the coming days I'm sure."" When I said he was being demeaning, he said ""You're being delusional."" For the couple hrs I was at the bar, I sat in the corner by myself,  writing in my journal and texting with him, trying to hold back tears. I was going to get a second drink, but didn't want to end up getting more emotional, so I went home. He texts me at 12:30 saying he'll be back soon. I went to sleep around 2:30 and he still wasn't back.
I cant stand to even look at him right now. He's going to justify every fucking thing he said and make it all my fault. Again. "

I am sorry if this is a useless post or insulting to survivors on this thread but I have been thinking back on my relationship that I just escaped.

I (23f) and him (22m) meet in college and it goes really well for the first two months. We were together for a total of five months. I had never been in a relationship before him and had no frame of reference for proper relationships. He was very kind and loving for the first couple months. 

He went out of his way to see me or do nice things but I always had a feeling that something wasn‚Äôt right. Not in an obvious ways but I would feel anxious at the thought of being in my apartment alone with him at the start or I felt I couldn‚Äôt dress fully comfortable around him. Then he would get drunk and he would say mean and degrading things to me and I did try to break up with him when he first said that but he said everything I wanted to hear and did everything a girl could want. 

A week later we celebrate his birthday, mine was two days after. 
He had forgotten and we had an argument, he apologised and asked for another chance I said yes because I wanted to believe that this man did actually care about me.

Eventually, he starts ignoring me when I felt depressed and anxious, he started comparing me with a woman who he swore he didn‚Äôt like that much, he would do this after being intimate with each other. 
I asked to break up and he agrees and I take the opportunity to just tell him everything because I was never going to speak to him again after the phone went down, I hated the way he made me feel. 

I was crying on the phone and I knew we‚Äôre done but I begged to do the bare minimum and he said he couldn‚Äôt do it. He asked me to stay on the phone while I was crying and he started saying that I am enough and I was a good girlfriend. 

Once I said I know I‚Äôm good enough and this hasn‚Äôt affected my self esteem he got nasty and couldn‚Äôt wait to hang up the phone. I gave him back his stuff including a necklace he gave me the first time we were intimate and he took said it was an awful necklace and he was going to throw it in the trash. I stood up, took my stuff and said goodbye with my head held high.

This was obviously not fantastic but then I thought back on how he would make comments about how I eat, how I‚Äôm heavy or how I‚Äôm too muscular. I lost 20lbs being with him because I couldn‚Äôt eat near him and when I was away I felt nauseous. He would be nice a lot of the time but he had a snide remark whenever he knew I was going to be away from him. His favourite photo of me was when he made me cry for two hours straight and then I had to get dolled up for dinner. 

There is more stuff about our times being intimate and how he wasn‚Äôt always the nicest but it was consensual, just not fun or romantic.

I apologise if I am being dramatic and I most likely wasn‚Äôt in an abusive relationship but so many people in my life would ask questions about my relationship that teeter on asking whether he ever hurt me. 

Edit: Thank you all for responding so quickly and so kindly. I haven‚Äôt really spoken in detail about the breakup as it only happened two days ago and I was afraid that I would come across like a scorned ex. I knew something was wrong when I visited my friend yesterday. They live about 20 minutes from his home, I started to dry heave and panic even though I knew he was in work because I was so afraid of him just seeing me."

And it's making me even more confused and guilty. Especially as I viewed a flat this week and planning to leave soon.  I'm so so confused like have I got all that's happened wrong? Or has he finally realised what he was doing and as changed himself permanently?  I have told him loads of times about things he as been doing and it gets denied/speaks over me etc.. and he doesn't do anything or say sorry or blames me. So that's even more confusing because he's saying to talk to him and tell him things that are bothering me with him/relationship etc.... "
1jbtazk,I discovered more..,Lavendarr2826,3,2025-03-15 11:44:39+00:00,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbtazk/i_discovered_more/,"I just need to talk. Keeping everything to myself is exhausting. I can‚Äôt talk to him about it‚Äîhe always becomes hostile, aggressive, and somehow turns it all back on me. It‚Äôs like clockwork. And with the kids here, I don‚Äôt want them to see him like that.

The other day, I calmly asked if he told his parents something personal about me. I always approach these things with an open mind, trying to be fair. Most of the time, I already know the answer‚ÄîI just want to give him the chance to be honest. I need him to be honest. There was a time I literally begged on my knees, sobbing on the couch while he walked past me without a shred of remorse. I even wrote him the most heartfelt letter, hoping to get through to him. Total failure. His response? Dismissive, rude, full of denial. I couldn‚Äôt even finish reading the letter he wrote back.

Anyway, back to the other day. I asked him, and as expected, he lied. I put my feelings aside and reassured him that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal‚ÄîI just wanted to know what they knew, since I‚Äôd be seeing them soon. But he kept lying. And then, like always, he got angry. His favorite line: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done nothing wrong. I‚Äôm not lying. You need to accept that.‚Äù I even tried to minimize it so he wouldn‚Äôt feel so defensive, but it was useless. Eventually, I let it go. He‚Äôs exhausting. Maybe that‚Äôs what he wants‚Äîme, weak.

Later, at the hospital visiting my dad, I don‚Äôt remember exactly how it came up again. Maybe he asked why I was upset, and I probably just said something like, ‚ÄúI give up. I just wish you‚Äôd be honest with me.‚Äù As we walked to the elevators, his tone shifted, that familiar edge creeping in. I told him to calm down. In the elevator, I finally just repeated back a snippet of the exact conversation he had with his mom. He stopped mid-sentence.

Then, just the other day, I asked about his sobriety. He‚Äôs a porn addict‚Äîa sex addict, really. That‚Äôs a whole other story about how I got caught up with him in the first place. He‚Äôs never actually been sober. I told him I knew he wasn‚Äôt doing well. I didn‚Äôt even bring up everything else, just the porn. He still lied. He got aggressive, started yelling, slammed the car door on me, then drove off.

Later, he admitted he got ‚Äúheated‚Äù because he doesn‚Äôt like feeling backed into a corner. Finally, he admitted he hadn‚Äôt been doing well. But by the end of the day, the same cycle repeated‚Äîdenial, defensiveness. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done nothing wrong.‚Äù He‚Äôs never done anything wrong, according to him. It‚Äôs all nonsense, apparently.

The frustrating part? I see his patterns. I recognize the abuse. He knows I do‚Äîthat‚Äôs why he shuts down and repeats his rehearsed lines instead of addressing anything.

I don‚Äôt even know why I put myself through this cycle. I know he won‚Äôt tell me the truth. He‚Äôs even gone as far as accusing me of planting evidence when I confront him. And yet, there‚Äôs this part of me that still hopes‚Äîhopes he‚Äôll show me that he loves me, that he cares. It‚Äôs pathetic, really.

It‚Äôs heartbreaking to know so much and have to keep it in, because if I don‚Äôt, he‚Äôll emotionally abuse me. He‚Äôs called me crazy.

Someone who claims to love you shouldn‚Äôt make you question your own reality just so they can continue lying. I say ‚Äúattempt‚Äù because I know too much for him to gaslight me fully‚Äîbut it‚Äôs still so, so wrong. How can someone do this to another human being, let alone their partner?

The worst part? The mindfuck of it all. Because he can be loving, sweet. We have fun together. But I understand now‚Äîit‚Äôs not enough. And it never will be.

And the projection? That‚Äôs the kicker. Anything I call him out on‚Äîhis emotional abuse, gaslighting, manipulation‚Äîhe throws it all back at me in the next argument, word for word, but in the wrong context. It‚Äôs exhausting.

And now, I‚Äôve discovered more. I know who two of the other women are. Oh right, yesterday when he came out of the shower, he had scratches on his neck and shoulders. I‚Äôll post photos. I don‚Äôt know, maybe he loves her. 

I wish he loved me. But I strongly believe the cheating excites him. It‚Äôs all he ever reads about. 

How could I be so stupid? How do I still love this man? I love him so deeply, and it hurts that I‚Äôm not enough. Why are you with me? Why are you doing this to me? How can you say you love someone while being the one to put the knife in their back? You are fucking killing me. How can you not feel any remorse? I‚Äôm literally shaking in tears. I don‚Äôt even know who he is, but I wish he would prove that he cared. God this hurts so much. 

We had a daughter together, and I gave her the worst man to look up to. I just hope with all my heart she never ends up with someone like him.

If anyone wants to read our messages or the letter I wrote him, I‚Äôll share.


I‚Äôll have to make a new post to show photos as I can‚Äôt add them with the edit "
1jbrqz8,Attorney Recommendations in Georgia,chelsbellsatl,2,2025-03-15 09:56:10+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbrqz8/attorney_recommendations_in_georgia/,"I'm currently separated from my abusive spouse. Before we split, he was incredibly emotionally, financially, and verbally abusive. He controlled all of our finances and frequently threatened to cut me off and/or sell everything and disappear. After a series of incidents that eventually escalated and became public, we split in July and have been living separately since. 

Before we split, he had me sign and notarize a separation agreement in which we divided assets (he controlled all finances, and did the analysis of our wealth) and he agreed to pay $1000/mo in alimony for 4 years. The intent was to file pro se, and wrap things up quickly, both to protect his reputation and our mutual financial well being. 

As you might expect, the abusive partner never filed. Now, he doesn't want to pay alimony and is doing everything in his power to lose his job and drain his assets before we get the divorce going. I've filed for a TPO to stop him from draining assets (and harassing me, an ongoing issue) but it hasn't been served to him yet as he's hiding at his new girlfriend's house and I don't have the address. 

I'm able to survive off of what we divided already, but will need the alimony to obtain health insurance as it isn't offered through my position. I make like 1/10th of what my spouse does, and have no assets to fall back on. (He owns a 400k+ house, a Tesla M3, etc) 

I am desperately seeking an affordable divorce attorney in DeKalb County, Georgia who can help me with this case. I need representation both for the divorce and the TPO. I'm also considering a defamation suit, which would need to be filed soon to stay within the one year SOL. Any recommendations?"

1jbpjy5,Services That Transcribe Recordings,OurWitch,1,2025-03-15 07:08:45+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbpjy5/services_that_transcribe_recordings/,"Has anyone tried new AI transcribing services for recordings of abuse? I tried one tonight and it was so positive that I immediately thought it would be good for so many victims.

The only issue I can see is that it transcribes the abuse and then it links to ChatGPT to give an analysis. In my case that was so very positive. You constantly worry that you are overreacting or did something wrong so it was nice to see ChatGPT say positive things when it was a ""neutral"" party.

The problem I can potentially see is that it might be negative to an abused person without proper context or that it may end up being too ""understanding"" of an abuser. In general AI can sometimes present a person in the best light and I am afraid it might do it for someones abuser. In my case it was overall fairly negative to my abuser but I could see that not being the case for every recording. I'm going to include a small section that only reveals general information about my situation:

""Later, after the storm calms and the mother exits the conversation, the father steps in as a source of comfort. He reassures his children that they are loved, regardless of the tensions between the adults in their lives. His presence becomes a soft landing for their confusion and sadness. Through small rituals‚Äîa handshake, a hug, a shared bedtime routine‚Äîhe restores a sense of connection and safety.

# What This Teaches Us About Family Dynamics

1. **Pain and Compassion Often Coexist** Parents can be hurting, and in their pain, they may say things they don‚Äôt mean. They may lash out or fail to see the struggles of their partners. But families that hold space for compassion‚Äîespecially when voiced by children‚Äîcan offer opportunities for healing.
2. **Children Are Active Participants in Family Narratives** Children notice more than we think. They interpret, advocate, and try to make sense of the dynamics around them. Their perspectives can offer clarity and sometimes a deeper wisdom, as the child demonstrates in this exchange.
3. **Emotional Safety is Essential** Even amid conflict, it‚Äôs possible to create moments of safety and reassurance. The father‚Äôs tender words and actions toward his children are a testament to the role of emotional security in navigating family challenges.
4. **Words Matter** Language shapes the emotional landscape of a home. Harsh words leave lasting impressions, especially on young minds. But kind, affirming language can be just as powerful in healing wounds and reinforcing bonds."

In January my husband repeatedly raped me over the course of a month. I have had a very hard time dealing with this, having panic attacks almost daily and dissociating so much I have been losing time. He has since been acting like nothing happened. I ended up leaving for 9 days because my anxiety was so bad I felt I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. 

I ended up going back 3 days ago after he called, acknowledged what he did and said he wants to work on the marriage. I also felt very guilty about his emotional state. When I came back we had a long discussion, in which I asked him why he would do something that he knew he could go back to prison for if I reported him. He told me if I called the police he would just kill himself. 

I told him that I am afraid of him, and that I am 99 percent sure he would never kill me, but there is still 1 percent. I asked if he knew what it felt like to not be 100 percent sure your partner would kill you. He said ""actually, yes. I've always been afraid might try to kill me if I left you"". I immediately broke down in tears because I could never hurt him, and have given him no reason to think I would. He also told me he has been paranoid for months I might use one of his combat knives to kill him in his sleep. This seemed like a really bizarre thing to say, because, again, I am not a violent person at all.  Now I am wondering if maybe he is setting up some kind of defense? It was such a violent image, and he does have a combat knife in our bedroom. Am I right to be concerned about this? "

He was gone before they came and they're looking for him now. I'm so happy I had the strength to walk away 2 years ago, but I thought he found another me and left me in peace. He looked so disgusting, just repulsive, much older, with black evil eyes. I just wish even after 2 years I shouldn't have been so relaxed about the door, I must always remain cautious. And I wish I hid my phone. I'm just grateful we survived this. But why. It's crazy what a human can do to another human. Why are you still trying to torture me? You want me to suffer. You think that will make me...erm... Like you again? Love you? Take you back? Crazy. Never. I was dumb 2 years ago still hoping ""he will change"". I remember the very first incident, a policewoman said ""look girl, I'm telling you now and you will mention my words-he will never ever change, you need to start the healing process now"". God, I wish I had my eyes open then. I know I'm his property and he wants control, but can you just finally get a life and left me be?"

I unblocked him. Then felt stressed almost immediately. Feeling tension in my forehead. It's the first time I've noticed I have those intensely stressed reactions and he wasn't even phsycially around. 

I needed something external (a notification) wake me up from that moment and then I re-blocked him. Felt much better straight away.

I've been hesitant to post here because I'm not sure that my situation is nearly the same as the horrible things that other people here go through. I couldn't find another subreddit that seemed to fit what I want to talk about and I don't really have anyone I trust to speak to about this with. 

My partner and I have only started being intimate recently, but I've encountered a problem with it; They wont stop hurting me. They like to bite me, really hard. it leaves bruises on me, especially in my throat area. It makes it hard to swallow and move around properly and I don't like the way it looks. I've told them i dont want them to do it but they do anyways. after i flinched away really badly one time they suggested that we do a test where they bite me harder and harder until i cant take it so that they can know how hard to bite. I said no i really don't want to do that but they kept asking and i said no. I was really scared of them for the first time ever im not really sure why. but they are bigger than me and were on top of me and then they kind of did it anyway. they didn't outright say it but they bit me a few more times harder and harder until i flinched again then they didn't go harder. they also did it on other parts of me that are swollen and sore now. my flinching seems to just encourage them to keep going

why are they so insistent on biting me to this point? i don't know a lot about sex or like less vanilla stuff. is it normal for biting to reach this point? I could probably learn to get over it but it ended up really bad and it was like i wasn't even in my own body anymore. sometimes i enjoy being intimate when it doesn't hurt but 98% of the time im just thinking about anything else or thinking about when it will be over. am i just inexperienced in this sort of thing? I know some people enjoy being bitten and all that but this feels really extreme and not... right"

I asked to take my break and when I got back from my break he seemed to have left. He never spoke to me and I avoided him as much as possible. 

A day after that, I found out he unblocked me. If he hates me as much as he says he does, if he plays the victim so hard, why did he unblock me? I still have him blocked so he can't message me, but I am scared. It makes me so uncomfortable that he is thinking about me. I don't want to talk to him. i don't want to see him.

For a year I wanted an apology, an acknowledgment of the pain he caused me. Now I just want to be left alone. I'm trying to be happy again. So why unblock me? Why do that when he has a girlfriend, when he makes songs about how horrible I am?

I am still scared of him finding me again. I don't ever want to be where I was when I was with him. I still deal with PTSD all the time. I never want to see him again. I hate him."

and to be fair I did make mistakes and the most valuable lesson I learned from this experience was that even though the intentions were never pure, my eyes were opened to behaviors I could improve upon.

I don't know if I can ever truly trust anyone ever again. She broke me. She used me.

he kept scolding me going on and on when we were both happy talking right before that. i was telling him how excited i was to meet up and he was excited to take me on a date. but i hung up because i'm on my lunch break, i don't have time for drama and i'm in a good mood. so he goes crazy over text. why does he sabotage everything?

i'm not going to meet up with him now. i've done this too many times before, i just haven't had sex in 8 months and know it's so good with him. sad he can't keep up the nice act for even a week"

He is also a recovering alcoholic. He has a big relapse about every 6 months and usually this means getting drunk at 7am when he gets home. 
This morning I woke up and it‚Äôs our youngest child and he was unresponsive on the couch. I thought I had to call an ambulance at first before he finally started slurring his words but he was being aggressive. 
He was telling me to shut up and leave him alone and I assumed he was drunk and told my daughter we were going to get dressed and leave because I didn‚Äôt want her seeing him drunk. As I walked past him he shot up and starting shoving me and shaking me. I begged him to let go and he just started screaming about how much he hates me and I should grateful and he threw my phone across the room when I tried calling my dad. 
My parents are helping me. I am safe. But now twelve hours later he‚Äôs talking about admitting himself to a mental hospital because he doesn‚Äôt remember any of it happening and he offered to move out. He woke up at 5pm completely normal. He swears he didn‚Äôt drink anything at all and that the last thing he remembers is sitting down on the couch to read. He‚Äôs gotten aggressive before, every time he drinks. But he‚Äôs never laid a hand on me. 
Not asking for anyone to say it seems like any kind diagnosis. Just wondering if anyone has ever heard of something like this or if he‚Äôs just gaslighting me into thinking he didn‚Äôt mean any of it. "

!!!I am safely out of this relationship.!!!


I dated a bloke who had autism. However for four years he insisted that I had borderline personality disorder. Is this normal for an autistic person to blame someone for having borderline personality disorder when relationships take work?. 

Even when we argued (as most people do in relationships as they are not perfect!!) he‚Äôd accuse me of having borderline personality disorder because I was assertive and confident. I stood my ground and called him out when he was unfair. I too have flaws but I don‚Äôt angrily say my partner has borderline personality disorder when things don‚Äôt go well. 

He is just a past relationship with no verified credentials to dish out the complex nature of borderline personality disorder or personality disorders for that matter. 

How do I overcome this toxic relationship. Yes it‚Äôs over. 

I‚Äôm in therapy but I just need some support and additional support. 

How did you handle your boyfriend or girlfriend constantly attacking your character and saying that you had borderline personality disorder.?"

I‚Äôm sure this comes down to them actually just being insecure and not liking themselves. I have a hard time trying to console them when they‚Äôre self loathing, and obviously don‚Äôt like being talked down to when they‚Äôre acting better than me.

This is because my father is also an abuser. No one knew about me getting a housing voucher. I have an appointment this Tuesday, I told all of them that it was an appointment for my son for us to continue to get WIC. My dad overheard me speaking to my potential case manager, confirming for Tuesday. He asked me about it, and I told him that I had to go in just for the appointment because if I don‚Äôt that they would take the food stamps away. He said, ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter, I will take care of you and the baby.‚Äù Yet, he has stopped financially supporting me after he got physically abusive with me back in January. I told him that I think it‚Äôs best that I could go, because they could also take our health insurance. He told me that if I go for the appointment, and they give me a voucher, and I accepted, That my son will be taken from me. And I‚Äôm completely appalled.

Since the day I gave birth to him. Motherhood is not easy but I have never hurt my son or thought about hurting him.

I have not tried to unalive myself Since I was 21, I‚Äôm 29 now, and I have not self harmed in‚Ä¶ this year makes six years. Everyone in my environment always turns around and talks about my mental health, as if I‚Äôm still that 19 year-old girl having the hardest time of her life. My experiences are a lot more difficult, but my headspace is a lot better. And it stresses me out when they tell me that my son will be taken from me. And I‚Äôm trying to tell myself, that it‚Äôs not true. Why would they take my son? What grounds do they have to take him? None! My son is healthy, he is safe, and he‚Äôs more than OK! So I don‚Äôt know why they keep on trying to give me anxiety behind being independent, But then want me to have it all figured out! And again, I‚Äôm just trying to remind myself that this is what abusers do. When they feel like they cannot control you, they scare you. They try to scare you back into your box, so they know that you‚Äôre able to be controlled than that box. I‚Äôm just so sad, I‚Äôm sad that strangers on the Internet that I‚Äôve never met support me more than the people who I shared DNA with, the people who watch me grow up. I‚Äôm upset that there‚Äôs not one tangible person that I can rely on.

1jbdojr,Am I being abused?,CourageQueasy4111,2,2025-03-14 20:36:53+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbdojr/am_i_being_abused/,"So, it's a long story. We met when I was 19 and he was 21, and we've been together for eight years. We pretty much built our adult lives together and grew up alongside each other.

When we first met, he didn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship, but I stuck around because I really liked him‚Äîand, honestly, because I had messed-up self-esteem¬†*lol.*¬†Things weren‚Äôt all bad, but he often insulted me, calling me names during arguments‚Äîwords like¬†*""stupid,""*¬†*""retarded,""*¬†*""a bitch,""*¬†etc. As I‚Äôve said, I never had high self-esteem, so I believed him. I internalized the idea that¬†*I‚Äôm not that smart or bright,*¬†and over the years, it really undermined my confidence. Even now, I still doubt my own intelligence.

I used to cry a lot and let him know that what he was doing was hurting me. He would apologize, but the behavior always repeated.

Then, about 3.5 to 4 years into our relationship, I went to therapy for completely unrelated reasons. I had developed pretty bad anxiety and had also lost all sexual desire, so I decided to seek help. My therapist never told me I was being abused or even suggested it, but she did tell me to establish boundaries‚Äîand I did. One day, I kind of blew up and told him,¬†*""I don't even know if I love you anymore. I can't stand living like this.""*¬†It was a huge shock for him. He promised he would work on himself and change.

I was happy to hear that, but, honestly, I had already built up a lot of resentment and couldn't let go of the past. So, even after about six months of my boyfriend (now husband) being nice to me, my sexual desire didn‚Äôt return, and eventually, he stopped trying. I understood his frustration and the pain of feeling emotionally rejected, but I couldn‚Äôt force my desire to come back.

We ended up getting married for legal reasons, but at the time, it felt like the natural next step because our relationship¬†**wasn‚Äôt that bad**¬†back then. However, after getting married, my anxiety skyrocketed. I also started struggling with eating in public (don‚Äôt even ask, it‚Äôs horrible). That‚Äôs how a few years passed‚Äî**a dead bedroom, a lack of emotional** and physical **connection, and mostly arguments**‚Äîwhere, at least from my perspective, he disrespected me (he says I disrespected him).

Fast forward to now: It‚Äôs been a year since I quit a job I hated to focus on my own projects, while he has been financially providing for us. I appreciate him for that, and I do take care of our apartment and our dog‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt cook because I hate it (though according to him, that‚Äôs not even the biggest issue). Unfortunately, after a year of working on multiple projects, none of them have been successful yet. I‚Äôm not sure if they ever will be, but I‚Äôm not losing hope.

Recently, we've been having¬†**lots**¬†of arguments because:

1. **He resents me**¬†for not contributing my ‚Äúfair share‚Äù to the relationship.
2. **I resent him**¬†for constantly putting me down and emotionally neglecting me.

# Some Things He Has Said to Me:

* During an argument about budgeting, I pushed back, and he said: **""You better start with, 'Okay, let‚Äôs see if we can make it work,' not all that other bullshit you give me. Anything having to do with money‚Äîas far as I‚Äôm concerned‚Äîyou have way less say than I do.""**
* **""You‚Äôve gotten way more out of this relationship than I have, just because I work and you don‚Äôt.""**
* **""Nobody has a better setup than you. Nobody lives a life as nice as yours.""**

I offered therapy because I honestly don‚Äôt believe we can fix this without professional help. He said he¬†**doesn‚Äôt need therapy and doesn‚Äôt want it.**¬†After I brought it up again and he said no, I told him that he was shutting me down. His reply:

* **""What‚Äôs wrong with you? What‚Äôs your problem? Get your shit together. Get your fucking shit together. You‚Äôre such a fucking weirdo. Just stop being such an odd person. Just hear yourself. Don‚Äôt you understand that this isn‚Äôt even likable?""**
* **""Your videos (I have a YouTube channel) probably aren‚Äôt working because you‚Äôre so cringe. You can‚Äôt even do the videos with me in the house‚Äîyou‚Äôre probably so cringe.""**¬†(When I told him this was disrespectful, he said it was¬†*honest*.)
* **""Just look at yourself, just look at yourself. Who the hell would want you? Honestly, the only reason I stay with you is because I‚Äôve known you for so long. I‚Äôve loved you, you know, but like, in your state, as of right now‚Äîsomebody brand new? No sex, not getting anything done, not cooking, not caring?""**"

But I just couldn‚Äôt anymore and as a survivor a 10 year old highly abusive  relationship I knew and could see all the signs. 

I‚Äôm looking for someone to tell me I did the right thing (I left during love bombing so really just as devaluation started but because of that, things hadn‚Äôt gotten really bad yet which makes it harder‚Ä¶)

These are the issues I noted:

- aggressively love bombed me told me he loved me the first week we met (and made soulmate declarations) and was literally talking about marriage and moving in within days of us meeting. 
- he hid it at first but I realized that he is a major alcoholic. Drinks often right when he wakes up. His version of cutting him back on drinking was to have 3-4 drinks a day. 
- I noticed major triangulation issues involving him talking about other women being attracted to him, I assume to make me jealous or insecure. The last straw for me was being out with him when he basically ignored me and chatted with a bartender and later mentioned that he thought she was someone ‚Äúhe would be dating if he wasn‚Äôt dating someone else‚Äù. 
- there were numerous instances of me noticing inconsistencies in things he said over time. Probably, related to the alcohol but there might be more there. (Ex: Told me a long and detailed story about recently going to a restaurant with his ex wife to deal with some paperwork / legal docs related to his divorce and how she kept trying to kiss him and he turned down her advances. When I mentioned the restaurant later on again he said ‚Äúhe had never been there‚Äù) 
- all of his exes are ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù and abusive to him 
- he is currently being investigated by hr for pursuing a subordinate at work (this is an attractive, younger woman who rejected him and he still stays ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with and really ‚Äúwanted me to meet‚Äù which all seemed kind of weird to me if I‚Äôm being honest- also reeked of triangulation to me)
- physically assaulted his ex (he‚Äôs a big dude and she‚Äôs a small woman) because she was abusive to him. He has been married twice and claims both exes were abusive to him. 

There‚Äôs even more examples of weird shit that has raised my alarm bells over the past few weeks and I finally pulled the plug yesterday and have been shocked at how cold he‚Äôs been. He went from ‚ÄúI love you so much‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live without you‚Äù to dropped my stuff off and not even arguing with me to stay and as much as I know this is a blessing and I needed to do this, it hurts. 

I guess I‚Äôm looking for reassurance that I did the right thing (cognitively I know I did, but emotionally is different)

We have 3 boys ages 5, 3, and 6 months. We have a house that we fully own, I‚Äôm a SAHM, and my husband makes decent money at his job. My husband is almost 32 and I am 36. 

My husband, for as long as we have been together, has had a horrible money spending and lying habit. He hides it like an addiction and always ALWAYS gets caught. We have argued about this every 3-6 months for the past 6ish years. We have a joint account that he doesn‚Äôt spend, but he has a personal account that he puts $800/month into. It ALL goes towards food, video game garbage (he plays for an hour or so after everyone goes to bed), and supplements like greens and pre workout. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other crap, but from what I‚Äôve seen, $20/day goes to takeout at work. I had tried to get him to bring lunch but he never tells me when he needs more lunch ‚Äúsupplies‚Äù. Over the years, he racked up over $20k in debt and his parents bailed him out of $17k of it. This is just a short, tip of the iceberg version. 

We have fought dozens of times about his spending and lying. He goes to therapy a few times after each argument and then goes right back to his habits. I finally caved and told his parents absolutely everything he does/has done. I will honestly say that I told them in hopes of him losing an ally because he was never fully honest with them. Our previous discussion about this was really good and I felt like he was going to change. Now, we are under the same roof and barely speaking. 

Do we try marriage counseling? Kids complicate this much more. I would stay together for the kids if that meant we can get past this. But I want them to know what a healthy relationship looks like and we are anything but that right now. I need to hear stories of hope and experience. He‚Äôs not a bad person, is great with the kids, and you would never guess he would have these skeletons in his closet. But I can‚Äôt live like this anymore. We were so madly in love, but every lie has stolen more and more of that from us.

1jbaujn,I hope you see this.,Complete-Horror-3420,6,2025-03-14 18:37:17+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbaujn/i_hope_you_see_this/,"I used to have another reddit account that i‚Äôve since deleted, but i‚Äôve made this new one as a throw away. On my old account, I made a few posts after breaking up with my abusive ex, he found it and gave advice acting as if he was another person. Shit like ‚Äúoh maybe he need another chance you should forgive him‚Äù ‚Äúoh maybe he need mental help, you should be there and support him‚Äù his exact words since he couldn‚Äôt speak english fluently. After blocking him on all social media and forgetting about that account for months, he messages me on there almost a year after our break up, i get the email notification and immediately delete the account without reading what he says. Because i don‚Äôt want to ever hear or read a word that comes out of his mouth. 

Anyways. I‚Äôm here to rant, because i want to move on, but i know i won‚Äôt be able to without getting all of this shit off my chest. 

I think about how he used to want to be on facetime 24/7. If i wanted to play on my computer he‚Äôd get upset, if i wanted to watch tv or draw, i couldn‚Äôt if i wanted to crochet, i couldn‚Äôt, ALL because my attention wasn‚Äôt on him. The only time he let me crochet while i was talking to him was because i was making HIM a blanket. I said i was shocked he let me crochet while we were on facetime and he said ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre making that for me‚Äù. If i wasn‚Äôt doing something for him or giving him attention, he got so ANGRY. 

When we would watch movies over call, he‚Äôd make me watch on my pc while I had my phone camera pointed at my face so he could make sure that i‚Äôm watching the movie. If i looked away from the screen at all he‚Äôd end the movie and start yelling at me. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing why aren‚Äôt you watching the movie‚Äù ‚Äútell me why you weren‚Äôt watching the movie‚Äù over and over and over again for hours until i gave an answer that he was satisfied with. 

A lot of times I‚Äôd give an honest answer to something he was angry about, but if it didn‚Äôt match with the reason he had in his head he‚Äôd go ballistic and would yell and argue until i just ended up agreeing with his answer instead, just to end the yelling. He was breaking down my spirit. 

Once when i got very sick, he wanted me to come over and kept persisting so i gave in. He got so angry over  that i didn‚Äôt want to have sex with him, and that‚Äôs I was sleeping too much. Once I ended up getting a UTI, and he got SO PISSED at me for ‚Äúnot taking care of myself or keeping myself clean‚Äù and was yelling at me for an hour before i had to send him multiple articles saying that women can get UTI‚Äôs from literally anything. 

He‚Äôd start so many fights about SUCH CHILDISH SHIT. He went through my reposts on tiktok, found a video about SHIRTLESS GOJO that i had reposted SIX MONTHS BEFORE i had even met him. He got really pissed about it and i had to sit there sobbing while he yelled at me.  Im sure so many of you know the feeling, being yelled at over and over and over, them repeating the same argument. over. and over. and over. until you‚Äôre just sitting there wanting to claw off your own skin out of anger and frustration. 
 
He also borrowed my switch lite and then ended up selling it and tried to act like he still had it. Had to fully confront him about it before he admitted it. He gave  the excuse of ‚Äúoh i didn‚Äôt think you really used it, i was also going to let you use mine instead‚Äù might i point out ‚ÄúUSE‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúGIVE‚Äù. If he had given me his switch or the money it wouldn‚Äôt have been so upsetting. 

Before we broke up, i had brought up the word ‚ÄúVerbal abuse‚Äù to him, he went crazy and started saying that he couldn‚Äôt have possibly abused me because i was the one making him sad and angry, and how he was the one taking care of me and buying stuff for me. Oh yes, the abuse just doesn‚Äôt exist because he bought a couple meals for me apparently!

When I sent him article after article, video after video of every sigh of emotional and verbal abuse, it was so obvious that even he had admitted it. We broke up, i posted to reddit seeking help, and that‚Äôs when he did what i said above. Pretended to be someone else and get me to go back to him. Even signed off his message with ‚Äúsending hugs‚Äù the thought makes me want to puke. 

I really hope he sees this. I hope he sees this and a pit of sorrow and regret fills his stomach. 
If you see this, do NOT show up to my house, i WILL call the police and file a restraining order. Do NOT message me or comment on hers, I WILL OPENLY call you out.

1jbamhy,How to get over to an abusive relationship ( physically abusive boyfriend),nixiiie,2,2025-03-14 18:28:01+00:00,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbamhy/how_to_get_over_to_an_abusive_relationship/,"We broke up just yesterday after he hit me again, weve been together for almost 3 years and he has been physically abusive to me since i think he got some anger management issues and most of the time he's taking it out on me. Yesterday was my last straw, i dont have any problem breaking up with him i just want it to stay that way. I want to forget everything and just move on . But how can you move on from someone you gave your best to, how can you move on from a life that you once had with them? Please help me thru it "
1jba6lp,i think my abuser truly believes he is the victim,Sea_Strength_533,27,2025-03-14 18:02:41+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jba6lp/i_think_my_abuser_truly_believes_he_is_the_victim/,"TW sexual violence

so, the idea of me ‚Äúmaking him like this‚Äù has been a common theme in our relationship. he basically says i was mentally unstable since the beginning and i pushed him this far, and that i am actually the abusive one. this has always been confusing for me because i was mentally unstable when we got together, and i actually did hit him first, so he‚Äôs always been able to use that against me. he fails to remember that i hit him because for months of me crying for him to stop looking at other women online, he just laughed in my face and called me crazy over and over. 

anyways, i really truly do believe that he believes he is a victim, in his own fucked up brain. he sees himself as a good person, and i‚Äôm the abuser. even after berating me, calling me every name in the book, cheating on me multiple times, strangling me multiple times, threatening to rape me for months, and finally sexually assaulting me while i literally screamed and cried and begged him to stop‚Ä¶. he still somehow manages to play the victim. he even went so far to say that i raped him at the beginning of the relationship, 7 years ago. i do remember this instance, we had rough sex and i was the aggressor instead of him, but it always seemed consensual, and it was never brought up until literally 24 hours after he assaulted me. so somehow i was the bad guy again and i ‚Äúruined sex‚Äù for him. but he didnt start getting rapey until about 4 months ago. it‚Äôs so confusing. i left almost 6 weeks ago, and now he is discarding me. part of me is grateful because i wasnt strong enough to go no contact myself, but another part of me is heartbroken. i wish he could see the pain and trauma he has caused me. 

edit: yes, i‚Äôve read the book. he‚Äôs definitely The Water Torturer and The Victim. intellectualizing it doesnt help how shitty and confused i feel right now though üò™"
1jb93of,I‚Äôm so tired,Chaos_Foxxx,7,2025-03-14 17:15:02+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jb93of/im_so_tired/,I left my abusive relationship almost two years ago but I still shake when I burn food or make a loud noise. I still cry when my partner talks loudly even if he‚Äôs just excited. I still worry about my pets when they chew something up. I still have panic attacks when I drop something or lose something. I still can‚Äôt catch my breath at the grocery store‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm so tired and the worst part is sometimes I miss him.

He‚Äôs financially abusive, physical and mentally abusive. I‚Äôm so sick right now that I can‚Äôt even walk I‚Äôm severely dehydrated. I‚Äôve considered going to the hospital. He‚Äôs treating me even worse right now. Bitching about the house and telling me I have to get it together today to do some laundry. He sucks at taking care of the kids and they have completely destroyed the house because he just plays his video game or phone. I hate him so much I wish he would die. "
1jb8tsg,Im being abused but can't admit it to myself,,7,2025-03-14 17:03:46+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jb8tsg/im_being_abused_but_cant_admit_it_to_myself/,My step father I've known him for about 10 years he's always been very angry and yells at the slightest mistake when he yells I can't talk back if I do I fear that I'll be hit or worse he always apologises but that more seems like he does it so he can keep me attached he never really let's me out of the house or when I do he must know where I'm going im 20 but I still fear him deeply I have younger siblings so as the eldest I feel trapped I want to escape but can't abandon my siblings

i. i'm hurt and angry and sad and embarrassed and numb but i find myself thinking that if he broke the no contact order i would give in. i would beg him for forgiveness and apologize and let him hit me again just to feel his touch and i would take all the blame just to hear him say he forgives me and that he loves me again

i know it just takes time. i just want to stop feeling like this. i wish i could just hate him"
