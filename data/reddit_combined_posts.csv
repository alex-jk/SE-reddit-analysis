1jcsdmi,Kids afraid of adults,Careful-Physics-7578,1,2025-03-16 18:40:48+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jcsdmi/kids_afraid_of_adults/,"We are currently away from my husband, in the early stage of divorce, with restraining order in effect. I am aiming to have majority of custody of our 2 kids. Restraint order is for coercive control, rough handling of kids, severe yelling/berating of kids. Recently my 4 year old has been showing fear of other caregivers, including me and my mother. We however are not abusive with him. He recently told me to be nice to his little sibling. and that I was scaring his sibling, he was afraid I would hurt him. Another time my mother went to take a toy from the toddler, because he was being rough with it. 4 year old ran, as if to protect my toddler, and grabbed my mother’s hands. 
To me, he has learned to be afraid of caregivers. On top of how I want him to feel safe and secure, I am worried he will express these fears to a parenting evaluator. Has anyone experienced this? Of course I reiterate to him that I would never hurt him or his sibling, and I’m hoping over time, and away from his dad, he will feel safer. I can’t help but be worried dad has created problems that will actually work against us, despite me efforts to keep everyone safe. ",,,

In October 2024 we got into an argument, he went to slap me but I pulled back. He destroyed the room broke all work computers and the TV. Said he’ll never do that! Dec 2024 he was drinking , I said something to upset him he spit on me , threw stuff out of the house , grabbed me like in a choke hold claims bc I was going to hit him. Never have I attempted to hit him , I’m very or made any gesture for him to think that. 
Jan 2025 we get back and he blames the breakup bc of me. Till this day he blames me . Bc when he spit on me and kept spitting on me I did text my adult son to come , no I couldn’t call the cops. He’ll take the phone from me ,so I would walk away and text my son quickly and hide the phone. My son came and the only reason he smacked him was bc he heard from outside my bf . He wasn’t going todo anything but tell him to go. So bc of this my bf blames me , everything is my fault the breakup and why we’re not living together  or good as we should be. 

My thing is, is there a chance he’ll never do it again do they continue doing this??? He said sorry once and bc I said hey you know what you did so it’s your fault as well. Idk what to do it’s like he doesn’t take accountability. 😓 i do love him idk if I can walk away . IIwas fine in Feb when we separated and then he comes back . ",,,
1jcmj5f,what proof do I need for custody battle,Lakewater22,2,2025-03-16 14:22:36+00:00,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jcmj5f/what_proof_do_i_need_for_custody_battle/,"
I’m in Georgia. He’s also a fucking attorney. And also my boss. 

He pays me pennys. He won’t help me buy a car after mine broke. 

He doesn’t help with anything. Like we had twins and I’m so exhausted doing this nearly alone with maybe a couple hours of break on random sundays. I need alone time. Desperately. 

I could list a novel of abuses. But I don’t even want to. 

We are not married. What proof do I need to get to the court to make sure he has the least amount of contact with the kids as possible after we leave. Like I literally cannot have him with the kids alone. I do not trust him. 

One twin has 3 different meds 6x a day…. He doesn’t even know the name of the meds let alone doses or doctors. Has never tried to learn or help. Hasn’t washed a bottle or made formula. 

Our son has 11 specialists. He hasn’t been to one appt. I’m juggling this alone borrowing cars from people. 

I am so proud of myself finally ready to leave. 

He’s abusive every way but physically. And it’s gotten so extreme. I just want to run away with the kids but need to get things in order first. 

What do I need to do? I researched a women’s shelter nearby. 

Idk how I can call, pretty sure there are cameras in the house. Can probably borrow my grams car to speak with someone there. 

Crazy thing is it’s my house/rental agreement, but of course he won’t leave because “he has tenant rights”. I’m supposed to resign the lease soon and idk if I will. I’ll never find somewhere cheaper to live, but I need away from him and need him out. Sad. I love my landlord. 

Ugh. 

The only thing holding me back is him having any custody of the kids. If I knew for certain he couldn’t we’d leave everything behind right now. I guess I need to gather proof but idk what proof even. Like. Do I put cameras in my house, that’s legal in my state. 

Do I get a voice recorder, what kind??????

I feel like I should have been gathering evidence a month ago. But ugh. 

He cannot accept our son Down syndrome. The other day he told me of an intrusive thought of putting g habanero pepper on his tongue because he’s always sticking it out. Our son is 5 months old. 

I wish I had that recorded. 

I’m afraid he will harm our son. ",,,

1jclc96,looking back at my teenage relationship TW: SA,misformambo,1,2025-03-16 13:22:51+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jclc96/looking_back_at_my_teenage_relationship_tw_sa/,"he was younger than me by 1.5 years, we were in the same grade at school.  i was at one point legally an adult and he was still a minor but that doesn’t mean he didn’t or couldn’t abuse me. i think i couldn’t accept what was happening because i was the adult, i was supposed to be the more mature one, i was supposed to be able to stand up for myself. i know now that it wasn’t my fault, that what he did was not okay and not right and i did not deserve to be treated that way by anyone.

i don’t like to label people as narcissistic because of all the stigma that comes with it but i wish that at some point during the abuse i looked up signs of narcissistic abuse, that i had listened to other’s stories and experiences because when i finally did seek out those stories, i was taken aback by how textbook his behaviours were and how many other people had experienced the exact same thing i had and it made me for the first time since meeting him feel like i wasn’t on my own.

tw: sexual abuse
sometimes i have flashbacks of small things that happened and instead of feeling disgusted in myself, i feel angry. that might not seem like a step in the right directed but before now i had never let myself be angry, i had made excuses for his behaviour and made myself the bad guy because he made me believe i was.

there were points where the name calling, the public humiliation and belittlement, the constant emotional rejection and sparingly given slivers of ‘love’ would build up and i would explode. this would happen every month or so, where i stopped being a punching bag and told him that what he was doing was wrong and it was hurting me and i didn’t deserve it. i had never been truely angry before i met this man, had never felt pure resentment and rage towards someone before. i was proud of myself for telling him how i felt but every time i did, he would play the victim and say i was abusing him by being angry at him for what he was doing to me. 

this is the part that truely disgusts me: when i didn’t cave from him playing the victim, he would quickly shift to egging me on, making me more frustrated, then he would tell me how hot i was when i was mad, how much it turned him on and how much he liked it. then we would have sex, rough sex like we were fighting and whenever he tried to initiate this i would be too disgusted with him to even remotely feel like doing that but then he’d keep pushing and pushing until i was too emotionally exhausted to stop saying no. 

i don’t even know if i was raped or if that counts as rape, because i still feel the tiniest bit at fault as i was the one in that moment being mad and yelling for once.

i later learned that this is called reactive abuse and that it was a response that he too eagerly wanted to see from me.

I now have a partner who truely loves me, who could never dream of intentionally hurting me, who apologises even when their nose accidentally pokes my eye when we kiss.

i never fully realised the toxicity of that relationship until i was given this pure care and respect by my new partner. i am so grateful i found them because they have helped me rewrite all the bad memories with good ones and that was something that therapy couldn’t do for me in the way i needed.

i hope everyone here comes to feel some sense of peace and contentment, that you find the strength to go on and that you find people who genuinely care and love you",,,
1jcjw6p,"as it turns out, major trauma has major effects",Alarmed_Worry5555,5,2025-03-16 12:00:03+00:00,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jcjw6p/as_it_turns_out_major_trauma_has_major_effects/,"i feel so isolated in everything i’ve been through. even knowing that other people have been through it, its usually straight cis women being abused by their straight male partners and it feels so deeply isolating 

im a trans gay man, my abuser was cis and …idk bi or maybe just gay. (not really sure because he said he was bi when i met him and was still with his baby mama but later started implying he was just gay. but that could’ve just been him saying that to throw me off the idea of him cheating on me with a woman.) doesn’t really matter either way ig, but it adds this whole extra layer to the abuse he put me through

whenever i started acting a way he didn’t like (like, showing emotion or asking him to give me basic aftercare, how fucking dare i) he would start saying im acting like a “female”. 
in the aftermath of strangling me he told me he “never would have put his hands on me if i was a female”

its so obvious he only saw me as half a man at best. a weaker, inferior version of a man that he could rationalize and justify taking his anger and violence and aggression out on but was still ultimately beneath him, because of my femininity.

the first two months of our relationship were spent with him hiding me from everyone in his life. partially because he was cheating on me and his baby mama at the same time, and i think also partially because he was ashamed to be seen with me. even in places where nobody knew him, nobody would recognize him, he would make me wait in the car and go into shops alone. 
eventually he did make a point of introducing me to some of his coworkers but i honestly think the only reason he did that was because he ended up breaking up with her at some point (thats a whole other can of worms i dont want to open) and was trying to like. idk prove himself to me or something. it felt like the biggest deal in the world at the time but it probably meant nothing to him. 
he never took me out on a date. not once. he promised me he would. he always swore he would. but he never did. it was never important enough to him to make the time so it never happened. or maybe he just didnt want to be bothered or didnt want to be seen with someone like me in public. 

its just so hard. especially when he made a point to always use my correct pronouns and name. as he’s getting arrested, he calls me his boyfriend to the police. i wonder sometimes if he said that because he knew my mom could hear everything from the other line of the phone call, or if that’s how he really saw me. i guess it wouldn’t make a difference either way. its so hard to feel like i’m finally seen and desired and loved for who i am just to have it all ripped away from me and it just be a facade. i thought for once someone loved me FOR ME, not in spite of me. i’m not convinced that love will ever find me. it was supposed to be him. i was supposed to be his handsome boy i was supposed to be his boyfriend, his fiancé, his husband. he told me once i was the cutest guy he’d seen in the world and he wanted to be together forever. how can you say everything i’ve ever wanted to hear from the same mouth that drips such cruelty and venom for my very identity and soul? 

i feel so alone and isolated in this experience in general, but it just compounds so much more when nobody i’ve talked to really understands or seems to care that queer and trans people get abused too 
its like we don’t matter at all
the police and courts have misgendered, disrespected and dismissed me every step of the way no matter how many times i correct them politely 
its exhausting 

i just want someone to understand what i’m going through. the severity and intensity of it all. how deeply it affected every aspect of my personhood, my identity, my life, my personality, everything. i feel like a completely different person and i’ll never be the same. and nobody understands that. 

my parents expect me to be able to act rationally, logically, patiently to emotional situations but i can’t do it anymore like i used to. it all just comes out, i have no impulse control anymore when it comes to being triggered. its like i can’t stop myself from doing or saying things. and i know a lot of it isnt exactly easy for them to deal with and my mom has been patient but its almost like they expect nothing to have changed. and its so hard to feel that pressure to act “normal” and be “normal” and over it and hold it together and patient and the strong one for everyone else when i just want everyone to be strong and patient for me for once in my life. 

i was already so tired of giving and giving and giving and giving everything i have and never receiving but i have nothing left to give anymore. he took everything from me with him when he went to jail that day and there’s nothing left of me now. its just emptiness. i have no patience or empathy or support in me to give to the people around me. i have no energy left to put on the fake mask of the perfect polite palatable trauma victim because even when i do i get dismissed, ignored and disrespected. but i have no other choice ig.

We were together a year, in which I poured myself into the relationship while I was being lied to, cheated on, verbally and physically abused. 

I’m just really struggling at the moment dealing with how unwanted and lonely I feel and while I know none of this was what I deserved, I feel guilty for staying so long. I really wished and hoped for him to change like he said he would so many times.

I poured myself into him and it’s like the more I loved him the worse he treated me.

I just want to hear from others how they got over their relationship and broke the emotional attachment because I’m really uncomfortable right now being alone and I feel extremely heart broken.
I feel like he broke a part of me and I want this feeling to end.

I would ask friends or family for advice but I have lied to them and hidden the abuse and I feel ashamed.

It makes me so sad and upset that he’s forgetting me and now I have no one. 


Repost 
I don’t know where to start. Lately, I feel disconnected from everything—numb, anxious, trapped in my own thoughts. I replay things over and over in my head, trying to make sense of them. I saw him again, and now I feel so stupid for going back.

For the first time in a long time, we spent the day together. At first, it felt familiar, almost comforting—like nothing had changed. We laughed, joked, and fell into old habits. I miss the good parts of him. He’s funny, quick-witted, magnetic. But there’s always another side lurking underneath, waiting.

As the night went on, his demeanor shifted. He started making comments, grabbing at me, saying how long it had been since he’d had sex. I brushed it off, tried to change the subject. I just wanted to be with him without it turning into something else.

By 11 p.m., I told him I needed to leave—I had driven three hours to see him, and I had a long drive home. But then he told me to take him 30 minutes away, to some random street. Said he had to use the bathroom. It didn’t make sense—there were gas stations everywhere—but I didn’t question it. Maybe he just wanted to drive, listen to music.

When we got there, it was empty in a quiet neighborhood. He led me to the restroom, looked in the mirror, flexed, checked himself out. Then he grabbed my chest over my sweatshirt and said he wanted to see.

And in that moment, I knew.

I knew I had walked right back into something where I wasn’t respected. I felt ashamed—not just for being there, but for the part of me that still wanted his attention, even though I didn’t want to be touched by him.

I told him no. He laughed, said, Just do it. And I knew—if I kept refusing, he’d get annoyed, angry. So, like before, I gave in.

It escalated. He pulled his pants down while I kept saying, We’re not having sex. He said he knew—he just wanted to “nut.” He kept pushing me to take off my pants. I kept saying no. He kept pushing. And eventually, I gave in.

He sat on the toilet, made me stand in front of him for what felt like 30 minutes, biting me, slapping me every so often. I hated it. I kept thinking, How did I end up back here?

At one point, I tried to stop. I told him it was late, that this wasn’t why I came. I told him he lied—he planned this. He just looked at me, knowing I wouldn’t leave. Then he pulled me closer, still exposed, still expecting me to keep going.

I felt trapped. If I refused, would he get angry? Would he turn on me?

Eventually, he finished. I just kept saying, What are we doing? This is so stupid. Can we go? I had a four-hour drive ahead of me, and none of this was what I wanted.

He acted surprised, like I was overreacting. Then he switched—hugging me, joking like nothing had happened.

He apologized, said he didn’t realize I’d be upset. Said he really cares about me. But it’s always the same—he frames everything as “just having fun,” but he never actually listens.

At one point, he put his hand on my neck in a sexual way—laughing, acting like it was nothing.

But it’s not nothing.

I Keep Trying to Make Sense of It. But I Can’t.

A few months ago, I ended this relationship. And now I’m realizing—I think it was abusive. But I feel so conflicted. I don’t want to ruin his life. He has nothing. No money. No stability. He clearly has mental health issues. But at the same time, I feel deeply wronged.

His family ignores what he does. When I try to talk about it, I feel gaslit—not just by him, but by them, too. It makes me feel crazy.

We were together for five years. There were good moments, but there were also times when I felt completely powerless. Things would feel fine for a while, and then something awful would happen. And then, it was like it never even happened. I started questioning my own memory.

But I know what happened.

These Are Some of the Things I Know Happened:
	One time, I was crying, and he slapped me in the face. The more I cried, the angrier he got.
	•	He pushed me into a towel rack during an argument. It dented. He was mad because I accidentally tossed his pants, and they hit his face.
	•	He tried to force me to drink shroom tea. When I refused, he shoved it toward me until it spilled, then slapped me hard, called me a “stupid bitch,” and blamed me.
	•	He stormed into my apartment once, furious that I left him at his brother’s house after drinking, even though I was trying to make sure he was safe. He threw my stuff everywhere, ripped my shirt in half off my body. My roommate had to kick him out.
	•	The first time he grabbed my neck, I was half-naked. Afterward, I had to get on a Zoom meeting, and my voice was scratchy. When I brought it up, he said I was exaggerating.
	•	In the mornings, he’d refuse to drive me to work unless we had sex. If I cried because I was tired or late, he’d call me names or threaten not to take me.
	•	During sex, if he couldn’t get aroused, he’d pinch me, pull my hair, call me degrading names. I’d cry, ask why he was mad. He’d blame me, call me a “cheater” or a “bitch.”
	•	He climbed on top of me once and hit me in the head multiple times because I accidentally hit his eye with his pants while handing them to him.
	•	He drove erratically once, pulling my hair, saying we’d both die because I talked about leaving him. I had a panic attack while he was screaming.
	•	He choked me—multiple times. Not for long, but long enough to terrify me.
	•	He wouldn’t let me go to the bathroom during sex. Wouldn’t let me stop even when I was crying. If he lost arousal, he’d pinch me, pull my hair, dig his nails into my skin.
	•	His cousin once overheard me crying naked during a fight and walked in to check. He got even angrier, blamed me for someone seeing me like that.

I hate admitting this, but I gave in to things a lot because I was afraid of what he’d do if I didn’t. When his brother was staying with us and sleeping in the same room, he’d make me have sex with him in the bathroom. It felt humiliating. But I didn’t know how to say no.

Early in our relationship, I think he did something sexual to me while I was half-asleep after getting high for the first time. I’ve tried piecing it together, but it’s vague. Later, he started demanding sex even when I was crying. Sometimes, he wouldn’t pull out—just to have control over me.

He made me feel like everything was my fault. He called me a slut, a bitch, accused me of cheating if I wanted to see friends or family. Meanwhile, he was the one cheating.

One time, neighbors called security because he was yelling, throwing me around, and I was crying. He screamed through the wall at them, calling them whores, saying he’d kill them. Afterward, he blamed me.

So Why Do I Still Feel Conflicted?

I know he has his own trauma. His own issues. A part of me still wants him to be okay. But I can’t shake how deeply wrong all of this feels.

I met my ex partner in April 2024 and we grew close very quickly. I thought he was the one. He saved me from my abusive family and him and his mother allowed me to move in with them after a horrible incident involving my cousin physically attacking both of us. My ex partner’s name is Heywood and he seemed very nice, until he showed his angry side. He was very sweet when he was in a good mood, but when angry he was a completely different person. He once drove his car recklessly while arguing with me and said if we crash it’s my fault, grabbed me by the neck multiple times, pushed me harshly to the point I flew across the hallway and blamed me for it, threatened to physically harm me and made himself look like he was going to do it just to scare and threaten me, grabbed me and held me, restricting my movement against my will, got beaten up by two guys in the middle of the night for putting his hands on me and blamed me for it happening and accused me of putting his life on the line because of it, threatened to take all my belongings from me and kick me out with absolutely nothing, and was verbally abusive and unsupportive, especially in times I was struggling with mental health and trauma. Told me to get over my trauma and the reason why I flew across the hallway in the first place was for opening up about it. He ended our relationship recently because I confronted him of continuing to follow someone on instagram who did something traumatic to me and I feel as if I was the problem. I have BPD and I understand having a borderline personality partner isn’t easy, I often got anxious and insecure in the relationship and would accuse him of not loving me and accused him of wanting to leave, but I was mostly very good to him. I did my best to be the best partner I could be, but I feel as if I was the problem because he ended the relationship this time. Am I the problem here?",,,

I already left in fear because I knew who he was. However his duality, manipulation, and lies had me thinking we were splitting amicably. 

August 5th, 2021 while I was at work, he broke into my residence and waited for me to come home from my morning shift. He beat me with a baseball bat, had zip ties and duct tape, then stabbed me in the chest with a fixed blade hunting knife. Proceeding to hold me at gunpoint. 

I talked him out of killing me by telling him a story to tell police and that we would get back together. 

I was airlifted to a hospital 2 hours away. Knife barely missed my heart and lung.

He left a note, cash, kids birth certificates etc. at his place, evident he intended murder/suicide. 

I am stuck in a loop of doom. He is in prison until we 2029 and will be 56 years old. I am convinced he will ""come for me"". But that's so far from now!

I have no mother, and I cannot talk to my father about this because he ""took the exes side"" the whole year after I filed for divorce and moved out. Didn't get to go to Thanksgiving or Christmas with my DAD for the first time in my then 40 years because of his manipulative abilities. 

My current husband was my boyfriend at the time, and the first time he met my father and my son was at the hospital the day I almost died. 

I just feel like ""my people"" are tired of me being so.... stuck. My house is generally ""not clean""... I barely cook.... like WHEN will I get out of this loop? But they also don't want to hear about it anymore and I thought maybe unloading on willing strangers might help.

1jc5l75,Approved for an apartment,ChewyChewsTheThird,5,2025-03-15 21:24:46+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jc5l75/approved_for_an_apartment/,"For a backstory, my STBX fiance has an awful temper. When anything happens in his games or with his friends, I'm always the one that has to deal with his yelling, cursing, throwing, slamming, and stomping. 

This ended up escalating when I couldn't pick him up from work one day since I was so nauseous I couldn't get out of bed. He came home angry, and when I asked him what's wrong he yelled, ""I can't feel my fucking fingers which is why I don't like to fucking walk!"" And threw his phone in my direction. Luckily, it missed my head by a few inches. (Also, for context there's a bus system he took before walking ten minutes to our home)


I've been slowly moving in to a new apartment, and it feels so freeing. I hope to be fully out in a few weeks when my coworker helps me get some of my bigger stuff and my pets. 

I feel like I should be feeling guilty right now like I have every time I upset him for years, but I just find myself feeling excited. I'll be leaving a note the day I leave telling him exactly why I left and to never contact me again (and I'll be changing my number).

I just can't wait for a peaceful new chapter. I'm sure I'll feel guilty and mourn when I'm finally out, though. ",,,

Can’t beg him take me back, he would do a different kind of worse than when finding me. Either way, guess there’s no hope for someone like me. Should have known better.

I have been scrimping, saving, working extra to send my son (5) to the private school he wants to attend. His father works for the public school system and I am also terrified of him abducting my son if I send him there because he's threatened to before. 

So this entire year, I've been worrying about how he's going to adjust. I've been worrying about things like him only having one parent (there is a no contact order that covers the kids), us not having the wealth other students there have, etc. 

I learned yesterday that he finished this year first in his class (75) academically and obtained the only perfect score on his Kindergarten readiness exam. 

I wanted to share because 1) sometimes it can feel like good news is few and far between in this chapter of life, and 2)  if you're like me when I was making the decision to leave, you are worried about whether the children will adjust okay. I'm here, on the other side of leaving, letting you know that your children will **thrive** in a home free of abuse.",,,
1jbzjaw,He says that I traumatized him by trying to leave,SenseSpirited7892,5,2025-03-15 16:55:07+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jbzjaw/he_says_that_i_traumatized_him_by_trying_to_leave/,"Everyone in my life said he was emotionally abusive and potentially dangerous. I stayed with him for a while because he said he would change, but after a conversation with a friend I decided it couldn’t go on. 

She suggested that I just block him and possibly get a restraining order, but I still saw the good in him and didn’t feel right saying nothing, so I sent him a message explaining where I was coming from and telling him how much I loved him. I also grew close to his mom and she was abused by his father, so I sent her a message explaining things too. 

But I got so scared of leaving and worried for his safety I reached back out. He said he was upset, but that we could work it out. Then a few days later, he started berating me. He told me I was vile, vicious, cruel, that I shot him down like a dog, that he tried to kill himself and that it was my fault, that I’m horrible for not being patient with his progress. This went on for days. His mom also sided with him and hated me. He told me if I wanted things to work again I would have to put my all into being the perfect partner (or ‘wife’ as he worded it) and always put him and his mom first, even above myself.

I’ve been trying to do what he said, always cooking for him, cleaning for him, almost completely taking over taking care of the dog, trying my best to sit patiently during his angry moments. My only solace would be an hour a day where I would go to the park to engage in my own joyful movement. I was exhausted from all this. But a few days ago he sat me down and told me that I wasn’t doing enough, that my time at the park was taking away from me doing things he enjoys, that he was dissatisfied and still angry and traumatized over me trying to leave. He said that he’s been doing too good to deserve this, that I could never find someone as good as him. This went on until 1am, he wouldn’t let me go to sleep until he was done. He started again the next morning, it got to the point I was curled up on the floor sobbing. Our poor dog was shaking and peed from fright, my bf just called him a “pussy”. 

After all this, he started acting all sweet again and apologized for ‘acting like a jerk’. Things are calm now, he’s acting sweet and loving again, but after the event I called a DV hotline and they are going to set me up with a legal advocate. But now I feel awful and scared to leave again. Is he right that I’m not being patient enough with his progress? He has grown in some ways that I’m proud of him for. But all this torment feels like punishment for me trying to leave, and I’m worried about our dog, even though our dog is very attached to my bf and my bf says he loves him. I feel like I’m going crazy most of the time. Why does it feel so hard to leave? I’m scared I’ll miss the good.

He wants me completely moved into his apartment by the end of this month, and even wants to get married soon. We’ve only been together for 6 months. I want to leave before all this happens, but I fear that I’m being unfair.",,,

I’ve been out of my domestic violence relationship for over 2.5 years now. I’ve been in a very happy and healthy relationship for over a year. I’ve even doing significantly well in my life other than dealing with a lot of anxiety due to some other issues. I wouldn’t say I’ve totally healed from the abuse, I don’t know if I ever will, but things are so much better and I am happy now. 

I started taking Zoloft recently due to my emetophobia and intense anxiety about some other issues in life that I’ve always kind of dealt with. Since I started taking it, I’ve been having these horrible nightmares about myself being back in my domestic violence relationship and trying to escape to get to my current boyfriend and in the nightmare I can’t escape. I also get like brutally abused by my abuser in my nightmares and go to the er from it and all that. I’ve never had this happen before until I started taking the Zoloft. The Zoloft makes the nightmares seem so intense and real, too. 

It’s just bringing back some pretty awful memories and things that I don’t want to relive. I know there’s not much I can probably do for it, I’m just here to rant, but it’s really frustrating given how far I’ve come in my life. ",,,

I’m just so empty without him in my life for some reason.. Why is that? He constantly used to beat on me, he sent me to the emergency room a handful of times, he would always berate and degrade me.. telling me if I killed myself then everyone’s life would be so much better. Why. I spent 3 years of my life dedicated to him and our future.. I tried so hard to make him a better person because I felt awful knowing that our mutual friends hated the way he is.

I get so upset knowing that he’s out there with other women, either taking them on dates, sleeping with them in the same bed we used to hug each other in, or both. Why do I get like that? It’s like he forgot about me and all our moments together, all our plans we had for the future. I just hope these women don’t pet our cats.. Especially my little Jolyne. 

I’ve been isolated from everyone. He won’t admit what he did wrong, he will never give me closure. I just want him to acknowledge the physical abuse he put me through on a near daily basis — but I’m not sure if that will make me feel any better. He took everything I worked hard for, and now I’m homeless with nowhere to go. Maybe if I had kept my mouth shut then things wouldn’t be so bad.

I had a dream about him last night; we were in our home, on our bed. We shared the sweetest kiss, the ones I remember from the good times we shared together, and he held me in his arms. He told me he loved me, and then he stroked my hair. It felt so nice hearing his voice telling me sweet things. In that moment I felt loved.

Why do I miss him? When will my love for him go away? Is this normal?",,,

These were my encounters that are signs of DV 

Emotional: 
- Cussing at me (using foul language in arguments) 
- Calling me horrible names (b*tch, c*nt, stupid, etc)
- Disregarding my feelings to make his feelings seem bigger 
- Telling me I shouldn’t wear more “revealing” clothes because I’d be seeking men’s attention
- Constantly asking “who I’m trying to look good for” anytime I’d put a little more makeup on than usual, or do my hair 
- Saying or doing awful things to me behind closed doors, but making me feel guilty and like I’m the bad guy if anyone found out about some of the things he said or did 

Physical:
- Isolating me from my friends by saying he doesn’t like them and trying to make them seem awful (and I’m not seeing it because they’re my friends) 
- Using scare tactics during arguments: furrowing brows, showing teeth, clenching jaw
- Yelling during arguments
- Escalation from slamming his hands down during arguments, to throwing items, to throwing items at me, to grabbing me, to throwing me onto bed and pinning me down 
- Also slapping me on occasion (but never the face) 
- Driving erratically with me in the car 

There are a lot of other things he’d say or do, smaller in detail, that I won’t list here. But if anyone has questions on if what they’re experiencing is DV, please reach out. I wish I found a post like this when I was experiencing it, because at the time I couldn’t decipher if what I was experiencing was normal or abusive. Overall he was a very aggressive, narcissistic, and controlling man that could hide it well with the lovey dovey that he showed me 75% of the time. ",,,

The amount of crap I have to do/think about during this time is insane. The divorce, the finances (applying for victim assistance, the fact that he is only on the mortgage and appears to have prevented me from paying it so I don’t know when/if I’ll have someone at the door telling me the kids and I have to leave in a month, deciding to work more or wait to get the alimony my lawyer says I’m entitled to (he might not cooperate so might not be worth it to wait). He was the main provider, and a lot of our bills had both of our names on them and I had to file for bankruptcy because I can’t do it alone. Well, I felt like a complete idiot because I thought I could stop paying for my car but nope, I get to keep it but I can’t stop paying for it in the bankruptcy and I was literally like days away from it being repossessed. Thank God I had the money to pay a larger amount at once. The bankruptcy attorney kept telling me, “if you remember, we talked about all of this” and I’m thinking…no….i don’t remember. 

And then. Of course the shame associated with bankruptcy. 

I had to do so many things so quickly just to survive, to keep my kids and I safe, and I feel like I can’t retain information. I’m trying so hard. I’m writing things down. But I’m in an almost constant state of confusion waiting to have forgotten another important thing. It’s like my brain knows I have to do the necessary things: feed my kids, teach my kids, keep them safe and clean and happy. Sometimes I forget to eat myself but never to the point of passing out or anything . But all the extra financial stuff and even remembering things about friends and family that I’m normally very good about….its so hard. 

Is this normal? When will I feel like I can think straight again?!",,,

I had documented some of this, including making recordings of her threatening, hitting and insulting the children, which I gave to the police as evidence. The police and social services have questioned if I knew this has been going on for so long, why didn’t I do anything sooner?

I’m in agreement with them, I have no idea why I stayed. This last year has been particularly difficult, and I’ve honestly felt like a passenger in my own life. My honest reason for staying is that I was trying to help my wife, as she was a victim of her mum’s abuse as a child. I felt if I said anything, I’d be the one who left the family home, and I didn’t want my kids to stay with her. Too many stories about men not being believed. The police and social services don’t seem to be happy with this answer.

I think my question is, why didn’t I act? I honestly can’t explain it.",,,

I have left many times but always come back because I don't have money. I would like to get a job but I have to care for my 4 year old son. He is too young for full day kindergarten. I've looked no other free programs long enough to help. 

I am in a catch 22 because I need money to put him in daycare, but I need him in daycare before I can start working. I need money for gas but I need a car to get to work to make money. 

My husband enjoys keeping me trapped like this. Everytime I leave he cuts off my phone plan and car insurance to punish me. Since I need to live out of my car because there aren't shelters in my area, without gas money I can't sustain. 

I am waiting so patiently for my son to grow up so I can work but it's not coming soon enough. 

I take pictures everytime my husband leaves a mark on me. But my children witness everything and they have started mirroring our behavior and it makes me so sad. I need to get out. 

My family and his family have turned a blind eye. They tell me that I deserve it because I'm standing up for myself which is bad and I need to be a good submissive girl to my husband. If he beats me it's because I am not obeying him.

I have reached out to hundreds of people - lawyers, police, social workers, churches, friends, family, random strangers, the domestic hotline, been in domestic abuse shelters. But it all ends up in the same place. They tell me *I* have to leave. He won't change but *I* have to leave. Since his marks on me aren't bad enough to put him in jail for longer than a night, calling the police only makes things worse. I did that once and it made things worse. Unfortunately I just have to keep documenting and build a bigger case, or wait for him to beat me badly for police to lock him up for a long time, or wait for my son to grow up so I can get a job. 

My husband tells me once I get a job he will work less and make me pay for rent. But I will have to figure out how to not give him what he wants and just leave once I get enough money. I just have to prepare for that. 

I'm not looking for advice so much as just prayers I guess and validation. As I said I've talked to hundreds of people and they all said they can't help me, I have to help myself. ",,,

I am now looking into a protective order. He is ex military, an extreme narcissist, delusional, psychotic, pretty much everything in the book. He has had protective orders in the past. He’s also on probation with the State and job, so eventually he will lose it all. Now that he’s targeting me again, I feel that it’s getting closer to the end for him, and he is feeling the pressure, so he’s started doing it all over again. This week I am getting a new number and a burner phone. No one knows my exact location, and I’m using my resources to the best of my ability. But I am so numb. I am so tired. All I’ve wanted is a family, and since I cannot trust my own, it’s a sad reality. Sometimes, I just wish that we could reason. I feel guilty for getting him arrested in the first place 3 years ago, and I feel even more guilty that I can’t tell my family anything. I’m going to have to disappear off the planet, again. And god, it was all getting better for a split moment. And then they switched (my parents, who are divorced btw). How do I cope without having mother/father figures?

The language they use is subtly demeaning and designed to make the victim seem inferior, untrustworthy, unwell, or even malicious. They’ve even admitted that they only treat this one person this way and no one else. It mostly happens when others are not around and in targeted messages.  Does their overall kindness to others outweigh their targeted cruelty?  What if the target confides situations that they have been offended by but your interaction with the offender is pleasant?

Ended a long-term relationship with someone who I really loved deeply, but unfortunately had not managed to work out his mental health/emotional abuse issues throughout our 4-year relationship. We were engaged but I postponed the engagement and then broke things off because he wouldn’t stop his behaviors, try hard enough to change, or seek therapy, no matter how many times I begged him to.

He never hit me or physically abused me but he had a huge anger problem (he has trauma and impulse control issues and grew up with abusive parents) and would yell at me, call me horrific names (swear words, insults, name-calling), dump me, threaten to leave me or end the relationships dozens of times, give me the silent treatment, throw things around the house, kick stuff, punch/slam his fists, break random things, etc. It was really stressful and caused me immense anguish and I asked him so many times to treat me better, he would apologize and be better for awhile until doing it again after a few weeks or months.

I eventually reached my breaking point when his last episode (involving him acting aggressive and screaming/throwing things around the house, but not at me) caused me a nervous breakdown. I was in a fight or fight mode and basically couldn’t function for weeks.

We broke up, but he’s recently been making a big effort to work on his mental health and says he will do anything to change and better himself as a human. He says he recognized the error in his ways, the abuse cycle, how he abused me, and is finally actually doing the things I asked him to do all those years. He is meditating every day, going to therapy, and his overall mood and demeanor seems to be very different. He says that me standing up to him and not taking his BS anymore has given him a massive wake-up call about how destructive his behaviors and mental health have been to him and to everyone around him. He says he wants to change and be a better version of him, not just for me, but for himself. He seems generally less reactive, angry, and explosive. I really love the calm, sweet side of him - the kind, caring side that’s not so tormented by his own trauma and rage. I miss this side, it’s who I fell in love with.

So we are in a limbo state. We broke up, but we are talking, so not exactly together but not fully apart either. I’m considering giving him another chance in a few months or so if I am convinced that he’s actually taking the right steps. I miss and love him dearly but I am still very unsure. We have talked about how I’m unsure, and how neither of us are in a place to go on dates with or sleeping with other people right now.

The thing is, over the past couple of months, about 3-4 men have hit on me/seemed to possibly express some level of interest in me (which hasn’t happened in years; I swear somehow men can sense if you’re not in a committed relationship!). One was an old friend from high school who ran into me, another was at a pizza place, and a coffee shop. I told my high school friend (we chatted for a bit and I couldn’t tell if he was flirting with me) that I’m open to friendship but not emotionally available to date (because of my complicated relationship situation). 

When a random guy around my age struck up a conversation with me at the coffee shop, I was friendly and chatted. I was not flirtatious, just nice and friendly as I would be to anyone talking to me, and had no idea if it was inappropriate of me to be talking with him. We didn’t talk about dating or anything inappropriate, just talked about the area, how there aren’t many people our age here (most people are much older than me and it can get lonely!), jobs, etc. I enjoyed talking with him but also felt so guilty about it. Was I leading him on? Being disloyal to my ex, who I have a complicated relationship with? I didn’t tell him about my complicated relationship status because it didn’t come up and it would have felt very awkward to mention it. He asked for my number to stay in touch and since we were having a friendly chat I gave it to him, as I have to other friends I’ve met (I recently connected with a couple of women and gave them my number too). 

I can’t help but feel like I did something wrong and I feel so confused and icky about all of this. If the coffee shop guy asks me out on a date I’ll just tell him that he seems like a genuinely cool person and I appreciate connecting as friends but I’m ending a complicated long-term relationship and not emotionally available to date right now. Was it wrong for me to talk with him? Should I have ignored him when he was friendly and approached me to say hi? Told him immediately that I have a boyfriend/partner (even tho I don’t)? Should I have refused to give him my number when he asked (I was conflicted but didn’t want to be rude to someone who was friendly)? All the work I do is virtual and I often feel so isolated and lonely these days, it’s nice having people be friendly to me. I would have also been thrilled if a woman my age approached me and gave me her number to stay in touch as friends.

I've been reading about the cycle of abuse, and I too watched my mum get abused.

I am with an abuser, but its my own fault. He doesn't really beg me to stay, he doesn't hold me captive. We don't have children together and we don't even live together. So why do I find it so hard to let go?

Last time we were together two weeks ago I was trying to play a game. He dropped his toast on the bed I was sitting on and I asked if he could clean it. He asked me to get up and I said I dont need to get up, he can just get a dustpan to clean it. He ended up throwing his toast at me. I told him he was acting childish and he ended up pouring an entire drink over my head. I locked myself in the bathroom after that until he left.

  
We've barely spoken since. This isn't the first time he has done something like this. But this time is different. Yes, I say this to myself every time. The abuse always changes. But this time, he didn't even say sorry. When we have spoken, he justifies his behaviour. He said I shouldn't have called him names. He said he would do it again. I was disgusted when he said this. To go back would be me saying ""I give you permission to abuse me.""

Yet I know, when I will be lonely, which happens often as I don't have any friends, I will think of him. I will idolise the good parts in our relationship, which is literally just him accepting me for who I am - Someone who's done mostly nothing with their life.

How do I stop? Has anyone else felt this way? Am I the only person who cant let go of being repeatedly abused just because of 1 good day in a month? What is wrong with me?",,,

I was doing pretty good, spending time with friends, going out more and taking back my control. However this week it's been...rough.

Sure, I occasionally had flashbacks and heard him call me stupid, all the favorite curse words (b***h, c**t, w***e, etc), all the verbal abuse and assaults and it didn't bug me as much. But this week has been rough with it amping up to the point where my nightmares came back and having panic attacks at work just being near the men. It's just been so bad and like...I knew it'd happen, but I didn't expect it to get this bad after 6 months of leaving. 

My question is, does it get better? With handling the flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety of being found? What does healing look like? I'm in therapy, there's a safety plan enforced at my job who's aware of the situation, I'm with friends and enjoying my hobbies again and relying on my support group but...I don't even know what HEALED looks like, or at least healing progress. Will it ever get better? I don't miss him, nor do I ever want to go back especially since my life would be at risk, but I just want to know if it'll get better and what does ""better"" even look like with everything that has happened?

Our relationship has been on and off for about a year and a half. We met August 2023, moved in together in November 2023, lived together until March 2024, when I moved back to my parents house because the abuse was too much. I was hospitalized for SI in December, 2023 and tried to kms in February 2024. 

He moved to be closer to me (my parents were in a different state then where we lived). It had always just been emotional and verbal abuse but now he was getting more aggressive. Once he lunged across the bed at me because I was trying to leave. Another time he wanted me to leave and I was waiting for my mom in the living room and he pushed me and then picked me up and dragged me outside, slammed the door in my face and then came out the side door to continue yelling at me. 

I've been trying to break up with him for a long time but I always miss him.

This time was different because I actually reported him to the police after he sent nudes of me to people and said he was going to kill me if I didn't answer his call. (I was really trying to move on and he didn't like that)

But I still miss him. I want someone to hold me and to love me, and when he wasn't abusive he made me feel so loved and not alone. 

I feel guilty that I'm ruining his life by pressing charges against him and I'm overreacting to the situation because he didn't actually hurt me he just said he would.

She left a day earlier because his weekend shift got cancelled and she realized he will likely “celebrate” that extra free day with a drink.

Your comments and stories helped a lot. After discussing them over the phone, she realized that she cannot afford to spend one more weekend with him, because it will very likely become her last weekend.

She did not tell him anything and didn’t leave the letter. She, unfortunately, decided to take his call, and he went from “love of my life, where are you, I am worried sick” to a “you dirty bitch, you used me” real quick. She blocked him after the call. I do not think he can track her - he isn’t exactly technical, their phones have different operating systems, and she disabled l location services. 

Thank you all very much.

ORIGINAL POST

Disclaimer: I am writing about a situation of my relative because her reddit is being actively monitored by her abuser. I will be able to call her to share comments. 

I do not know all the details and their history of the abuse, I only know that “it was not that bad before” and that it has rapidly escalated about a month ago - that’s when she reached out to me for help. He hit and strangled her several times, there are photos of bruises on her neck and recordings of conversation that lead to one of the attacks.

She is ready to leave this weekend while he is at work. She has most basics packed, some cash stashed, and a temporary housing arranged in a different city. She, however, feels uneasy about leaving unannounced. She wants to somehow let him know that she left. She is convinced that it isn’t a big deal because the abuser is only physically violent when he is drunk. She says she only expects him to be verbally aggressive.

I think it is a bad idea because what if her farewell causes things to escalate even more? He is a very strong man and she is a physically sick weak woman. There is absolutely no way she can fight back if he attacks her again. I believe she is not dead only because he let her live.

I need some tips/advice please.",,,

I spoke with a “friend” who ended up blaming me :( she said “why do you keep allowing him the space to hit you?” :/ then she told me to “mace him” and I said “that’s illegal” (the state we live in isn’t a stand your ground state) and she says, “I don’t care” then, one thing that gets to me is the, “if it were me…” because if it were YOU (or her) she would act however she’ll act but I’m not her and she isn’t me. Our lifestyles are different too. I’m a full time stay at home mom and I rely on my abuser’s income. She’s a mom too but she works— she’s a flight attendant so she gets to travel too. When she was a stay at home mom, she was a lot more compassionate, but now she’s back to who she was before, and she feels good about herself. I’m just… a mom… trying to survive. It makes me not want to talk about it. I don’t have the income to leave in a flash but I have a plan! And my plan is in motion, just because people don’t see it at lighting speed doesn’t mean it’s not happening BUT I HATE THAT TOO!!!! That I feel like I have to explain myself :/ but no one asks him to explain why he’s abusive. I felt good prior to speaking with her, like, I was ready to talk about it but now I just don’t want to talk to people I know. I feel safer with y’all, strangers on the internet, than friends. I have no tangible community.",,,

I just want to share solitude and love to everyone that’s either healing after leaving, contemplating how to escape, and those that are unfortunately just experiencing the horrific behavior of our abusers. You matter, this is not your fault, and you absolutely are worthy of safety. Abuse can make us feel less than, because an abusive person’s low self-esteem encourages them to hurt us. Even though it may be difficult, I want you to know for a solid fact, you DO deserve more and you’re sooooo special. You light up the room when you walk in, you make someone happy that you’re alive, and there are people wishing for a you. 

What I’ve come to understand is that these abusers really hate themselves and their lives, so they try to reconcile that by being horrible to others. They believe this false sense of superiority and it’s just making them worse off. Even if you’re standing up for yourself, that’s still not a reason for you to be abused. I don’t care what they try to tell you. I still battle with the guilt of leaving people I really loved, but I’d rather be safe and offered genuine love than fearing the next form of abuse. I’m not saying you won’t be scared after escaping, but at least you have the certainty of yourself and no one attacking you every chance they get. These people are not on the same emotional and mental level as us, whereas we try to do good in the world and work on ourselves.

I used to cry because the person I loved so deeply kept actively choosing to tear me down and abuse me, despite me begging, presenting healthy connection tactics, praying, offering them spiritual advice, and reasoning with “a potential justified cause” of this behavior. Multiple times and it unfortunately had been happening this way my entire life. I urge you to find good community and expose yourself to a healthy relationship. You’ll see so quickly the red flags that they’d manipulated to look like slight yellows and light greens in the beginning or throughout the relationship.

I get hesitant to write about the very real experience, because I get watched online. That’s the worst part about it. I will never understand how someone could choose to hurt you, so you feel unwanted. But when you leave and seek support they even know you deserve, they either watch you or have people do it for them. Blasphemous. It just speaks to the fact that you do not deserve this. Over the past 4-5 years, my abusers have stalked me and continually harassed me with post-relational abuse, even though I let them be and chose to heal in private. You don’t have to. You can be as loud about your pain as you need, because you suffer in silence. You deserve to heal. You deserve to smile. You deserve true love.

I watched a video this morning of a girl about to marry a man that wasn’t even sure of her and now, she’s marrying a very good man, who believes her to be his best friend and the true love of his life. The reality is, unlike what some of us have heard similarly but were never treated right, this man was all about his talk. So, I say this to say that your love is waiting for you in SO many forms, please know it’s possible for each of us. TRUE Love finds you in the ways that you need the most throughout life, and it’ll never make you feel confused. Not about yourself of anything else. It’ll be the most certain and safest experience you’ve ever had. I’m wishing the best for you all. 

If you ever need emotional support or affirmations, please contact me! Xo",,,
1jablxw,He has a drinking problem and is kicking me out,NoPractice111,3,2025-03-13 13:11:19+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jablxw/he_has_a_drinking_problem_and_is_kicking_me_out/,"Hi friends, not sure if this is the right subreddit but I’m grasping at straws here. 
A little backstory:
My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months. We met off Tinder, but went to the same high school and have many mutual friends. After our first date, he was constantly trying to go on more dates with me and I was enamored; the connection was there. We began dating shortly after and he moved into a new house that needed some help fixing up. I helped him fix the house, and at that point I was spending so much time there that he was begging me to move in with him. Everything was great so far, so I figured why not. Through the months I met his whole family and I loved them, they accepted me as one of their own. We talked about marriage, having kids, how we’re both ready to settle down and have a family. 

We eventually moved into a new house (renting) and that’s when things started to take a turn. He started drinking, and he’s not the kind of person who can handle it. He doesn’t know when to stop. He will drink until he is belligerent and a completely different person. Usually when he gets that drunk, he will start an argument with me and try to pack up his things so he can leave. I never let him drive like that, so he’s never actually left. Every day after a fight like that’ll, we always talk about how he has a problem with drinking and he’s going to stop. The usual. At first the fights were a month or two apart. And then it was every two weeks. This week it’s already happened twice. 

Last night after he lied to get me out of the house, he made me sit at a bar with him and his friend while he got drunk, and refused to let me drive his car. He then drove to drop his friend off, and then sat in his driveway with him for 3 hours drinking close to 18 beers while I sat there and twiddled my thumbs. My phone was dead at this point and I couldn’t do anything. Then he tries to leave. He can barely walk, can’t speak a coherent sentence, and wants to drive. At this point I’m crying, begging him to let me drive because I am stone cold sober. My best friend died from being in the car with a drunk driver and I am extremely uneasy about the situation. He refuses, rips out of the driveway, and takes down his friend’s mailbox. He severely damages the side of his car, gets a flat, and knocks off his side mirror in one go. He has to pull over and tells me to get a ride. My phone is dead, he will not let me use his. It is 1am. He starts calling me toxic for trying to control his drinking, and breaks up with me. 

I sit here now in our shared house and I am unsure what to do. I have no money to my name. He hasn’t let me have our (private) landlord’s number this whole time, and is saying he’s calling her to tell her I need to leave. All of my things are here and I have nowhere to go. I have also paid 40% of the rent this month which is good for 24 more days. Can he legally kick me out with no warning period..? Not that I want to stay, but I do need somewhere to rest my head while I figure out my next steps. I really am just at a loss. I got a concussion a few days ago (unrelated) and that, mixed with the emotions of what is going on is rendering me unable to think. 

TLDR; (now ex) boyfriend is trying to kick me out of a house that I have paid 40% of rent for, effective immediately.",,,

Well the last couple instances i find myself wishing i could have someone that makes me feel safe. Wishing i could experience a normal relationship before i die. Thinking about what i have to offer outside of the pain i carry etc. is this unhealthy? I have kids and haven’t even left yet and no job or family to go to. Why the change in my thoughts?

I don’t really know if my feelings are valid or if i really am being controlling and crazy. I’m very confused. 

We moved to a new place to disconnect from the city and the corporate world after he had a mental breakdown (justifiable) *insert terrible act of injustice that he suffered*Husband said he’s not gonna make any friends or be his very outgoing bubbly self. We argued about this as i thought it incredibly unrealistic and he tends to have these dramatic introspective (but not actually solving the real problem) episodes. Anyways He’s a smart,funny, humble relatable guy and people flock to him when he shows this side. We went through a very rough patch where he determined he was gonna spend a lot of time rebuilding broken pieces of our relationship and emphasized spending all our time together. He would say that if he could find a place cheap enough he’d not go back to work and we would just spend time together. It was a hard time for me. I do enjoy spending all my time with him but he was having frequent episodes of anger and distress about large scale/macro things like economics or religion, government corruption etc. all things i can’t solve but have to listen to and not piss him off with an opinion he doesn’t like. Fast forward we are here and he’s very outgoing making friends with everyone and constantly cracking jokes and making everyone smile. He’s fast tracking his way into every friendship that comes up. He drops our religion of 4 years and the friends we made with it. He did have valid reasons for the friendships and valid issues with the religion that can’t be ignored but he did it abruptly and we have kids. There was no drinking, no smoking, no cursing,  now he does all three simultaneously. He says people change and went from us being a team and me being “the most important thing in his life” to me being a bitch thst doesn’t allow him to grow  as a person. People change over time. I’d bring up that not everyone is a good look for a friend. People that are drinking alot and using vulgar language a lot aren’t the people we want to attach to at this stage in our lives with young kids and goals to be better and do better. But when i try to talk about this he says I’m crazy. I feel like he switches up too often and i have nothing that i can count on as a stable trait of his. I feel very insecure in the instability. I’ll try to express it, he will deny deny deny and the. He will eventually say something mean and off topic. Or even bring up a reason why I’m stupid in comparison to him and then it just all goes to shit and I’m calling him vindictive and abusive. And he’s telling me that the thing that angers him most and that I’m basically asking for it when i call him those names. He has a rule that i can’t track his character or he will lose it. What a mess.

1ja0anb,My 4 year relationship with my BPD ex fiancé.,Cam9101,2,2025-03-13 01:12:23+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ja0anb/my_4_year_relationship_with_my_bpd_ex_fiancé/,"I have recently left a 4 year relationship. A very very bad, abusive in the final year, relationship that ended with me with my father and her with the friends she constantly complained to me about.

When we separated it was after she dumped filthy cat litter on my head that I had to clean from my hair for 2 days. She would often throw glass and ceramic, pans, etc but glass was always broken when she snapped. 

She has BPD in the 2nd degree and has been cheated on before which is why I always tried to be open and honest with her. It got to the point in year 2 we just couldn't make things work and we took time from each other. Foolishly I allowed myself to have sex with two women in two days because I was scared and destroyed mentally. My last relationship ended similar to how it was going and I spiraled, which I did voice to her but it's no excuse for my actions in weakness. After that I promised I'd tell her when we got back together. 

This unfortunately came at a bad time because she would eventually ask me if I had done anything while we were apart. Yes I had but at the time I know she couldn't handle if I just came out and said it; so I lied. To this day its the only lie I've ever told her but she would eventually go through my phone with the passcode I gave her because I didn't mind her going through my phone and she discovers the messages from 1 of the women and she proceeds to toss my ps5 and throw me out of her place, I was staying at college during this time. I wanted to leave and keep the 2nd secret but I'm not a liar so I told her about the second. I embarrassingly banged on her door to no avail for 30 minutes , she would take me back like 2 weeks later.

Yet people with BPD have a hard time coping with betrayal especially from those who they live dearly. 

From that point on she saw me as not ""black"" or ""white"" but a grey area ""what will I do next"". ((I allowed her to have my passcode and passwords after this.)) Our relationship deteriorated slowly for the next two years she'd call me a b word often, blame-shift, accuse, deny feeling uncomfortable or down, accuse me of babying her by acknowledging her illness when she would demean herself, and in the last year hit me, hate me, deny me sex, deny me her presence, run to her friends she claimed to be upset with all the time and even doing petty things like unplugging the wifi box and throwing water on me. What scared me the most and when I knew it was over was when she threatened to break my glasses, I'm virtually blind without them. I also have had the cops called on me 3 times in her rages when I held her down to not cut herself on glass I ALWAYS HAD TO CLEAN.

I hated her friends after a while because they were like her and I tried to understand why they disliked me so much but it's because she never after going off to them about me, went back and fixed the wrong things she said. She accused me of sabotaging her car after we split even though she scratched mine and also broke 2 of my TVs

I hate that her life will be easy because I know it will. She doesn't feel my pain; last message I sent her was about a month ago, a final goodbye and she just called me weird and I apologized. I still think of her often her voice, the gap of her teeth, her sad face, her joy eating my food. I wish I could forget her moans, we were so in tune or so I thought and now someone else will have her. She's pretty, has a fat ass, dresses decently and is bisexual(that's a little joke). No but seriously she's with her friends now and I'm sure they're out there blaming me and having the world fall at their feet.

I hate all of her friends but one the most and I'll say his name Max. He's a trans man who we both(me and my ex fiancé)wanted to at a certain point have a threesome with okay cool cool. We ended up falling out multiple time because my ex fiancé would come home and complain to me about him and I had enough but you can't ever make someone drop their friends; this friend was bad for them, still I let it go. We tried to make up and we're in his words ""associates"" at the time he asked me this question no bs ""do you want to watch my partner and my ex fiancé naked cooking for us on valentines. I was like that's cool and all and we continued to talk more and he eventually said we aren't friends and I was like but you legit just asked to see my partner naked in a kitchen gown? 

My ex fiancé would never take my side against her friends I even went off on two of them like 3 times before I called it quits trying to help that way.

so she would eventually conceal problems she had with her friends. This would make her feel as if well ""if I don't want to talk to him about something I don't have to"" I SHOULD'VE LEFT THEN. Communication became shoddy and eventually we wouldn't even interact anymore for weeks and even texting became mundane and she'd block me on social media and not post me or follow me often. It became embarrassing to post the pictures over and over. 

A month before we separated I sexted a girl one night on Snapchat and in my soul I knew I knew she was coming to check my phone because I had changed the passcode on my phone earlier in the day so she could see me struggle to put my passcode in. I hate that we separated but I just couldn't take being ignored anymore I deserved better so I left my phone on the charger woke up to her accusing me of cheating the entire time, keep in mind she hadn't come into my room to see me for about a month and a half towards the end of our last year together. I just didn't care anymore. I didn't consider us together at that point she would block me and go to her friends often our last kiss was in a Wendy's parking lot where I ""struggled"" with my passcode.

If any partner refuses to communicate LEAVE, you don't know what you don't know.

I'm happy it ended but I hate being without her no one will take the time I did with her. I was 19 when we began I am 23 now. We lived together in our own place for 2 years and had 2 cats that she took in the end she now lives with her friend and I'm ruined. ",,,

No family no close friends. A ridiculous amount of context here, but I don’t know what’s important anymore.

My husband has severe mental health struggles, and it’s taken a huge toll on our marriage. The breaking point for him was losing a brutal custody battle for his child. The forensic psychiatrist and guardian ad litem both recommended we get custody, but the judge ruled against us, leaving his daughter with her mother. He had documented abuse from his ex and even had her father testify against her, but nothing changed.

After that, he completely unraveled—shaving his head in a rage, quitting his job, blowing all our money, and putting us into debt until we had to sell our home. His ex-wife was a constant source of stress and conflict, and even after winning, she continued making life difficult.

The Abuse and Escalation

During this time, he became emotionally and verbally abusive—chasing me around the house, screaming in my face, demanding that I hit him, and then cycling through apologies before doing it all over again. His best friend even stayed with us and told me I should leave but didn’t want to say too much because they’re childhood friends.

This isn’t new behavior. Early in our relationship, I hit him first during an argument while drunk. Police were there for the music being loud and he told me to go into one of the rooms. I said no, he grabbed my arm and i punched him in the face. To stop me he punched me several times, and I briefly lost consciousness. I carried guilt for this and still believe I was at fault. You shouldn’t hit anyone unless you have to, right? And i despise women who hit men because they know that they can’t hit them back. I’m very remorseful and ashamed about it. A year Later, we had a heated argument over something trivial (whether robots can have emotions), and when I tried to walk away, he grabbed me by the neck, threw me on the bed, and choked me.

For years, he told me I was the reason he screamed and that I needed to “learn to shut up.” He said if I attacked his character (calling him crazy, pointing out overreactions, saying he was a bad friend or a bad person), he would react aggressively. I internalized this and tried to be careful, but no matter what I did, if he was in the mood to rage, he would. He once dragged me across the floor, crouched over me, screaming in my face—despite me following every rule he set for how I should respond to his outbursts. I brought this to his attention several times and no explanation. He gave me all these things i better not do because it’ll provoke him and nothing worked? 



In December of last year We moved to a farm for a fresh start, selling our house and getting an RV. I handled the financial mess he created, even had to sue a contractor who ran off with our money, and made the transition happen. Everything outside of us is wonderful here, but inside our marriage, things have gotten worse.

Religious Shift & More Instability

We had converted to Islam four years ago, and it brought a lot of stability. Then suddenly, after moving, he abandoned the faith, started drinking, smoking, and engaging in inappropriate conversations with coworkers. I told him I was uncomfortable, but he dismissed me as controlling. He often takes me with him to hang out. Maybe like 70% of the time I’m with him and he’s actively engaging me and making me a part of the socialization. It’s not like I’m sitting on the side. He says people just feel comfortable around us and think we are cool so they just spill their guts which is just not appropriate and i rather not participate because it all sounds like mess. Drama and mess and inappropriate context. 

But before the farm these instances happened -

One night after a fight, he went to the train tracks and said he was going to kill himself. Another time, he choked me because I stayed up late working as an admin for a friend’s religious YouTube channel. He called me a “piece of sh*t” for not prioritizing his feelings over that, even though he was asleep when I started working. After that, he checked himself into a mental institution.

His behavior swings between suicidal, homicidal, or being the sweetest, most loving man. He has moments where he’s completely devoted, then suddenly shuts me out. He has extreme attunement skills, gives me his undivided attention, wants to be around me 24/7.

After we got to the farm,

Over the religious conversation where i brought my concerns to him about the drastic change and what to tell the kids and how uncomfortable i am with feeling like he ripped everything away, he yelled and kicked me and the kids out of the rv. It took me some times to pack and when we got on the road he text saying to comeback and that hes got to start putting the kids first and that we can live together and maybe something will change in the future. So i came back. 

Now last night we go to a neighbors to sit springs the fire and that neighbor and another neighbor want to talk about sexual stuff. In particular one wanted to talk a bit how he was sexually harassed by a girl who just recently moved back and the other neighbor thought it was funny and just egged it on etc. i was just kinda sitting there nervous chuckling and wishing i was dead. I am modest in nature and he knows that and has promised to keep certain boundaries in agreeance with me. But then he decided not to and there’s no discussion. He did tell them to steer the conversation in another direction and they didn’t and i know he can’t control other adults but i see groups around the farm and this one they constantly talks bad about other people and talks about sexual stuff isn’t the one i war to be a regular member of nor does it align with anything we planned or promised each other and he acts like im just controlling. Maybe he’s right? Idk. Well we went home and i said nothing and we enjoyed the rest of our night and i was sweet to him just trying tk ans sense of everything ur j was quiet this morning. He said he was going i. Late so he could help around the house. One of those moments where he’s like the best husband ever and this does happen regularly.  But i was short and kind of melancholy so he jerk asking what wrong and i kept saying i didn’t wanna talk about it and that it’s not an emergency or anything.  After i took the laundry to the laundry room we stepped outside and i told him idk if i really want to be at this farm anymore. I’ve earned him about his overly inviting behavior and how we have opportunity to build friendships with people who hold the same values and he’s slowly but surely pushing us into the drinking, smoking, cussing , vulgar group despite us being invited to a birthday with managers and owners only and not that that makes them good people by they’re wholesome and have good habits and that’s what they want. They could’ve been the Janitor, mailman, chef, poop scooper and i would’ve been happy if they all aligned with us on what’s important and valued family and doing good. Anyways he listened and then said that he tried to steer the conversation but can’t control that they do. I told him that i get that but it’s not about this conversation it’s about boundaries. I don’t have people coming up to me telling me who they screwed last night because I’ve established boundaries. He says that means he can’t talk to anyone at all and I’m controlling him. I tell him i don’t want to talk anymore and I’m going to let the kids know I’m driving him a cross the street and he says “we already told them, you remember all that’s hit but can’t remember that we told them”

So i get pissed because he does this when the conversion isn’t going in his favor. He starts jabbing at me so i tell him that’s what he’s doing right now ant to stop and he starts yelling and escalating and telling me to just drop him off because he’s done. So now im emotional and telling him im too old for this shit anymore. And he tells me I’m crazy and to pull over and let him out of the car on the side of the highway and i say no there’s 2 semi trucks behind us and he grabs the steering wheel and out his foot in the driver area to press the break. I let him out and drive off then i stop and call him and tell him he better get back in the car because he’s gonna hear me and that he doesn’t shit every time. He gets the spotlight off the issue and then just fights with me so he gets in the car and i yell at him and say I’m tired of this cycle and i didn’t even want to talk because i knew it would end this way and i said he didn’t do what he should to avoid boundaries and at that moment he screamed to let him out because im not recognizing that he said to steer the conversation which was him establishing a boundary that the neighbors just didn’t respect.
He choked me and punched me in the face, grabbed the steering wheel, put his foot down in the driver pedal area. And i called 911. A manger from his job pulled up to see if we were ok and he told them i was holding him hostage and i told him that he punched  me in my face. I’ve never called 911 before despite all the previous instances. 
I don’t even know what’s relevant anymore. I’m so exhausted and have been for a long time.  

Every time this happens i feel immediate guilt and wish i had said nothing or said the right things. I almost always crumble first. He’s been my best friend for so long and in such a derp level that i just feel like i can’t breathe if we are at odds. We have been through alot and faced alot together and even have a 4 year old ",,,

He was originally going to take a plea deal but could not attend the mandated DV classes due to starting a new job apparently.  The prosecutor refused to accommodate him and change the plea deal so the case is going to trial. I just found out today after expecting this to be over. 

I’m so scared the judge won’t believe me. It’s my word against his. I went to the police a week later after staying at his apartment multiple days after the assault and I feel dumb. The only charge is obstruction of breathing because he put his fingers down my throat which impeded my breathing. There is no way to prove this. I did go to the doctor a week later and was diagnosed with a concussion. I submitted photos of my hair pulled out along with a photo of my lip bleeding after the assault. These photos were taken at his apartment after the assault. 

He had submitted security cam footage from the camera that was in his room when it happened as evidence it “didn’t happen”. He cut out part of the video (obviously when he tackled me to the ground), the prosecutor found out after examining the footage. That part obviously does not make him look good but it doesn’t prove that he did anything. I guess I’m just looking for some reassurance and positive words. ",,,

This occurrence I started the fight by being angry, he threw me on the couch and strangled me and I ran into the corner, and he followed and I hit him twice in the face.  He blocked me on everything and kicked me out. Not proud of my actions. Im wondering if I file a report the case would fall back on me since I hit him.

I have BPD and can be difficult with my insecurities and anxiety and had many many episodes but i know he shouldnt of hurt me physically

 I've sent really nasty messages a month prior lmao threatening to slash his tires if he cheated on me- call me crazy- I never did it lol but idk if those would fall on me or irrelevant.

For context: I moved into my apartment about a year ago and I live next to a couple. I have repeatedly heard the man scream at her and call her disgusting names. About a week ago I heard a bang against the wall followed by him yelling obscenities at her and I called the police because I was concerned that he had either punched the wall, or that he had slammed her against the wall. Today I heard him screaming his head off yet again calling her a stupid bitch and telling her to shut the fuck up and I decided to call the police again and explain that I called the other night. When they showed up today, I watched through my peep hole and they spoke to her for a while and then I don’t know how but she ended up getting arrested instead and she started crying as the cops took her away in cuffs.",,,

When we got home i got changed into some shorts and a t shirt, i vaguely remember being half on the bed and half off like my legs off still stood up and him coming up behind me pulling my shorts down and well yeah, when he finished he told me i had bled and he left to clean up- i remember crying but stopping before he came back in and when he did he asked me like a dozen times if i was okay. The next day i brought it up explaining i hadn’t said yes and he told me i’d just repeated idk to him and that i didn’t say no. i’m not entirely sure i understand what happened to me, if something happened to me. 

edit- i can confirm i wasn’t roofied however i was on medication which made drinking hit harder it was one of the reasons i hadn’t drank in a while i wasnt blackout but i was definitely not sober id say i was probably like a 7/10 drunk. i think i ended up drinking a bottle of 9% wine then i also had a lot of shots of vodka, captain jacks and malibu we had been playing drinking games and beer pong but with vodka and captain jacks as the mixer. I’ve also woken up sometimes to him touching me down there over and under my pants before but he’s pulled away the moment ive woken up and pushed his hands away i just feel i should mention this as well.

He moved to my country and lived with me for the last 2 months we were together (he’s gone now thankfully). There had been red flags when we were together in another country but I was in a vulnerable state and made excuses for his behaviour. The abuse ramped up when he was here and was pretty constant - controlling, jealous, manipulative, verbally and emotionally abusive and would smash things in anger. The night I left he came close to attacking me and threatened to badly harm himself in front of me. 

It’s been heavy unpacking since then and realising all the patterns. 

At one point I’d tried to put my foot down, he seemed to be having more self control, then one night reverted and it was bad and worse from there. He had told me that night was because he’d found out his daughter (w her mom in his home country) was very ill. He’d been unable to get a work permit so even though I’m currently unemployed we were living off what little I had. I gave him extra money “to send back for cancer screening tests” and from there he claimed it was leukaemia and likely terminal and he needed €400 for chemo. I was broke so maintained I couldn’t help but felt awful.

After I kicked him out and he want back to his country, I found a crack pipe in my place. He claimed he never used it and hadn’t used in 5 years (long before we’d met).

His mom contacted me today, he’d stabbed himself in the leg aiming for his artery and she was saying she wants to get him help. First time she spoke to me openly in confidence - it was quickly clear he’d lied to her about me shutting him out and I took the chance to ask about his daughter as the “facts” had gotten very confusing. Suffice to say it was all a lie and (thankfully for her) his daughter is fine. He’d been using since getting back there so was probably using the extra money while here for drugs.

I can’t believed I shared a bed with this guy. I worked for decades to learn to trust people and he’s stolen so much of that progress from me. He lied about his own daughter being terminally ill just to trick me into staying with him, put up with his abuse and give him drug money. 

I’m so glad I’m out and fought the first moments of reconsidering, but it’s just so sad. And now I’m so isolated all this came out today including getting sent a picture of his leg covered in blood and I’ve no one in this city I feel I can ask to keep me company this evening or just give me a hug as so many of my friendships have become so much more distant. 

Feeling really alone and sad rn so thanks to anyone for reading and just want to skip all these realisations and be over this saga already. ",,,

I didn't talk to my mom from age 11 to age, probably 34 because of a nasty divorce where she hit me when I was a kid. 

Fast forward, now we are on okay terms and my daughter stays with her from time to time. 

She confided in me that her she doesn't want to call him boyfriend, but guy that lives with her occasionally hits her when he gets angry. 

She will not call the cops. She's the type of person that doesn't have a cell phone. Just a landline and lives in the middle of nowhere. No internet etc. 

I felt like if I was closer to her I would probably just handle him myself. He's not a very tough guy. I could lift more weights than him when I was 11 if that gives any context. 

I don't want to get in legal trouble. I'm not sure where to go from here. I also don't want to confront him and then have him kill her later after I'm gone. 

He's a real looked up too guy in their community as well. Church going religious nut.

We, the undersigned, call on Congress to pass the Justice Without Time Limits Act, which would eliminate the statute of limitations for rape and domestic violence cases resulting in injury. Survivors deserve the right to seek justice, no matter how much time has passed.
 
Why This Matters:
 Many survivors delay reporting due to trauma, fear, or systemic failures in law enforcement.
 Thousands of rape kits remain untested across the country, allowing perpetrators to walk free.
 Advances in forensic DNA technology allow cases to be solved even decades later.
Survivors own their DNA and deserve access to rape kit results upon request.
No perpetrator should evade justice simply because of an arbitrary legal time limit.
 
We Demand:
The elimination of the statute of limitations for rape and domestic violence injuries at the federal and state level in the United States.
Mandatory rape kit testing and a national rape kit tracking system.
The right for survivors to access their DNA test results without obstruction.
 Special Victims Units (SVUs) in every law enforcement agency, ensuring trained officers handle these cases properly.
 
Justice should never expire. We urge Congress to take immediate action by sponsoring and passing the Justice Without Time Limits Act. Survivors deserve better.
 
Sign this petition and demand justice today!

I want to break up so badly but I care deeply for him. So deeply in fact that I’ve sacrificed my needs and self worth for the entirety of our relationship. 

We got together in August of 2022, I was 17F and he was 22M. We’re now 20F, 25M. I thought he was perfect, everything I’d ever needed as I have not had a good history of  “relationships”. I consider him my first everything.

It didn’t stay perfect for long. 2-3mo in he started cheating on me and starting physically altercations and it only got worse from there. I was naive and thought if I loved him the way I wanted him to love me, I’d fix him. 

In January of 2024, I found out I was pregnant. He demanded I get an abortion, his family even offered to pay for it. I told him no and that if he wants he can be a deadbeat bum and pay for child support. Somehow I forgave him and let him stay. 

He was good during my pregnancy until he wasn’t. He was getting off to people behind my back and there were 2 times during my pregnancy that I felt my life may had been in jeopardy. I haven’t told anyone about those 2 incidents. I forgave him, believing he’d never do it again. But it wracks my brain every single day.

He was so sweet, caring and gentle during the birth of our daughter. Yet somehow still found time 5 days after giving birth to like p0rn on FB of a pregnant woman after refusing intimacy with me during my pregnancy. The incidents that happened during my pregnancy and postpartum have scarred me mentally and feel truly unforgivable… 

The last time he has done anytbing to jeopardize our relationship that I know of was a month ago. I told him that was my last straw. I tried to forgive him but all of this has added up tremendously. The problem is, I believe he genuinely has changed in this past month. He’s everything I waited for him to be for so long but I can’t forget the past. I can’t trust him fully. I fantasize about being and living alone every single day. Raising my daughter alone, with me. It is effecting me deeply to feel like by staying, I’m playing with his emotions and his head/giving him false hope… I care for him deeply but I don’t know if I love him romantically anymore. Thinking of marriage makes my stomach turn… and we’re engaged. I just.. I’m so at a loss. I wish the best for him truly but I feel at my end, even though we get along well as of recently. He talks to me tenderly but I find myself hating him most of the time. It hurts my heart. He told me the other day “it’s okay if you still hate me”. Except it’s not. I believe he’s changed. I just don’t know if I can do this anymore. ",,,

It's gotten even worse since then, with her flying into a rage every morning about something I did or didn't do. Yesterday it was because I had forgotten to light the mosquito coils by the back door. The day before it was because I had been playing with our son rather than washing the dishes (of which there were about three dirty plates). Shes yelled point blank that I ""disgust"" her and that she ""hates"" me. It's exhausting and distressing, and if it was just me, I'd have left long ago.

But we have a 3yo child who I adore and he adores me. I spend basically every moment outside of work caring and raising him. We even coslept together. But for the past few months my wife has been accusing me of being an unfit and negligent parent. Her reasons, in my opinion, are trivial, like missing a patch of skin while applying sunscreen or packing the wrong coloured hat in his daycare bag, but she considers my errors life-endangering, either because she is neurotic or because she's intentionally trying to position herself as the primary carer if we seperate.

The thought of having to stay in a hostile relationship fills me with dread, but the thought of only seeing my son half the week or less is worse. My worst nightmare is that I move out a my wife cuts off all contact between me and my son. I don't have the money to take her to court, and even if I did, a trial could take months or even years, by which time my son might not even recognise me.

Anyway, I dont expect anyone to have a solution. I just thought I'd share, and maybe give some insight into why some people stay in abusive or unhappy relationships. Thanks.",,,

About 1 yr later … and the mask has completely fallen off - I can see the relationship for what it truly is: abuse, point blank. No sugar coating it. I can see that I do not love this person and we are not “soul-mates” or “cosmically intertwined”, I am in a trauma bond. I’ve lost a lot of myself, become isolated, fearful, and above all just so gd exhausted - but I’m not done fighting. Even with this clarity, I’m having trouble formulating an actionable plan to escape- just to a hotel for 1 night or 2 to rest, to breathe for a second. To make the calls I need to and to re-connect with my local DV organizations to help me secure stable housing amongst other resources. Im ready to leave, I’m packed, but I have reasonable and genuine fear that if I go while my abuser is home something bad may happen, and I’m experiencing major brain fog & issues with my executive functioning in general. Sometimes I will just lock myself in the bathroom and literally do nothing for an hour or two bc I’ve been in survival mode so long it’s like I’m paralyzed sometimes. Im planning on reaching out to a DV advocate through text but im worried even with writing this I’m being monitored. He’s not psychologically well and prone to paranoia and psychotic episodes. I’m in the Midwest in a rural town 1,000 miles away from my entire family and everything I’ve ever known - my parents don’t understand the full scope of the situation - hell I don’t even think I fully grasp what the hell is happening to me right now. Currently there is an active no contact order protecting me from him, but when I was evicted I had no where else to go … or at least felt that way … I’m trespassed from this property, and he’s been charged with assaulting me (which prompted the no contact) but then we had a situation in which I had to spend a night in jail as well as him for violating my own no contact. So it creates this environment where I’m scared to call anyone for help or report it because I really don’t want to go back to jail, it was one of the worst experiences aside from the abuse that I’ve had. My charges got dropped. Also - he got me a cat pretty much as soon as we met, she’s been through all of it right by me. She’s sits on my chest and purrs when I have panic attacks, and sometimes the fact that she is excited to see me when I come home from work or wake up in the morning is the only nice and kind thing that happens to me all day. She’s family, it would literally tear my soul in half to leave her behind. It doesn’t feel like an option. But I’m willing to be realistic and make a hard decision if i have to. Deciding to leave is a hard thing, but I can do this. We can get out. I’ve secured a small short term loan from a local credit union and I sell clothes on Depop to generate some more income but my financial situation is dire. No savings, ~$550 in the bank, $40 cash, I have cat food and litter, my ID and cards, my laptop (broken charger I have to get replaced) some toiletries, and anything sentimental that isn’t too big to carry. I took the next week off after this Friday (03/14/25) when I have a shift at a local coffee shop. I don’t have a vehicle and im in an Uber desert essentially with one singular taxi that only drives within the city limit or else it’s sort of expensive. I’ve looked at a couple options on Turo for a truck/car for a day or two but I have limited funds. I’m struggling to put the pieces together, but staying is only making it worse. So - shot in the dark time. Any advice, tips, tricks, guidance, encouragement…. Anything and everything helps. ",,,
1j9g263,Is Empathy that hard?,MistakenlyMustard,6,2025-03-12 09:23:08+00:00,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j9g263/is_empathy_that_hard/,"I really just need to vent. 

I just escaped a years long relationship where strangling was the go to abuse. Which, through the police and therapy I’ve learned is the type of abuse that more often than not leads to homicide so I’m so glad I’m out.

But I digress. 

I had to do a larger than normal grocery run, and I am now a single mom so obviously I needed to bring my son. I’m in a location that the only family around to help watch him is my ex’s family so that was a no go.

So, due to previous experiences, I HAD TO put my son in the main compartment of the cart. No if, ands, or buts, it had to be that way for my freshly out of trauma, single mom brain to not have the hell raising toddler in the middle of a grocery store screaming that he “doesn’t want to sit there” and “let me go” for an hour, which garners aggressively judgmental looks. And the 10 trips we’d taken previously were without incident simply because I let him sit in the bottom part of the cart.

As you can tell, this one was NOT without incident, but I did not know that at the time. 

To my surprise, my son and I completed our entire grocery store shopping experience with joy and random sing-a-long’s and queued up to an empty cashing lane, to which I was met with, “if you don’t have your own bags, do you want some but you’re going to have to pay for them” to which I met with a “I have my own bags!” But then looked into the cart and realized all of my items were on top of them so I had to empty the cart (that still contained my happy son) onto the conveyor belt to get to my reusable bags. 

She huffed and puffed, refusing to scan a single item until I had reached the bags, whilst I’m apologizing profusely, calling myself stupid, and she’s just huffing and rolling her eyes. 

I have everything finally precariously placed as my son looks on in wonder as I rip the bags out from under the last remnants of the items we had joyously gathered together. 

She finally slacks and asks me to donate $1 to whatever charity, at which at that point I went “sure, whatever, that’s fine” in hopes she’d be somewhat less hostile. 

However it continued and she demanded all the items in the bottom of my cart have their barcodes pointed upwards so she didn’t have to help, so….without realizing my son was standing up at the end of the cart, I pulled the cart towards me to adjust and then everything went slow motion.

I see my toddler toppling backwards out of the cart, back of the head into the floor. I’m trapped in the cash out lane between my cart, the person behind me and that damned conveyor belt. My eyes go wide, my son is screaming, I can’t reach him, but by the grace of god, the teen in the next lane over can reach him and lifts him into the cart so I can reach him. I hold him, he’s crying, and I realize she’s 4/5 through my order so I tell her to finish because I won’t be making this trip again and refuse to restart it the next time as I was checking over my son.

She’s huffing and puffing all over again, muttering how I should just leave and go to the ER. I already KNEW my night would be spent in the ER, but what SHE didn’t know is that I had been previously trained and worked as an EMT, so I knew 1) he didn’t loose consciousness, 2) he wasn’t vommitting, and 3) he was completely coherent and acting like my simply shocked from getting hurt son. So finish my order, we’ll check out, I’ll frantically drop it at home and grab all the things I need from home to make him comfortable because I know ER visits aren’t quick and let me go.

So I finish finally, and walk out but a lady from inside chases me down and reminds me to do an incident report in case he’s more injured than expected. 

I may seem apathetic rn but I was in a horrored shock during all of this. I was beating myself up over finishing the order, over moving the cart that caused him to fall, over being the horrible mom that let him in the lower part of the cart instead of dealing with the screaming for strapping him into the child safe seat. I was horrified. 

But I walked back in with him to do a quick report before the long night ahead. 

To his credit, the manager was so sweet, he was helping me fill it out as my son kept stating how he hurt and had a headache and I sped through the paperwork. But then SHE walked up and went “why the hell is she filing a report?!” She turns to me and goes “you know it’s YOUR fault this happened right?”
I said “yes, that’s what I was finishing writing in the report, so don’t talk to me”
She continued about how I was going to try to sue the grocery store and I was a bad mom…..and to be honest, the thought NEVER crossed my mind to sue because I was simply filing the report so it was there and SHE is the one that made me want to. 
She kept spouting about how I didn’t care about my son and finally the manager came back with my copy of the report and I left.

 Luckily, after spending almost 7 hrs in the ER, we found out he’s ok. Which was made easier from the stop at home to get his favorite plushies and tablet and snacks. Obviously if he had been worse off I would have dropped everything and ran out of the store with my son to the hospital. 

But right off rip she was a dick for no reason, then attacked me afterwards. 

My philosophy is that you never know what someone is going through so why treat people like shit right off the bat. You literally have to earn my ire. 
I shouldn’t have to enter an establishment and go “hey, my child and I were abused for years and just got out of it and I have trauma disassociation and memory loss so if I don’t react appropriately to traumatic situations, forgive me”.

Ps, talked to her corporate office and stated that I would never want anyone to lose their means of income and maybe just do some training on customer service and empathy.
Because there was no reason for her to run up as I’m making a report as I’m basically crying and telling me it’s all my fault and telling me what a horrible mother I am because my son fell out of a shopping cart.",,,

He doesn’t do this regularly but when he does he binges for days and does absolutely ridiculous dangerous things. Yesterday he spent the whole day at multiple different bars and it was day 2 of his binge and I didn’t want me 26f (8 months pregnant) or my child 2f around it so when I got off work I went to our house grabbed our things and went up to my mother in laws house (she lives right in front of our house on the same property) this is something I do when he gets like this to avoid conflict. His mom and I went to where he was and took his vehicle so he could not drive it & we drove it home. His phone was in the vehicle and his mother brought it in the house. This is normal and he usually doesn’t even notice and just gets his phone once he’s sober. This time was different though usually he just goes home passes out and the next day when he sobers up we talk he apologizes and we go home and he does work on this behavior. This time though he came up to my mother in laws house and at the time he showed up I was alone with my child in the home. He went around the house banging on all the windows screaming nonsense and kicking things over all over the place. I heard him wanting his phone and I wanted to just give it to him but he was acting so scary and I was alone with my child so I just kept the doors and windows locked and told him to go home and go to bed and went to a safe area with my child until my mil and fil got home. When they got home they started talking with him and he was just arguing saying obsurtities about me and that he wanted his phone so I walked out the door a bit closer to him and threw his phone towards him and told him to go home. His phone hit the ground and shattered and was unusable. He seemed to just see red he was furious I went back inside and my fil came inside and I was scared that he was going to go home and hurt my cat in our house. (I know now I shouldn’t have gone and this was stupid) He was still on the porch screaming when I decided I had enough time to just go to my house and grab my cat since he was on foot and I was going to be in my car. I left my child with my fil, I drove down to my house ran inside grabbed my cat and as I was getting in my car he slammed the front door causing the cat to get startled and jump out of my arms and run onto our porch trying to get in the door I went to the door grabbed him and next thing I know my husband had pushed me to the porch ground, I had my cat in my arms and was crouched over him in fetal position screaming please stop I’m leaving please don’t hurt me he kicked me on my back I peed my pants and before he could do anything else I was able to get my cat and I in the car and back to my in laws. 
He has never physically hurt me before and I do not know how to deal with this situation now. I am being told we are both at fault because I should not have thrown and shattered his phone. I feel as if breaking his phone is not comparable to being physically hurt by him or a reason I should have been hurt by him. I do feel bad about breaking his phone and have said I would take care of replacing it but ive had multiple people now tell me that I warranted the physical behavior and was in the wrong as well.

I told him yes, in January which I showed the cop a video of my ex choking me. He told me an investigator would reach out to me. He sent me a link to submit evidence of my bruises which I did.
2 days later the investigator calls me to meet him at the station, I go and basically he has me explain both January and February incidents from start to finish to him also he sent me the link to where I provided evidence from both days. Picture of my bruises, video of the choking and text threads. That day he also had a girl police take additional pictures of the bruises on my body. I informed the investigator my ex states I hit him but I can’t recall if I did or did not in the January incident where he choked me in the video.
After meeting with him I emailed him recanting my statement and cooperation with the investigation, that I’m not pursuing charges nor a protection order.  He called me to verify my ex hadn’t contacted me to change my mind. I reassured him no we are not in contact and I did not feel threatened in any way. He stated in the email he would note my decision on the report.
From a mutual friend 2 days later I was told my ex met with the investigator but basically he focused on asking him about the physical parts only not the whole story from start to finish like he had me do. He left and was told to submit evidence on the link as well. He stated to our mutual friend that he submitted a picture of a bite mark on his back done from me in the January incident but I truly don’t recall doing that. I can’t confirm nor deny. (Note: both incidents I did tell the investigator we had been drinking those days) he says the investigator has not contacted to ask him about the picture of the bite mark on his back because my ex didn’t remember about the mark until after he had already left from meeting with the investigator. That same week my ex got a lawyer and they just sent the investigator a letter stating they are representing him. The investigator has not reached out to me either. It has been about 3 1/2 weeks already. 
I called the DA victim advocate office in the courthouse they stated they didn’t have my case # on file and that since no arrest had been made they would reject the case that it’s up to the police department to make the arrest and that is how they get involved. I told her the investigator told me he will submit the case to the prosecutor and they would decide if the case gets picked up or not. That he said it’s not up to the PD but the state so I’m now confused in all this ",,,

I was in an abusive marriage and my ex husband would grab my arms and leave bruises when he would get angry and yell at me. I have a feeling this is now happening to my oldest son. My nine year old came home with bruises on the back of his arm again. A couple of months ago, he one in the front of his arm and it looked like a thumb print to me. My son said he couldn’t remember and then switched and said it was from running into something at school. This week he has more bruises but on the back of his upper arm, at first he said it was from dad grabbing him and then switched to falling down the stairs. I only have two photos and a video of these bruises. Is this enough to fight for custody or a restraining order if my son says he cannot remember/changes the story?

1j9bnzf,Fleeing domestic violence in Los Angeles,DivineLove777777,1,2025-03-12 05:02:07+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j9bnzf/fleeing_domestic_violence_in_los_angeles/,"I’m in a really tough situation and need advice. My shelter is closing on June 30 because LAHSA pulled their grant due to fraud. Instead of rehousing us, they’re just telling us to “get income” to qualify for a PATH subsidy. Originally, we were told the subsidy would cover the deposit and part of the rent for the first year, tapering off gradually. Now, they’re only covering the deposit.

I was laid off while at the shelter and went on General Relief (GR) as advised by my case manager. But now she’s giving me the runaround, and since my GR is ending soon, I no longer qualify for housing assistance through it.

I’ve been in the shelter for almost a year, and I’m beyond my breaking point—mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I don’t feel safe here. I even had to issue a cease-and-desist to the main site coordinator for verbally assaulting and harassing me. I’ve never been homeless before; I’m here because I’m fleeing domestic violence.

Recently, I got an offer for a fully remote state job—my dream job. I’ve been applying for months, and this is the only offer I’ve received. But I have nowhere to set up an office, store paperwork, or hang professional clothes for video calls. The department hasn’t confirmed whether I need a hardline internet connection either. My car is literally my only space.

Now, my case manager suddenly tells me LAHSA has a housing program for people with mental health diagnoses. I got documentation from my therapist confirming PTSD and depression, plus verification of my physical disability. She says this should make me eligible, but she doesn’t know when LAHSA will get back to me. I’ve been here for a year—why is she just now telling me about this when she’s known I’m fleeing domestic violence?

PATH is income-based, so I don’t qualify until I start working. I filed a grievance with LAHSA about the shelter closing with no rehousing plan, and they were shocked. They said it’s against their policy to exit people without a plan. The person I spoke to said she’d look into it, but I haven’t heard anything since. Apparently, the shelter was supposed to find a new grant, not shut down entirely.

When I tried to push for answers, the site coordinator basically mocked me and told me I should be “looking for housing.” How am I supposed to do that when they withhold info about internal programs? I also went to the Department of Mental Health for help, and they told me they don’t do housing—yet people from my shelter have gotten apartments through them, with rent covered and Section 8 vouchers, even though they weren’t fleeing DV or disabled.

I’m supposed to be on the emergency housing list for DV survivors and disabled individuals, but I have no confirmation that’s actually happening. I also reached out to D.A.R.T. about DV housing, and they were supposed to follow up with me today, but I haven’t heard back.

I feel like I’ve exhausted every possible option. Does anyone have viable suggestions? I have to take this state job, but I don’t know how I’m supposed to succeed without stable housing.",,,

We have technically stayed together during this time but ultimately over the last 2 weeks I felt very confident in my choice to break up with him, I had hard days with normal feelings of heartbreak but I knew I would be ending the relationship. I wasn’t sure when or how but I knew I was ready and I was slowly detaching from him and us. 

This past weekend we went to a wedding out of town for his brother (none of his family knows about the abuse or any of our business) and it was an amazing weekend and now, since the incident that happened in the beginning of February- I feel attracted and truly attached and in love with him again. He has been dedicated to me and making things work after everything that happened and I never reciprocated those feelings until now. I know we can’t be together and it can never work out realistically, especially because of the fact my friends and family know about the abuse and I know I can truly find a healthy love one day. But I can’t help but feel back in a headspace/ trauma bond that I thought I had grown from. 

Is this a normal thing to happen in abusive relationships? Is there a possibility I can get back to the mindset I was in before this weekend? 

I’m turning 25 in a few months and don’t want to waste more time with someone I know I can never be with but I’m still so in love and attached to him as I thought he was going to be the man I married. ",,,
1j96yzs,I've put up with this shit for 12 years.,Existing_Phase1644,1,2025-03-12 01:01:33+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j96yzs/ive_put_up_with_this_shit_for_12_years/,"For context, I live with my folks. My step-dad is hard of hearing, and my mother is an A type personality with a history of domestic abuse that was trained into her as a kid. I, myself, don't drive, have a difficult time finding work of any kind, and at 40, post attempt, with PTSD, just livethrough this continued hell.   
Day after fucking day.  
We walk around on egg shells because who knows what the fuck is goingto set her off. She lashes out whenever she feels like it, saying it's back talk whenever I have a conversation with her, or whenever she hears something she doesn't like.   
She pushes him around a lot, insults, degrades, punches, slaps him, justifies it by saying his mother did the same to me once, or if her mother or father were at the house, we'd be getting our asses whooped, but since they aren't, she will.   
She's only hit me a few times, mainly because I put a stop to it for a while, and the last time i simply let her, because it was kind of justified. Ate more than I was supposed to.   
I've basically stopped talking in general, stopped trying to figure out a way to get my life on track, battling with light to medium depression, and just focus on what's in front of me. She tends to start arguments for no reason other than to try and start an argument, threatens homelessness and yeah, my resume isn't the greatest.   
I hate living here, but I don't have anywhere to go.   
Since I've failed to get into the military she's been verbally and emotionally abusive,  manipulative, and randomly starts screaming throughout the house.   
I get it. 

I'm 40, should have my life on track at this point. But that's still no excuse to hit me or her husband and then get offended when we call her out on it. I've gotten numb to it, no point in letting what she does to me both directly or indirectly affect me anymore then it already has.

There was a moment, just weeks after I had gotten ack, after I had broken up with my girlfriend at the time, where I really needed someone to talk to, it was a mental spiral that really fucked with my head. I tried approaching her, but she said she didn't have time for me. The next few moments after she left were a blur, thankfully, the attempt didn't take. 

now a days? I just try to get through the day as blank minded as possible. I don't date, I don't invite people over, I don't go to the campus. I just sit around waiting for a heart attack to take me so I don't have to live through this fucking hell anymore.   
I'm alive for some reason, still. But I don't think god or whoever made the right choice in letting me live. At least, that's how i felt back then. Now a days, I just.... try not to think at all. ",,,

Trying to see him as one person, the good, the bad, the ugly… all of it happened with one man. It feels as if I had a great relationship with this great guy and then, in a whole separate lifetime almost, I had a horrible relationship with a horrible guy. It truly was all one. I think once I am able to unite the whole thing it will be easier to move on. But it’s just so hard to do; my brain can’t reconcile that the same guy who moved mountains for me also pushed me down them. He was my abuser and my best friend. He was kind and evil. He is not all one thing or the other and I hope once I can get that to stick, I will feel more secure in moving on. Can anyone relate? ",,,
1j90z9v,healthy mechanisms to stay away from my abusive ex,No-Vegetable-8450,3,2025-03-11 20:38:31+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j90z9v/healthy_mechanisms_to_stay_away_from_my_abusive_ex/,"Hi everyone, I’m hoping someone could give me a bit of advice. I feel very stuck. I have been in a abusive relationship for about five years now. 


The last year has been the best year I have made a lot of steps forward. Cutting contact a lot of the time for maybe a month, two months at a time but I always end up going back, the cycle usually starts as okay will be friends and then the friendship starts to become possessive, he’ll usually will turn into the person that is abusive, mentally questioning me about everything who I’m with what I’m doing, isolating me from having a life outside him things like that. 

The issue that seems to keep me stuck is that I seem to want to still be civilised with him or on talking terms? Or that I feel like I don’t want him to see me in this bad light? 

I feel like verbally he has always been so hard with accusations on cheating and other guys that I feel the need to be this ‘good girl’ and prove that I’m not out or with anyone else- this will include us staying in contact and just being friends but him feeling the need to know inner details about my personal life. 

For example, we aren’t speaking momentarily because I went to see a physio and he flipped the lid because it was a man. 

I can’t live like that, I won’t live like that. 
But I really struggle with not reaching out to nearly fix his perception or getting him to understand why I’m innocent. 

I really hope this resonates with someone, I’ve been in therapy, doing amazing work on myself and know I will come out the other side of this and finally cut the cord. 

I think with this post I’m really looking for coping mechanisms in the mean time, things to not make me feel awful and keep me from contacting him to ensure that he knows I’m a ‘good girl’ as such. 


I’ve came such a long way from reactive abuse and the girl I used to be would be so proud, I just feel so stuck on these end parts and trying to fix these bad habits. I’m nearly 1000% sure he knows what he’s doing by this silent treatment and accusations because he knows it’s the only way to reach me.

Thanks for letting me post this and vent. And I really appreciate anything that might give me some help with this. ",,,

Me and my other siblings have helped her get out of the house. He is still there with his wife who is probably also abused but is also verbally attacking everyone. Local authorities have been called, APS, Mental Services Mobile Crisis and Sheriff. Sheriff did NOTHING. Basically just told them to stay away from each other. Mobile crisis says it’s in sheriffs hands and APS just gave us numbers.

He messed with her car where she is staying at her friend’s house, so it’s still a problem. 

Should I bother to keep trying to get authorities to respond? Or just get her a new apartment and leave it alone? We don’t want him to go to jail, we just want him to get treatment, but neither is happening. I am always scared cops will make it worse not better because that has been my experience. She doesn’t want to deal with a restraining order because of the court aspect, time, and she has to work, move and is scheduled to have a surgery soon.

Well Anyways skip forward a few months from that conversation and were out drinking and I'm already alittle over tipsy and that conversation comes up again. This time being alittle drunk I told them that I didn't know if I would or wouldn't have a 3 sum with them. We'll they continued to buy me drinks throughout the night until I was so drunk I couldn't walk and had to use there arms to help me up. We'll we get back to there place and ended up hooking up. The next morning I left and just went home. We never really talked about it again and technically I said yes but I was also really drunk. Now I just can't get it out of my mind we have hung out multiple times since then and nothing has happened. But was I taken advantage of? Is this considered rape since you can't constant while drunk? I would have never done it sober and feel ashamed about what happened and that i continue to hangout with them. But shes my best friend since we were little and i dont have anyone else I talk to.

We have been together since the 21 April 2024 and I've been the only one who worked to this day.

Even if i have quit my job on July i still managed to sell item (my loved Pokemon card collection or Hunter x Hunter collection, vr headset, Nintendo switch and a lot of stuff) to buy food and other stuff like theater or date together.

But recently i have nothing much to sell and couldn't get a job (live in France) so we just eat bread with nothing else.

And he have helped us with max 50€ worth of groceries since April 2024.

He we're kicked out of is house because tbh we are ""not like usual couple"" cuz we are 2 men that love each other i guess, so this isn't a simple situation (is mother is horrible she never said hello or thx you to me).

But after that safe place that my parents and i offered to im, and all i have done he keep saying me to get a job and 1 hour ago he just told me in front of my mother that this is MY PARENTS that's feeding him and not me, like i never done it before, at cost of what i have worked for to afford and cherish (god i miss my collections), he even add that he loss 3killograme in a week (cuz we don't eat so much) but said it like it's my fault.

I know i'm not perfect, like no one is.
But I've always do my best and i don't know what to do and worst of it, I'm starting to think i don't do enough even if i got nothing to give anymore.

I just feel that I'm been used, what I can't bring my self to believe.

He is also very unpleasant with me for no reason sometimes and insulting me freely (i do it too, but not that much and mostly just to respond to is aggressiveness)

He used a lot of ""then i broke up with you"" emotional blackmail.

And everytime we argue it goes really far and 2 time i told him to leave he just hit me and slap me.

I could add more details but i feel like i said to much and i just need answers to this question.

I'm i doing enough ?

Does abuse of me financially ?

What should i do or what i could do or he could do to get this better ?

The relationship and relationship advice told me le to post this here so i do

Im afraid the next time i will told I'm he do the same btw.",,,

Over these two years, she’s become one of my closest friends, and at this point we’ve both admitted that it’s become more than that really. For context, I work a part-time job and she is also one of my coworkers. One day she showed up to work with CLEAR signs of a physical altercation happening between her and her bf (bruising under the eye), and since that day I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. This was about 8 months ago. Around the same time, my roommate was moving out so I was gonna have an open room in my apartment. I ended up telling her that if she ever needs a place to go for a night or to even move into that she is absolutely welcome, and she pretty much said yes on the spot, but warned me that it would take a long time for her to be ready. 

Since then, she’s told me more about her situation. She ran away from home and moved in with this guy when she was 16, and mind you, this vile dude was my age when he had her do that so not only is he an abuser, he’s a groomer. He constantly insults her, tells her she’s useless and that he hates her and doesn’t even want her around, so the abuse goes beyond physical as well. From what she’s told me, there is nothing left but a trauma bond in their relationship, and she tells me everyday how she can’t wait for it to be over. 

Currently, she still wants to move in with me whenever she can, and I’ve made sure she’s still comfortable with that plan. I try not to push her to do it too hard because I know just dropping everything in your life and leaving on a dime is no small choice, and as well as that I know she’s trying to avoid doing the same thing that got her into that situation in the first place. I guess what I need guidance on is, what can I do besides just wait? Should I get the police involved if I ever see a physical sign like that again? Should I be encouraging her more? Will I be putting myself, or worse her in danger by inserting myself into her life like that? I’m 21 and never been in a situation like this so I may be in over my head trying to help, but I see so much of myself in this person that it hurts me more to watch and not do anything about it.",,,
1j8uxcc,Reporting my ex partner for sexual abuse,AggressivePassion835,1,2025-03-11 16:31:18+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j8uxcc/reporting_my_ex_partner_for_sexual_abuse/,"*TW: sexual assault, grooming*

I (24F) know that I should contacted the police regarding this situation, but it’s more complicated since it mostly involves coercion and sexual abuse so I’m unsure if what he (34M) has done is basically a crime. I don’t really have much proof in my end either since I have him blocked off everything, and I later consented only to please him. I’ve also had another former partner of this person speak to me regarding an incident where he was choking her out, and she thought about contacting police but never took action; I’m not really sure if I want to speak directly to police agencies since I later gave in to what he did towards me even though I never verbally consented what he did to me (long story short, he’s into hard BDSM, rape fantasy scenarios, and humiliation kinks in which the second time we had sex he just put this onto me without warning).

This situation is also extremely complicated and fucked since I’ve known this person “Foley” since I was 17 (2017) We met at this retail store I worked at, and he was 27 at the time; we didn’t start becoming friends at least until I was 18 by the time I was in college. By the time I left college at 22 (2022), we started hanging out and during that time we began seeing each other again for 6 months. But we was still inflicting these weird kinks, and I only stayed because I loved him and wanted him to stay. I broke things off with him because I found out that he was in a 2 years relationship with someone else (“I”) in which she told me more about his behavior including when he choked her out.

Recently around last August, Foley reached out to “make amends” but only for us to resume seeing each other romantically. But it was only for 4 months, and honestly things became worse; the last time we saw each other, I had a traumatic sexual experience with him which led to me finally cutting things off and blocking him for good.

I’m now realizing the fact that his behavior was abusive and the grieving process has been tough. Some days I’m okay, but then I find myself crying and feeling helpless because I don’t know what to do or what action to take against him. I go to therapy to talk about everything, in which my therapist suggested that I should possibly speak to authorities about this. But with what proof? I literally have nothing to show, and I feel like a lot of things would be used against me since I reconciled with him the 2nd time and later consented to everything afterwards. I’m not sure if it’s a grooming type situation, but he would often comment during sex that he’s wanted me since I was 17 and it’s just fucking weird and disturbing. He would say how much I was “in love” with him at this time, but it was only a crush. We barely knew each other or were even close the first year we worked together.

I feel awful because he’s also in a situation in which he’s possibly at risk of getting deported, and part of me wants to submit a tip no matter how fucked up it sounds (if anything, that’s the last thing I’d want to do). Overall, I feel extremely helpless and I don’t want to face rejection from authorities from the fact that I don’t have much to show  on my end.

*update: I contacted my local police district and they suggested for me to come in to speak to an officer. As for them pressing charges and something actually being done, it depends on whether a detective would be able to accept my case*",,,

Just feeling alone and hoping to hear from someone out there. I've been with my husband since 2020. He's always been controlling/possessive, we started as a long distance relationship and I thought things would ease up when he knew that I was fully invested in him. As time has passed, the verbal abuse is still there, but physical abuse grew as well. I'm in another country with him alone, and I'm just sad. I feel like he took everything from me. I don't really have friends anymore or anyone to talk to. Right now I'm at a hotel, I'm staying here until I get paid and can afford a ticket to go home, not for another week. He always blames everything on me and says that I take no responsibility for anything. We had a perfect month, and once my period starts everything blows up. It's hard for me to take the verbal abuse when I feel emotional. I feel guilty for fighting back. I feel guilty that he says I ruined everything and wasted so many years. I feel heartbroken because I love him anyways. I can't stop crying, and I always question myself. What if I just found a better way to swallow it all? Maybe it would all stop. We had so many dreams for the future. We were going to move to my country. I still question how much better life would be if we did. Where I could be the one to have more of a lead. Maybe then he would see the real me more and not think I'm stupid, and lazy, and pathetic, and a piece of shit. It's hard for me to do things here, I don't speak the language, and he always says I'm just lazy and don't push him to go out and do stuff together. I know I don't deserve it, but I know I'm not innocent either. I want kids, I want a family, I feel like I'm wasting my life trying to get things to be better when I know they won't. I feel hopeless and crushed. I just don't see anything positive right now and really need some help. I love him through it all, but I know I'm just stupid.

He is abusive, we lived with him once before and he has hit her multiple times during and since then, he is not allowed at our house. My mom went on a trip and was coming home later that night, so in the morning I had to go over my house to help my grandmother get the kids ready for school. I walked past my living room in the complete dark because I know my house and I was going to say hi to my grandma and I hear, “PSSST get over here”. I thought it was my brother at first trying to surprise me, but it was my step dad. He started asking me where my mother was and I really did not know. He said “Stop playing. Where is she and who is she with.” She never told me, she told me she was going on a work trip and I don’t usually question her because she’s an adult and she can do whatever, but I’m assuming she didn’t tell me in case he tried to contact me and ask. I was terrified. I really think he thought I was my mom coming home and he was sitting there lurking in the dark going to hurt me. I got my grandmother quietly and asked if she knew he was here, she did not. So he snuck into my house. She went and talked to him, idk what she said but I think she mentioned the police so he left. I was shaking, it really felt like he was going to hurt me because he thought I was my mom, and because he thought I was my mom he started taking his anger out on me. While my grandma was talking to him, I was texting my boyfriend who I asked to stay down the road just in case something happened- I wanted to leave because I’ve seen that man hurt my mother before, and I think it caused me to have a really bad panic attack so I asked my grandma if it was alright and I left. When we got down the road, I saw him walking, so he was still near my house. He was spam texting me to tell my mother to call him and saying “This isn’t going to end well for anyone” and basically now threatening me. I don’t even know anymore. I’m so hurt, he used to see me as a daughter. It’s like when he confused me as my mom, something switched and he turned his anger on me. I’m also not sure if it’s the fact that I’m an adult now? I’m terrified for my mom’s life. I know he won’t hurt the kids, but I’m afraid he’s going to try to take them away somehow. I’m now scared he’s going to hit me too.

How do I cope with leaving my life and items behind to escape? Shelters don't allow me to bring my items with me, only the bare miniumin.


I know people say your life is more important than items but I have to get rid of things that matter to me that I won't be able to get back. I know freedom will be worth it but it really hurts right now.

She was telling me about an encounter that she had with some guy apparently he assaulted her, which is a terrible thing to hear coming from somebody that I love it broke my heart for her, and he was also at the bar that we were at, and I went to get up to pull up my pants and as I was getting up, I said, are you serious after she told me that he was at the bar and she put her hand around my throat very tight and slammed me down into the chair and my head hit the brick wall like just bounced off of it not anything crazy and she said quotations don’t you fucking get up. It honestly scared me so bad I looked at her and I asked what the fuck was wrong with her and why the fuck did she just do that? I kept saying you did not just do that and she looked at me and said all I do is fuck everything up and she walked away to go talk to one of her friends When I tell you to look in her eyes was not my girlfriend. It was some evil entity it was full of pure hatred and it scared the shit out of me. I already went through domestic violence before with a 6 foot four man so she does not scare me, but the look in her eyes terrified me because it was just pure hatred. The bouncer then came over to me after she walked away and asked if I wanted him to throw her out. And I said no she was absolutely hammered so I just let it go, but it threw me into a flashback and I’ve been feeling fucking sick ever since.


EDIT: 
Her excuse for that behavior was because apparently I like when she chokes me, but what she did was not in a sexual way in the slightest",,,

Minnesota lawmakers propose introducing a bold new bill, the Freedom Against Interpersonal Reproductive Entrapment (FAIRE) Act, which aims to address coerced parenthood as a form of domestic abuse. The law would allow individuals who feel trapped in a forced pregnancy, surrogacy, or adoption to seek ex parte protective orders—similar to restraining orders in domestic violence cases—to block or stop the process.

Supporters argue that forced parenthood can be just as psychologically damaging as physical abuse, leading to depression, suicide, and mental health crises. The bill would offer immediate legal relief, allowing courts to issue orders preventing one partner from coercing another into becoming a parent against their will.

Critics, however, worry about due process concerns, potential misuse, and even claims that the law could lead to state-mandated abortions in extreme cases. The bill's broad language raises questions about how these orders would be enforced, including whether law enforcement could intervene in an ongoing pregnancy.

Does this law go too far, or is it a necessary step in protecting people from reproductive coercion? Should forced parenthood be treated as a form of domestic abuse?

One of the women who works there frequently has injuries that have included black eyes, a broken wrist, burst blood vessels in her eyes, and various bruises. It seems like every time I go in there, she's hurt, and I don't pry beyond expressing casual concern. She always has a story that seems plausible - fell down the stairs, got in a car accident, etc.

When we were at the store two weeks ago, she couldn't speak above a raspy whisper and claimed it was laryngitis. I have heard before that strangulation is a huge escalation in domestic violence and I fear for this woman's safety. But I also don't want to make accusations or assumptions when I really have no knowledge. Is there anything I can do to help her?

Don't know if this matters, but she is an immigrant and likely in her early 60s. I don't know anything more than that, but I recognize there could be factors I have absolutely no idea about that could make all of this even trickier.

Thank you.

Added for clarification: She speaks very good English and we communicate quite well. I just don't know what the cultural or legal issues could be surrounding this and I don't want to potentially cause her more trouble by blundering in without understanding.

We have some slight issues, he still has no career goals/no drive, the jealousy issues have been a work in progress but have gotten significantly better. I could go into more detail regarding those issues but the most recent event is what I need advice on. When my BF drinks he has always become more jealous, incoherent, not recognizable etc. When drinking together it typically ends with him getting mad, me crying or me crying because I think he is upset, obviously I realize this is my anxiety from the past times we've drank. Typically, the morning after these events I start to gaslight myself about why I was so upset as the alcohol hurts the memory, although I remember the feelings being real last night I typically question the details which makes me less confident of my emotions so we both apologize have conversation and feel better. 

Last halloween (2024) my sister (F23) my BF and I went out, my sister and I were at a table talking to some guys, my BF saw this and I waved him over, he has this face like I had murdered his mother. I instantly try to shut this down cause I can't handle it, long story short he was insanely hammered (not an excuse) and pushed me hard into a hightop, tried to come after me again and my sister got in between him and I. I had my hands in my hair stressed and he commented I hope you rip it out. He had never been physical while drunk with me before at this point, the next morning he can't remember so I tell him. He starts to cry, apologize etc, we discuss recognizing limits. I tell him if it happens again I will leave him but all in all I end up comforting him then forgiving and forgetting. 

3 days ago it happened again, I asked him to sober up while I was outside waiting with my friend till their ride came, I come back and he obviously worse. Later, I explain I was just sad and wished he had sobered up when I asked. He kept claiming he had nothing wrong, once I was ready for bed I told him I was headed up and he ignored me then called his friends inviting them over. As I am grabbing the rest of my things to head to the bedroom, he tells me he is tired of this. With that I finally loose control over my emotions, i start to cry and tell him he is being very mean and I head upstairs and lock the door behind me. 3 minutes later he is knocking, his sister is sleeping in the room over and I was nervous he was going to wake her up so I crack it and very calmly tell him i'm going to sleep alone tonight, or I can even more to the other bedroom and he can have this one, that I just need space. He begins to tell me I should be the one alone, I am a waste of his time and tells me he wont talk to me when I go on my trip, I explain that isn't what I said and I just need some space, he then switches me and asks me to leave him alone during my trip and leaves. 2 minutes later he is back but more aggressively shaking the knob then banging, i crack the door at this point he aggressively bodies the door open hitting me and asking me ""whos in here?"" I am starting to cry again and keep repeating ""please leave, please just leave"" I try pushing to just get him out of the doorway, he won't move and is silent. Now I am scared and shakily still begging him to leave, as an attempt to scare him I say ""I am going to call my parents"", he starts smiling and laughing in my face and eventually does leave the room after I stop talking, he calls me a bitch as I shut and lock the door. I had to call my dad to come get me, while he went back out, lost his phone and was even walked home by the cops. Before he lost the phone he was sending miss spelled texts, that he can't figure me out and I am a mistake. 

He doesn't remember this the next morning, says he is sorry if he disrespected me and that he thought we had a goodnight. After explaining what happened, he tells me he is sorry, how he is disgusted with himself etc. I leave for a 2 week europe trip today with my sister, I told him we could talk more when I get back. I know I should end it, I know these are signs, I am just terrified of the hurt, I genuinely love him, we have a great relationship aside from the drinking, he is my best friend, so kind and loving when sober. I guess I just want advice from people who don't know us or has been through something similar, as well as possible advice for ending it/getting through the breakup.

1j8eixd,Feeling inadequate years later,Ok_Programmer4685,3,2025-03-11 00:50:21+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j8eixd/feeling_inadequate_years_later/,"I’ve been single since leaving a really abusive and traumatic relationship almost 5 years ago. The relationship prior was also abusive but I was a teen and it wasn’t really love, so it’s safe to say I’ve never really been loved.

I’m in my early 30s now and though I’m content most of the time in my solitude I want to find someone to share life with. 

I downloaded some dating apps and as I’m scrolling I’m seeing some really great guys, ones I have a lot in common with- but I can’t help feeling that every single one of them is out of my league. They’re more attractive, funnier, have friends, have a nicer smile, etc.

Buts it also deeper than that- I start to feel unloveable and unworthy, like I actually am the POS my ex told me I was. I’m just not good enough for anyone.

Has anyone else gone through this? What helped you?",2025-03-11 00:50:21,2025-03-17 02:05:32,all_new_posts
1j8ee2h,My boyfriend trapped me in our home.,Old-Cup-6065,7,2025-03-11 00:43:51+00:00,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j8ee2h/my_boyfriend_trapped_me_in_our_home/,"My boyfriend (M/27) and I (F/27) have been together over a year. I will say the good times are really good however once we moved in together I've been discovering new things about him every day that I don't like. 

We moved in together 6 months after dating. I justified it because I needed a roommate to cut costs or I needed to move back to my parents due to a career switch. We also were co workers prior so we have an existing friendship so it wasn't like I didn't know him.

After the big move I just felt something was off so I went through his phone and found out he had been emotionally cheating on me with a girl Ive already specifically told him I did not like. After that, on routine almost every two months something big happens and I want to leave but he ropes me back in. The other big one I will mention was that he has a porn addiction. 

It's now been three months since the porn addiction discovery. I broke up with him on the spot he begged and begged to stay together. He stayed with his parents for about two weeks then he moved back in. Everything has been fine since until last night and I do not know what to do. 

For context I work two jobs. I have a day job in sales and I bartend at night on the weekends. Saturday night is like my night. I have Sunday off so I work my day job go close the bar and then I go out for about an hour with my best friend and other co workers. I don't have a lot of free time so it's my night to let loose... Responsibly. Yes I drink but I respect my limits. I really just want to have good conversation hear live music and play some pool.

My boyfriend has started voicing that he doesn't like this. I've put my foot down because it's one of the only nights I get to see my bestie and it's been our tradition since we were 21. Our schedules are conflicting now so this is one of the few times we actually get to catch up.

He has now started trying to invite himself. If her boyfriends coming along I'll gladly invite him but if not... I don't. He then started coming into the bar an hour prior to close sitting there getting wasted. I've asked my co workers to cut him off. They don't. He then follows us around and almost tries to physically stand between me and whoever I am trying to talk to. 

On this night in particular his brother and sister in law who is pregnant were in the area. I love them to pieces so I of course told them to come to the bar and invited them to hang out with me and my friend. At this point my boyfriend has already walked in and started his drinking. He got a ride from a friend and they left so apparently he was ""stranded"" once everything is cleaned I tell them I'm going to go wash my hands when I come back my boyfriend is almost forcng his ear on his sister in laws belly to the extent his brother stepped and said ""whoa whoa you usually got to ask first"" 

My boyfriend immediately turned to me and said ""I'm sorry if I've made you uncomfortable babe"" he then started informing them of my miscarriages (that were not with him) and my infertility issues. When we were walking out it was just us. He asked again if that bothered me. 

I replied yes... And went into detail as to why. He started yelling at me telling me that I'm not happy for this baby to be In our lives. He would not stop. 

I told him ""let's not talk about heavy topics while we are intoxicated"" let's make a note and revisit it in the morning. He then went on to tell me I don't love him and that I'm selfish. I almost bailed on everyone but instead I stood my ground and figured I have existing plans and he doesn't get to mess it up. 

The night went on and basically when we were around people he was the sweetest most perfect angel when it was just us he was verbally attacking me. My friend picked up on it and asked me to walk to a different bar down the street just her and I. Do a shot (it was industry night) and come back. 

I go up to my boyfriend and I tell him ""we are going to go to ""bar"" do a shot and come back. Are you okay with that?"" He said yes and gave me a big ol kiss. 

She keeps trying to open up the conversation that something is wrong. She told me If I needed a place to stay to tell him we are having a sleepover at her house. As this is going on he is blowing up my phone. He walks into the bar we are at pissed as can be. Not responding to my friend speaking to him ECT. We go to walk with her to her apartment which is downtown and as we are hugging goodbye he high tails it to my car. We get in and he yells at me the whole way home.

Hes saying things like ""fuck you!"" ""You left me and you left my brother! How disrespectful of you!"" ""I'm going to call your parents to tell them about your behavior"" ""you will be the laughing stock of my family"" he then breaks up with me and asks me to take him to his families. When we get there his yelling gets more intense telling me I don't love him. So I go to our house. I was nonverbal this whole time and he was so mad that I wasn't speaking. Begging me and almost forcing me to look him in my eyes. I tried to pull over he got more abrasive.

When we arrived I asked him to please leave me in the car while I cool off. He got more in my face so I got out of my car and thought I could walk around the block maybe give him time to chill out and me time to decompress. Before I know it he is running down the street yelling and cussing at me. Saying ""I'm going to fucking catch you. You think you can run from me! I can run faster"" so I turned around to walk home. My outdoor cat was with me walking (he always walks with me) he then started saying I was being so crazy I scared out cat. 

Still not saying anything I walked inside and locked myself in our bathroom and started hyperventilating. He was outside yelling still. He then stuck something in the key hole to unlock it and started shining a flashlight in my face. He kept trying to put his hands on me as ""comfort"" but I kept asking him to not touch me I basically had myself wedged in the corner I tried to push him away. After that he stands in front of the sink like he is about to puke. I say ""babe let's go to the toilet"" he won't respond and projectile vomits all in our sink. 

After this he starts yelling at me ""your going to leave and not help me when I'm sick!"" ""And your going to push me!"" I was fed up at this point so my response was ""I'm not cleaning that up you are"" I walked away and I go to the upstairs bathroom to take my makeup off and get ready for bed. Before I know he barges in with a towel covered in vomit and throws it in my face. I looked him dead in the eyes and said

""If your going to throw things at me get out of my house""

He goes ""oh it's just a towel"" and starts reminding me of all of my flaws. 

At this point his sister in law texted letting me know they were home and that she had a lot of. I questioned texting her but didn't. 

Our argument got heavier as I was trying to kick him out. I then decided I was leaving. I grabed a bag and headed to the door. I texted my friend a brief synopsis and wondering if I could stay with her and her boyfriend for the night. As I head for the door my boyfriend pushes me. He blocked the door. Everytime I move towards the door I'm getting pushed I'm getting pulled. At one point it was almost open and I thought I could duck under his arm and squeeze through the passage and he slams it shut on my fingers. I imediatly go for the back door. As I get to the kitchen he is there again pulling me and pushing me. I sat down in defeat. He then sat next to me and cried and cried about all this traumatic shit I've never heard about his life. 

As I was sitting I texted his sister in law what happened. I was hoping his brother would come get him. Instead I was told ""yeah he gets like that when he's too drunk. Usually his mom just has to babysit him and wait till he calms down. I think you just need to try to deescalate the situation."" She then went on to tell me ""I don't think ""boyfriend"" is dangerous. Some people just a cross a line when they are fucked up"" 

We went to sleep after and then I told him he needed to leave and I was breaking up with him. Keep in mind I woke up with bruises which really made it sink it. Anyways He refused to get up. Refused to leave. Was so apologetic. He doesn't even remember what happened. Said he won't drink again. Said he won't hurt me again. While I was trying to leave the night prior he did threaten the fact that he is on this lease so I can't make him leave. 

I feel stuck. I feel drained. And I'm scared it's going to happen again but next time it will be worse. I don't want to live my life tip toeing but he's right I can't kick him out. Not without a police report at least. I grew up watching my mother be abused and I always swore to myself I would never be her. But here I am. I am my mother. 

I keep telling myself when our lease it up I will either move or I will resign without him and have him removed. But I also know the more time I spend with him I always automatically make every wrong doing he has done to me... Forgivable. I treasure our good moments. I am at a loss. Im ashamed of myself and I'm so scared of what's next in our relationship but I am also so scared to be without him. I'm scared to say ""we broke up"" I'm scared to tell my family who loves him what happened. I am scared to not have him with me when I need him. I am scared to say goodbye to this life I thought we built.

She sent me pictures and the way i cried for her all night breaks my heart, especially because I was her a few years ago. 

This man has beaten her black and blue, knocked her out, given her black eyes, dragged her on the street in public and who knows what else that she hasn’t told me. She currently lives with him and his entire family (who she says had no idea this was going on as she would wear make up and hide it from them) hours away from me and her sister and the rest of her family lives states away. 

To make matters worse, she was pregnant and it seems like she wanted to keep it but then decided to get an abortion ( I’m guessing something happened between them that made her want to make that decision) but because of the state we were in, she had to fly to another state to get it done. He couldn’t even bother going with her and she had to go thru the process all alone. This also wasn’t the first abortion she’s gotten since being with him. 

She admitted to me while crying she knows he’s going to kill her one day. I always had my suspicions he was abusive but I didn’t know any of this was happening, she hid it so well. I had gotten her a train to come back the following day and she was so ready to get out. She was going to live with her sister and try to get her life together. Because of him, she has lost so many good jobs, lost her car, doesn’t have any money saved up and basically has to start from 0. I was anxious for her to actually get on the train because she has left him and went back to him so many times and i was hoping that since now she was admitting all the horrible things he’s done, maybe she was ready to leave. But then the next morning when she was getting ready to leave, she admitted that he asked her to stay for at least one more day and cancelled the ticket. She tried to play it off that it was because she couldn’t fit all her things on a train and would figure out another way to get all her stuff packed and get here. 

This is where I’m torn. My husband is telling me to tell her sister but her sister is younger and instead of being nurturing, she responds with anger. I know when i was in that situation, i wouldn’t want to talk to someone who was angry with me. I also feel like her sister will tell their parents and I’m not sure what will happen then. I know they can’t force her to leave him but what if they do and then she ruins connections with them? She also said she could never tell her mom because her mom worries enough as it is and i know her sister will tell their mom. But im a mom now too and would want to know if my daughter was going thru this. I also know i will never forgive myself if something happens to her and i never said anything. 

She’s suppose to come to our town for her sisters birthday next weekend and their mom will be here then so im wondering if i should tell her sister beforehand so maybe they can try to talk to her once they’re all together ?? 

She already feels like she has no one and i dont want to make things harder for her but at the same time if it means i might be able to save her life, it’s worth it. ",2025-03-10 18:27:24,2025-03-17 02:05:40,all_new_posts

But for most of my life, I didn’t know we could challenge the ruling of her death. In 1990, my mother, Dawn Caraveo, was found dead under suspicious circumstances. Despite her history of severe domestic violence, multiple hospitalizations, and forensic red flags, her death was ruled a suicide—with no real investigation.

In 2003, my sister tried to get the case reopened, but she was ignored. Last year, I started pushing again, and Indiana State Police have finally reopened the case. But no family should have to fight this long just to be heard.

I’m now advocating for legislative reforms to prevent other families from going through this. If you believe in holding law enforcement accountable for misclassified deaths and ensuring real investigations into suspicious suicides, I’d love your support.

1j82but,Potential Abuse from Autistic Partner,PaintingWooden7399,4,2025-03-10 16:13:09+00:00,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j82but/potential_abuse_from_autistic_partner/,"I am writing this partly to vent and partly for advice because I'm really not sure what to do in this situation.

My partner (M 29) and I (F 27) have been together for over 6 years and have lived together for the past 5 years. My partner is diagnosed with Asperger's/Autism, which I didn't really know much about before being in the relationship with him. Recently I have been unsure if some of his behaviour during his Autistic meltdowns can be considered abuse or if they're just symptoms of his disability.

Some of these issues include-

\- he regularly puts his mental health issues above mine i.e. if I ask him to rephrase something to help me better understand it, he can't do that because that's forcing him to mask and he shouldn't have to mask in his home

\- if he can't finish a task that he's set for himself, he gets more and more agitated as time goes on where he hits road blocks and can't sort the task. The agitation often escalates to him throwing objects across the room, breaking things that are causing him distress, shouting, etc. I feel like I have to step in to help keep him calm or else I might get in the cross hairs of this anger and violence

\- when he has an autistic meltdown he's often unaware of his surroundings and convulses, but wants me to be physically close to him in these moments. Often in the midst of this he can climb on top of me, physically restraining me or over powering me, occasionally hitting me, kicking me or biting me. He also often blames me for causing the meltdowns because I accidentally interrupted him during a task, didn't do something he asked me to do 'because his brain needed it', asked him the wrong question, etc.

\- he often tells me he wants to express his love to me by pulling my hair or biting me but he tries to repress it. When he does randomly yank my hair, and I get upset at him for it he won't accept responsibility for doing it 

He says that he does all of these things because of his autism and that's just how autistic people/brains express themselves, but I am very uncomfortable in this situation. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells to keep his mood calm in our flat and if I try to create any distance between us (going in the other room, leaving the flat, staying at a friends) because I feel uncomfortable, he kicks off more, threatens to break things, hurt me, or physically stops me from leaving. 

Does this count as abuse or not because of his diagnosis?

P.S. it's not an easy answer of just leave because I'm unhappy, I'm in the country on a relationship visa so leaving the relationship would jeopardise my immigration status and my job that I really love. ",2025-03-10 16:13:09,2025-03-17 02:05:47,all_new_posts

I (f25) and my boyfriend (m26) were having an argument while drunk. I went to bed while he still drank more in the kitchen. He came in and grabbed my phone and told me I was cheating. I let him take it to check it. When he couldn’t find anything he threw my phone at me. I grabbed it and immediately called an uber to my mom’s. He grabbed my phone again and asked me where I was going, I told him not to worry about it because I want to leave. He grabbed my phone and threw it on the floor and started stumping on it, breaking it. I got up from bed and when I reached down to grab it he reached down too and I pushed him away from it. He pushed me and took my phone, at this point I was afraid and I rant to the neighbors and asked them to call the police because he had taken my phone and was breaking it. The police came and they wanted to take pictures of me, I told them i didn’t want that, I just wanted my phone back to go to my moms. The cop said okay and then told me to put my hands behind my back. I was extremely confused because I hadn’t hurt him. 

I spent the weekend in jail and was ordered to not contact him which is fine because I no longer wanted to and I definitely do not want to go back to jail. 

He’s been trying to reach me, I got out last night and he’s showed up and trying to call and text, I’ve blocked him and I haven’t answered the door. I’m staying with my mom since me and him live together. I’m now afraid. I feel like a criminal, I’m afraid the cops are coming back for me, I’m afraid of him too because I can’t be within 500 feet and this is the third time he’s coming by in one night and I just got out last night. I don’t want to involve the cops or call them anymore or ever again because I’m afraid they will take me. I don’t know what to do. He’s texting me from different numbers and accounts apologizing. He’s calling my family and my friends. It’s been one night since I’ve been out and he’s saying he won’t give up. It is sending me in a bunch of emotions. Im at the point where I want to end it all or just want to run away forever. I don’t know if anyone has been in a similar situation and what if you where what did you do about it. I don’t ever want to involve the cops again because last time I did I ended up in jail and now I’m afraid. ",2025-03-10 14:05:08,2025-03-17 02:05:51,all_new_posts

I took it two years into my marriage after several instances of domestic violence had already occurred. Ironically this wedding cake topper did not break by intention or as a result of violence. It just fell / got knocked over by me on accident. I am now 4 years into my failing marriage but even back then deep down something inside me saw it as foreshadowing or maybe even the reality of my marriage but I was not ready to accept it. It just looked like poetry when I placed the pieces in my ring dish so I just took the photo… and stayed for another two years.

I read that one way to work through cognitive dissonance is to write down everything that person has done to hurt you. It makes it real. It makes it undeniable. I wish it made it easier… this so is hard. Please pray for me to find the strength to let go. To call the lawyer…again. To go through with it…

It's been over 2 years since I last saw my ex that would have killed me, and I was finally starting to feel like I would give dating another chance. I matched with the hottest guy on Hinge, we texted all the time until we went out (art museum evening date) and he was really sweet and we talked for 7 hours straight that night. We hooked up and it was definitely a little rough but super normal as far as what guys my age and type are into (and I'm fine with it).

We didn't see eachother for a few weeks but talked on the phone, he never made the conversation sexual at all but he came over last week and it felt like he was a completely different person. I was still recovering from a concussion (from my neighbor holding my head underwater, long story) and I told him that, and he still pressured me into giving him head. I didn't explicitly say no so I don't hold that against him, but after he was done I kept telling things about how my life had been going with school, internship searching, friends etc. and he would interrupt what I was saying to do really degrading things. 

Important to note this is a second date, he pulled a roll of duct tape sized electrical tape out of his bag and was like 'how do you want to be tied up' and I said uhhh...maybe another time, 15 min later he tried putting these white tablets in my mouth and I freaked out even when he said they were mints and he had one. I was talking about switching my major (we're both lying on my bed) and he just looks at me in the eye and spits on my face.

A couple days went by, I was really upset because prior to anything physical he had said he's looking for something long term and he could see us being really good together, and so for him to act like he did after saying that shattered my heart. He texted asking how I was, and I said I wasn't great and that I didn't think we would be happy together because we have very different perspectives on intimacy. He responded with the sweetest message back. 

I feel like I made the wrong decision, like because I already have PTSD maybe I was overreacting or something. I guess I'm just looking for advice because if it was really 'just a sex thing' I think I could communicate boundaries with him. I also know that I might be addicted to the way he made me see myself, or that all I've ever known is intimate partner violence that was objectively much worse. I am so sad because this would have been the first guy that wasn't just using me as a punching bag and a sex doll. I miss him so much I can't stop thinking about it and I have no idea why.",2025-03-10 02:17:55,2025-03-17 02:06:00,all_new_posts

The first five we were extreme alcoholics where he would choke me almost every night, he's given me black eyes which I've gone to emergency room and lie and his begging behalf, dragged me around by my hair, punched my in the side of the head, etc. The only proof I had was a message between us after we got sober where he was admitting that he strangled me and ""is that all our relationship was going to be about"" as well as pictures from the black eye and me in a scrub and hospital room. I never said anything, or did anything because we were in a relationship together. It was finally after I got tired of all that on top of talking to girls behind my back, extreme verbal abuse, neglect, laziness. I found out from my oldest son who was his ""stepson"" that he was abusing him as well. Not as extreme but he shouldn't have ever put his hands on my son. I took him to court, showed what limited evidence I had. My kids were also interviewed by their lawyer but because they're minors there testimony is considered ""hear say"". I got granted five years of a more or less stay away order. We can text but only about our shared son (my youngest). I also have primary placement, all medical decisions, he pays child support. 

Why does it feel like it doesn't matter, and there's no justice for those who were brainwashed and abused. I'm in trauma therapy finally after waiting three years after leaving him. I want to get the ""stay away"" order extended but I don't think I will be able to.

After five years if he has good behavior can he take me back to court and get everything I was granted (aside from the stay away order). He has rather limited visitation too. ",2025-03-09 23:52:37,2025-03-17 02:06:02,all_new_posts

WEEK. that spans my entire right side from my armpit to my thigh from where he was kicking me while i was literally sleeping on the floor. i cant even move very well and ive considered going to the hospital because i keep having dark brown almost black blood as if i have my period but i dont. he called off work because i hit him. if i called off work every time he hit me, every time i bruised, was exhausted, hurting, aching, i wouldnt have a job because i dont remember a time in the last 6 years where i wasnt feeling absolutely horrible. before one bruise heals the next is already there.

basically i just feel like these people are such whiny babies, truly. the world revolves around them. they cant take what they dish. he cried last night to me and told me hes so sorry and he deserves it and all this shit. i didnt even entertain it, i was still riding the high from being able to jump on his back. hes very very tall and just generally big and i’m 5’3” so i felt like an action hero. he started crying louder and yelling at me and said something like “im literally crying and begging for you to comfort me and youre walking away.” he was crying super loud so i said “if i cried like that when you abuse me every single fucking day youd be in there yelling at me calling me a pussy and telling me to shut up. at least i keep my crying to myself. you sound like a baby” which just made him angry and the whole cycle started over again. the funniest part was seeing how his narcissistic ass acts when he gets what he dishes, even the tiniest little bit over all these years the first time i ever retaliated and this is how he acts?? nothing makes you feel more strong than seeing how someone else would handle your situation, especially the person who put you there. i live 400 miles from my mom now so i have nothing, i had to quit my job, i know nobody here. i havent talked to anyone i know since december last year, and i was thinking about reaching out my friend and he reacted like a baby, as expected. i guess being so completely isolated from everyone and everything made me go feral, but i’m still riding it. hopefully i can make him rethink the way he treats me and shift the power dynamic a little. the funniest thing by far was when he said i couldve killed him. from punching you in the face??? you literally stepped on my neck like.. two days ago. i felt something crack in the back of my head, and now ive had a headache ever since. god knows what he knocked out of place. you were so close to killing me and didnt care, and this is just the most recent time. i literally felt like laughing. i said something along the lines of.. “you think that couldve killed you? you come within inches of killing me multiple times a month and have no idea. some day you really could kill me and you’d be surprised because youre you stupid to know what youre doing.” obviously that didnt make him very happy. 

i wonder how long i can ride this high. theres been two fights since, and i didnt fight back, but i still feel so good from the night i did. i feel invincible.

1j7j70w,Dad being abused by stepmom,Ok-Appointment8904,3,2025-03-09 22:12:34+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j7j70w/dad_being_abused_by_stepmom/,"It’s just been me (16F)and my dad (44M) since I was a little girl, my dad was mentally ill and my father had full custody of me. My biological parents get along well, but just were not a good match. My father has dated a few people throughout my life, most ending fairly quickly. He began dating a woman about 4 years ago let’s just call her Miley (44F). Me and Miley did not get along from the start. This was not just usual stepmom stepdaughter rivalry, she made a point for me to know she hated me. It started with making fun of my clothing, and my dad’s. Honestly, I can’t recount every awful thing she’s said to me because I’ve blocked most of it out. But it just got so much worse. My father moved me and him 100 miles away from home so we could be closer to his new girlfriend. Now all we had was her, and her family. This family owns a mega church in the city, and three companies, they’re everywhere. The family has so many deep rooted issues. My father decided it would be best for us to move in with Miley so we could all have a “happy family” I refused this idea and my father was upset with me because he thought I was just being petty, I knew it was a bad decision. So we moved in with Miley. Things got so bad. She set up cameras in our living room, hallway to my bedroom, and in her son’s (11M) game room. She commonly watched me for no reason on these and would make comments just to frazzle me on these cameras (through the microphone). She made sure to let me know her sons did not want me living with them and did not like me. She also told me how her son’s biological father did not like me, because he did not like how I moved in with them (like it’s my choice?) One day I got home and found my bed covered in pee, and then all my stuff animals, my laundry baskets, and even worse ALL MY LINGERIE. I instantly knew it was her son, her son commonly shits in closets in the house and blames it on the dogs, and like that he blames this on the dogs. 
I was going crazy and told my dad and he was enraged, when he spoke to Miley about it she said she can’t do anything and it’s not her fault because it’s her son who did it not her, her son refuses to admit he did it, and she does not let me or my father speak to him about it. After, Miley crashed her car into mine well pulling out of the driveway, who knows if this was on purpose, when it happened I called my father to express how upset I was and on the cameras she listened to the entire conversation then ridiculed me and my father for talking about her. (My dad had to pay for the entire repair of the car, Miley did not give a dime)
Miley blamed my father for this, that he was too dramatic. Now going forward things got so much worse. 
Miley makes fun of everything my father does, refuses to eat his meals, refuses to be close to him, and refuses to tell him anything that’s going on.
Miley sets up situations to embarrass my father, and to stress him out. She will commonly try shit talking MY OWN FATHER with me which I do not. Even Miley’s  own family has admitted to me that they know she is awful to my father. She screams at my dad if he tries disciplining to her kids at all, even though she screams at me constantly for everything I do. 
My father’s family is scared for him and wants him to leave her, but he is financially stuck since he helped pay for her house to be renovated and now has no money left. 

I know some may say that this does not sound abusive, but please remember I am the child and do not see much they hide a lot of it from me. My dad is numb, and a shell of who he used to be. I am scared for him and what I am wondering is if I should graduate so we can move away because I think he is only staying so I can go to school in the city Miley lives in. 

I love my dad and I want him to be happy again, I am scared. ",2025-03-09 22:12:34,2025-03-17 02:06:06,all_new_posts

He'll also laugh way too much at when watching sitcoms at night, as if I'm not around, even though my room is next door to he. He also admits it's fun fooling around with me because he knows I don't really like it and  knows I think it's kind of stupid of him to act like a child.

He'll actually throw a fit if the cat legitimately does something wrong, or if he has to unexpectedly to waste his time on even a minor setback on a long or busy day, even if the request has a legitimate point. Not to mention he seems barely capable of internalizing his anger. He'll also shove me out of his room and tell me not to bother him or hang out unless I actually need something or playing around with the kitty in his room.

I did call the police and they initially told me on the phone the PFA was against me specifically and didn't have an address on it. I told them it did and I was granted residency.
 The officer did call me back and apologize. He ""didn't have all the information"" when he talked to me the first time. They also let him drive away in his car with a suspended license. They did write up the violation and texted me the case number. 
Now my question is what do I do about him messaging me everyday. He has also called a few times. Nothing abusive but he goes back and forth between being mad at me and then trying to get me to talk to him or meet up with him. I have not replied or answered at all. 
Court for the PFA hearing is next week. Do I call 911 for every message/call as a violation? Or just keep collecting evidence and show it to the judge?

I told him I could not forgive him for what he did to me. My issue is that i want to move to South Carolina and he wants to move to Texas. He has a felony against him until he finishes a program. I am wondering if i will get sole custody and be able to move to SC. Anyone have a similar experience? We both have no family support where we are now. So it only makes sense for us to move.

My husband was acting weirdly angsty, I asked him what’s going on, and he attacked me. 

I instantly switched and went to whatever force was needed to get him to stop. I picked up a wood plank and just kept going until he stopped.

I basically beat the crap out of my husband the moment he started to attack me. It’s like I switched and was out for blood, I didn’t even care if he would have hurt me more than I did him.

He had the GALL to complain to me about his arm hurting after I went ham. Like… I’m sorry. What? You want to fight someone and not get hurt? 

Ahh! But you wanted to fight someone you thought was weaker than you and THAT’s why you’re upset you got hurt!!!

Fucking idiot. 

I feel weird about NOT feeling guilty. It’s like I suddenly realized how freaking pathetic he really is, the moment he started complaining to me about what got hurt. 

Excuse me??? You want me to feel sorry for you… After you literally FREAKING attacked me???

Like ummm? If I had been a dude and you got hurt in a fight with me you wouldn’t be complaining 🙂 

I started making fun of him a shit ton later on. Like “uuuuww I tried to beat my woman and she hurt me back uwwww” like you are pathetic. PATHETIC!!!

Definitely in my villain era lol.

Call your mom if you want sympathy!!! Oh 😂 oh wait, that’s right, you’ll have to fucking LIE about what happened because anyone who knows the truth of what happened won’t feel sorry for you lmao 🥴😂 Goooo fuck yourself 

Just hope that people here can wake up and realize what sorry sons of bitches these abusers are! They’re fucking empty shells of humans . 

Picking fights over the stupidest things. Not using their words but get shocked when they get treated like a misbehaving animal! 

I would do it again and again, because these fools don’t deserve to win with their shitty methods of control and fear. Don’t start what you’re not prepared to finish.",2025-03-09 16:46:47,2025-03-17 02:06:13,all_new_posts

My mom lives in Lynnhaven, FL and has been in an emotionally abusive marriage for about 20 years now. She has reached retirement age, and he's becoming even more isolating, as he knows that she wants to spend more time with her elderly parents and grandchildren. This weekend, she missed my niece's birthday which would've been the first time we've seen her since Thanksgiving, and she's been telling us for months that was when we would see her again. She is unable to tell me why she didn't come and is turning her phone off instead of telling me why. She says she wants to leave him, but I am really struggling to see that at this point; she's evasive and honestly acts like she's afraid. He won't let her go to counseling, he won't let her drive herself, and won't let me drive to pick her up. She is terrified when I tell her that I'm gonna tell someone about all this and threatens to not talk to me anymore if I do. I am DESPERATE for some resources, locally or of any kind at all. Someone that could call her? A crisis interventionist type situation? anything is worth a shot at this point. Thanks in advance. ",2025-03-09 15:45:06,2025-03-17 02:06:15,all_new_posts

I always knew the signs, the cycle, what it looks like. I guess I thought I would be better prepared to know what to do if it came down to it. My friend is poor, can’t find a job, lives with her physically disabled dad and is only 19. She met a boy that she’s been seeing for around 6 months maybe more or less, he helps out with her financially since her father is unable to provide things like groceries etc (as well as letting her use his car since she can’t afford one). She’s a long distance friend i’ve known for over 5 years at this point, she lives in the States and she became pregnant with him (by accident of course) For the past few months he’s been abusing her in more ways than one, he’s cut off my contact with her because he went through our messages where she told me some things he’s done and I told her to leave him. She’s facetimed me showing me bruises only to rush off the phone because he came back, he helps himself to come over without an invite or heads up and told her she has to leave the window unlocked so he can enter at any time. He is ALWAYS over and it seems impossible to reach out with her because she’s asked me to not text her anything involving him and I can’t ask if he’s over either. So I never know if it’s safe to reach out or not. He’s texted me off her phone as well as other people pretending to be her and lecturing her friends for disrespecting him (while he’s texting as her) He’s controlling, dangerous (owns a firearm), manipulative, physically abusive, will punish her with dangerous things such as driving them out somewhere while she’s drunk and forcing her to drive back home intoxicated. She can’t afford an abortion on her own and last I heard she was staying with him so he could pay for one (it’s around $500 where she lives) But I recently called her briefly when he stepped out of the room but she said she couldn’t talk about it but she normally would so I think he was still with her and told her to say he wasn’t (i’m not supposed to know she’s pregnant). Apart of this was me needing to rant out of frustration for not being able to help, but also advice. I’m heartbroken that after all i’ve been through I have absolutely no clue what to do or how to help. I feel like I forgot everything I once knew about these situations. I considered giving her an ultimatum to leave him or or I stop being her friend soley with the hope and intention it wakes her up because she can live without his money (not easily) and it’s been so frustrating watching this all snowball and progressively get worse and worse, she once told me I barely know half of the bad things he’s done and I can barely imagine.

I’m tired of the cycle of abuse I’m in and want it to end but I don’t know where to start or what to do. I (24, F) have been with my partner (27, M) for over two years. This is my first “adult” relationship outside of my high school ones so I let a lot of things slide because I was in love with this person. One of them being the physical and emotional abuse from them. For a year and a half, I have denied to myself that I was even in an abuse relationship. Lying to friends and family about certain bruises on me. I thought it would stop, he would change, and that it wasn’t as bad as I thought it was. That I was soft. 

It started to get worse since he moved in with me a year ago. I want it to be over, I feel like I can’t take it anymore. I’m going back and forward with even making this post. I want to speak up, tell someone, do something to make this stop. But there’s this part of me that feels guilty, and I know it’s only because I have love for this person. I’m asking myself is all this pain really worth the “love” I’m getting? 

Kicking him out isn’t enough, because he talks his way back and I don’t have the strength to stick to my word. I have kicked him out, tried cutting him off, but I bend back to his will each time. The only reason I never went to the authorities is because I never wanted to do that to him. I couldn’t go through with putting him through that situation. It sounds silly as I write it but I just couldn’t get myself to speak up. I barely started speaking about it in therapy, but refer it as past abuse and not current. Again afraid of authorities getting involved. 

Today he went too far. And now I’m thinking that getting authorities involved is the only way to make it stop. But I have no idea where to start, what do I say? I have been keeping photo evidence of my bruises and certain videos of his behaviors. It was mainly to show him proof that he is hurting me. He would be drunk most times and forget he had hands on me. 

Would I have to face him or court or is this something that could be resolved without me facing him? Do I need some kind of lawyer? I just have no idea about all these next steps. I always avoided the topics and resources because I felt like I wasn’t going through what I thought I was. 

So I mainly just want an idea of what I should do, what I should expect and what the outcomes would be. I’m from Southern California. I do know my local police station and number. I have records of photos, videos and therapy sessions. This is all I have so far. I know I could look up this information but I want advice from those who had been through this, and the support to get out of this abusive relationship. Anything will help, thank you.

After three years of suffering, I finally found the courage to leave my partner. I moved everything out while he was at work and got out of our apartment. The guilt and heartbreak have been overwhelming since then, and I’ve been struggling with a constant sick feeling in my heart.

Yesterday, I took a pregnancy test, feeling torn and unsure. I told myself that if it was positive, it would be a sign to go back to him. To my shock, the test came back positive. I’m devastated.

I know my choice is to go through with an abortion, but now I’m grappling with the decision of contacting him and the emotional turmoil of wondering if I’ve made the wrong choice. For the past few days, I’ve convinced myself that maybe he really was my soulmate, despite everything we went through. I’m unsure if I’m just spiraling or if there’s some truth to this feeling.

I’m really lost right now and could use any advice, especially from anyone who’s been in a similar situation",2025-03-09 06:19:24,2025-03-17 02:06:20,all_new_posts

Every time I try to get space or set boundaries, he escalates his tactics in ways that fly under the radar legally. He has multiple devices (iPhone, Android, laptop, tablet) and extensive knowledge of hacking, coding, and social engineering, which he's used to intimidate me. He had a suspended license for over a year and just got it back a few days ago and with his new freedom he's been more bold and confident. I have no friends and he's sabotaged every job l've ever gotten.
At the moment I keep getting password reset codes for my iCloud and emails about login attempts I didn't make. Even when I block him, he harasses me from endless new numbers and even disguises his calls to look like my sister or cousin. He even has hacked other people's facebook accounts to try to befriend me. I don't know how to prove this or what steps to take. My fight-or-flight is constantly activated, and I feel lost.
Any advice on safety precautions or legal options would be deeply appreciated.
Steps I have taken include checking all my socials and any other accounts to make sure my passwords and recovery measures are up to date. Along with making what social media I do have as private as possible. The only family I have (my sis and cousin) are aware and I've warned them to be aware of accounts and other activities from people they don't know, as they have had to block his number and other accounts as well.",2025-03-09 02:38:11,2025-03-17 02:06:21,all_new_posts

We are married for year and in relationship for 5 years. 
I was blamed for everything for the last two years and I didn’t even realise that till now.
I didn’t work - I’m annoying. I found a job - I was humiliated that I have such insignificant income and was laughed at. I was pushed into taking birth control because he didn’t want to wear condom, and later was told that “I was just worried about your health”. I got pregnant and WE decided to do an abortion - after I was told that I failed as a woman and I’m disgusting. After that I feel completely ruined. 
He told me he will deport me if I won’t shut up. Sometimes throwing me on the floor, grabbing my neck. Sometimes he drives drunk and now gets upset when I refuse to go with him. Now he says he doesn’t care, he lied me about our relationship and my immigration, claiming that he just felt pity for me that left me heartbroken. 
There is nothing left from me. I don’t feel myself as a human being. He told me to leave if I want. Is he lying again and will threat me after that I don’t know.
I want to die to be honest. I’m completely alone without anybody anywhere. 
I wish he could kill me or something will happen and my existence will end. 


Edit: I wanna thank you all for supporting and helpful advice :3

1j6sxo8,Is this emotional abuse?,SweetSea3399,9,2025-03-08 22:36:08+00:00,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j6sxo8/is_this_emotional_abuse/,"I was married for several years, recently divorced. I don’t think my ex is a bad person. However, the church we were in saw men as the “final say” in everything, and women were asked to be “submissive.” My ex and I were more liberal than most on this, but it was still ultimately the belief. 

Before we got married, I became more worried about my looks. He liked my makeup to be done certain ways. On the first night of our honeymoon, he laughed at me when I came out in lingerie. He said it just didn’t fit right and he thought I was trying to be silly. It was a pretty bold choice, but this being my first time, I felt like that was not very kind. He couldn’t believe how much I held onto that experience. Often, when I was downstairs and ready to go somewhere, he would look at me with disapproval because he didn’t feel like my outfit was flattering or coordinated. I would often change. Mostly, I chose my outfits to try to please him. He would often come shopping with me and help me decide what to buy. He said he liked my style, but he always seemed like he was trying to hone it to be more like his style. 

When I would get hurt, he would suddenly get really mad and yell, though it would usually dissipate quickly. This especially happened if he had told me not to do something and then I did it (even accidentally) and ended up getting hurt. He said he just didn’t want to see me hurt. At first, he wouldn’t let me go to coffee, lunch, etc. with male coworkers because he “worried about what they might do.” Over time, he loosened up on that, but he did always want to know where I was. I turned on location sharing for a bit, but I got tired of being asked about me going to get coffee or ice cream. 

He got upset with me when I would poke fun at him around other people or say anything negative about him. He said it was disrespectful. So I stopped sharing anything negative about him. We were around my family a lot, but he didn’t like me asking them for advice on things, because he felt he should be the leader and not them. He felt they didn’t need to be involved in our decisions in that way. When I would go somewhere with someone one on one and would tell him about the conversation we had, he would ask for the exact wording I used for certain things and then get frustrated if I didn’t remember or get upset with me for saying things in a way that didn’t reflect well on him or us. Eventually, I got to the point where I felt like he was the only person who understood me, but somehow now I wonder if that might have had to do with me having to filter conversations with everyone else to match his preferences.

He would tell me that if we didn’t have sex often enough it would cause him to “stumble” and look at other women sexually. He would get frustrated/grumpy if we didn’t have sex every 2-3 days. On my period, I was ideally expected to please him in some way, even if I didn’t want to have sex. He only actually kept going when I said “no” one time, I think. I confronted him about it, and he did feel bad about it and didn’t do it again. However, he then was kind of insistent that he “wanted me to want it” but would still get frustrated if it wasn’t happening every few days. He would also still want to at least have one hand touching me while we slept, even if I told him I didn’t feel like being touched right then. He would often touch me when we were just living our lives, and it would make me jump or cringe at times.

Some friends tell me that some of the things he did sound like emotional abuse, but others would say that he was a great guy and these things are fairly normal levels of control. He did help a lot around the house, he supported me through grad school, and he was kind. But somehow these things seemed to chip away at my sense of self.

I KNOW it was justified but I feel terrible because he was in complete denial and continually said there were no issues in the relationship and I was the only one who had problems with things. So he was in complete shock when I left even though I spoke with him about things needing to change many times. The DVPO was, I’m sure, an even bigger shock as he does not think there is anything wrong with the way he acts/is in denial/was too drunk to remember what he did. I feel like a monster.

I'm supposed to call on Monday to talk to a family coach. I would have called them yesterday, but I couldn't find the privacy and if he knew it would most likely turn into a horrible argument if he found out.

He turns into such a monster if he isn't getting from me what he wants. Other times it just builds slowly like over a span of days or weeks. Like he'll get impatient over something he thinks I'm doing too slowly and will use a tone that sounds kind of rude. Then maybe that day or days later he'll make a snide comment, but then switch quickly to humor so I'm unsure if I understand what he said and meant by it correctly. Usually his next display is saying something mean about an activity I'm doing or planning. Like if I say I'm going to get the mail, he say something about how I have mail all over the place and it makes the house look like crap. 

If I bring to his attention how he's acting rudely I never know which way it will go. He might say sorry, might blow it off, but usually he'll switch to a sensitive topic like he'll say ""let's go to the bedroom."" Why would I want to be intimate when he's being rude? On top of that I still have all the other stuff in my head that never gets resolved. 

So then I decline his offer and the fight is on. He'll start accusing me of going somewhere and meeting with someone and then point out times in the past that were normal regular situations and accuse them of being something different where I was with someone else or planning it. If I stand up to his manipulations he gets really mad and that's when the abuse goes up a few notches.

I'm so tired of it.",2025-03-08 17:47:14,2025-03-17 02:06:28,all_new_posts

1j6fl1n,I know my relationship is abusive & I can’t leave,Illustrious_Elk_7292,21,2025-03-08 11:53:25+00:00,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j6fl1n/i_know_my_relationship_is_abusive_i_cant_leave/,"
(Warning long post sorry)

I am 22, my boyfriend is 28, I am 34 weeks pregnant with his child and we have been together for only a year. I’ve never had feelings so strongly for someone so quick, to me he was the biggest sweetheart I’ve ever met but I could tell from the get go there were a few red flags.

Our relationship sort of consisted of going out, drinking and doing drugs before I got pregnant, he’s also got another child he can’t see for unknown reasons. He tried pressuring me to get an abortion but I felt so much love for the baby and it just changed something in me instantly so I didn’t go ahead, it didn’t matter to me whether he was there or not because I knew I could handle it on my own.

In the last few months, our relationship has completely deteriorated. Whenever he drinks, he all of a sudden hates me and wants to hurt me.

The first time it happened (probs around 16 weeks into my pregnancy), we were at a pub with my parents, we went home as normal and then something switched in him. He started saying really hurtful things sending me into a panic attack and getting aggressive for not letting him drive drunk, he ended up driving very erratically and I was scared for my life and vomited on myself which he called me disgusting for, and grabbed my arm so hard and twisted it, then threatened to break my arm because I wanted to jump out of the car. When we got home he threatened to break my laptop and pushed me over. 

I have had 4 other situations similar to this, which he denies ever happened.

The fact that he doesn’t admit it, has made me insane to the point I can’t leave him alone because I just want some kind of closure. I feel absolutely crazy and selfish for risking the babies health because I can’t manage my emotions and leave the relationship. I love her so much and I get so angry with myself when I let him do this again, I don’t know why I trust that he won’t. I hate myself.

I love him when he’s sober, I can’t bare the fact he is like this now and I hate him so much but I still hold on to that version of him that once made me so happy but I know he’s gone.

I don’t know what to do anymore. How do you move on without getting the closure you want so bad and accepting that person you once loved is gone? My family physically abused me and did this to me growing up also which is really triggering 😕",2025-03-08 11:53:25,2025-03-17 02:06:30,all_new_posts
1j6bscf,Boyfriend came home drunk and extremely agitated,Impressive_Clock_649,17,2025-03-08 07:13:56+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j6bscf/boyfriend_came_home_drunk_and_extremely_agitated/,"My boyfriend came home after being out with his friend for 6+ hours drinking. (Drove home, somehow) He got upset at me for “coming in hot” when I came downstairs after he got home to get some ibuprofen for a headache and asked why the kitchen door was closed off. 

He escalated things super quickly, clearly wanting to argue. Within 5 minutes he was calling me a see you next Tuesday and saying he doesn’t want to be with me. He will jump to this during arguments and I have told him this upsets me because it seems he can just throw our nearly six year relationship away by being that cavalier about it. 

Almost out of nowhere he starts yelling and cursing at me. Shouting he doesn’t want to be near me. The volume of his shouting is almost making the house shake. Then takes a large shelving unit and tosses it around our back room. Breaks multiple items, and then starts to shove it towards me where I’m standing backed in a corner asking him to stop. Our back room is destroyed from this outburst. 

I am physically fine and in a safe part of the house for the night. He has texted me “I’m so so sorry. I want to be with you and shouldn’t have said that.” 
The physical escalation of this fight brought it to another level for me. I feel heartbroken. This is out of character to get this aggressive, but I’m wondering what to do from here (after tonight). ",2025-03-08 07:13:56,2025-03-17 02:06:31,all_new_posts

The abuser had done things like poured hot food on the stove over my head, slapped me across the face open palmed, dragged me by the hair out to the car and the whole car ride had my hair wadded in their hand and was shaking my head violently, my head hitting the window of the passenger side at points, had me in the push up/plank position for hours and if I cried or fell down from the position he would smack me and make the time I had to do it start all over again. Among other things. 
I’ve been berated, called every name in the book, belittled and talked down to. Idk. 
My head is spinning and that broke my heart to feel so invalidated and also to be not believed or to be made as if I was exaggerating by someone who should’ve protected me. 
That person tells me to let it go already. Part of me is also questioning if what that person said is true.. idk what to think. Is this true? :(",2025-03-08 07:09:10,2025-03-17 02:06:33,all_new_posts

I left my abuser about a year and a half ago. I’ve been feeling stronger, more like myself and overall, I think I get better everyday. I recently started dating again and at first I felt great. But as months go by I began feeling bad. My new partner is nice, considerate, empathetic, understanding… she knows what happened with my ex and has supported me in every way. 

But sometimes, like when she doesn’t share certain things with me in the moment, or does normal things like hang out with friends or want to visit her family without me... I get upset. I know that doing those things is normal, and even though she shows me in many ways that she loves me, I, once again, feel like I’m not enough. My ex hid everything from me, he even hid me from his family for a looong time, he didn’t consider me or my feelings in his plans (even if they’d affect me too). Well, add the violence to that, I just felt that I didn’t know him at all, and in a very sick and sad way, many times I felt that maybe he just didn’t love me because Im not worth loving (I think differently now but my feelings apparently haven’t catch up to reason yet). I don’t know how to explain this to my partner. I don’t know if it’s fair for me to ask her to share more, at the end it’s not on her to solve my anxiety I guess. Does anyone have any advice? Will I ever be able to trust in people again? ",2025-03-08 05:20:36,2025-03-17 02:06:36,all_new_posts

I’m running into some contradictory info online and hoping someone can clarify the legal ramifications of this. If my partner and I are arguing, and it is getting very heated and we’re both clearly very angry, I do think it’s very helpful for both of us if we take 5 minutes to cool down before we try to talk things out. This is usually at the point where I am crying, we are both yelling and I know can easily escalate to physicality (because it has happened before). I try to leave the room but he uses all of his strength to overpower me, he holds me back, pushes me down to the floor and will NOT let me leave the room, saying things like “we need to talk NOW, you can’t run away from this, you’re being unreasonable etc”… Then, sometimes, I go a bit feral and pull out my hair. Last time he wouldn’t let me out of the bedroom, I smashed my head into the wall and made a huge hole. He basically says I am crazy and overreacting for doing these things, and that these are not normal reactions. He’s starting to make me think I have serious mental problems but part of me thinks it is a normal reaction to this treatment... Is it?",2025-03-08 04:03:49,2025-03-17 02:06:37,all_new_posts

Today, he reached out to me and ruined my day right before an important meeting. I tried to place an emergency order, but unfortunately, it was denied.

Recently, we had a conversation and made arrangements to collect our belongings from each other today. I hadn't spoken to him for about 20 hours when he called me, cursing, saying I'm not his responsibility, and then flipped the switch, as narcissists do, and refused to give me my things. So, I called 911 to report the items as stolen. The police advised me to get a protective order, so I went to court, filled out all the paperwork, but the judge denied it. She asked me two vague questions and based her decision on that. I feel discouraged because I thought this was my chance to be heard and to finally get justice. I’m feeling overwhelmed, and honestly, I feel too young to be dealing with all of this.

Should I appeal this decision on Monday? His friends have been reaching out to me, and he has a large Doberman and a gun.

I've been going through therapy, got married to a great guy, I've been working on sobriety. I'm very thankful that I made it out of that relationship as safely as I could. So within that timespan he's been in 2 other marriages, both of them failed ( naturally ). I never publicly outed my ex fiancée for abuse with the exception of talking to ex wife #1 when I was actively in that relationship, while being friends with her and I privately confided in her that he assaulted me, they ended messing around behind my back regardless after that conversation . Me and ex fiancée broke up over it amongst other reasons, they got married and divorced shortly after.

I don't feel comfortable reaching out to her because I don't want to stir anything and find myself on my exes radar, but I feel guilty and horrible that I never said anything publicly, never pressed charges, and it resulted in another woman being harmed. I know it's not my fault and it's out of my control, but the guilt is starting to weigh on me.  He's really the worst and this is not how I want to be reminded that I was truly gaslit about my own abuse. And I feel horrible that his second ex wife went through the exact thing I went through.

My partner of 10 years has had fits of violent anger occasionally throughout our time together. Things have escalated in the past several weeks. He grew up in an abusive and excessively strict home and has worked in similar environments (restaurant industry) and has never really unpacked the impact of that so I understand why he needs things a certain way or feels disregulated. I try very hard but can be clumsy and forgetful, I'm an anxious person and always thinking about a million things which keeps me from being as present in my body or on the task right in front of me. I understand that it's frustrating to him and might feel like I don't care or I'm not trying. But when I don't clean a dish completely perfectly or accidentally break something or put something away not folded exactly as he had it, he really lashes out (""you dumbass motherfucker can't do anything right and irk my whole soul!""). Right now this is happening at least once a day and then he'll tell me I ruined the whole day. In the past I've tried to talk to him about it with compassion and understanding of his past but also trying to say his actions aren't okay and that he can communicate differently. He doesn't really apologize or take accountability and always comes back to how draining my incompetence is. I've gotten to a point where I just shut down and don't say anything back, I fix whatever the mistake is silently and leave the room, but I think it just makes him think I'm more pathetic. 

I'm feeling pathetic too because I know I don't want to be treated this way but there's so much I love about and don't feel ready to give up on in my life with him. I also am starting to feel really childish (I'm in my 30s) and dependent for making so many mistakes or doing things imperfectly. I've worked really hard to keep from internalizing his words, I also can see that the more pressure he puts the more I fumble as I'm more on edge (he tells me that's an excuse), but my internal boundaries and voice are also failing me and I am hating on myself a lot right now. 

He wouldn't stop me from leaving (maybe he'd even be happy about it-which also makes me feel pathetic) and I'm thinking about it a bit but I just don't feel ready, it's going to be a lot to grieve. There's also a part of me that wants to figure out and fix what is wrong with me that I can't do things ""right"" (even if I don't think it's a binary or that his standards are inherently right) because I can understand why if he needs to micromanage me why that's exhausting and frustrating.

I have been the sole parent managing every aspect of my child’s life. My son has autism, and I handle all of his medical care, therapy, IEP meetings, school issues, and daily routines—completely alone. His father has always been in his life, but he has never been a real parent. He has never taken responsibility for Ryder’s healthcare, disability services, therapy, or even his basic day-to-day needs. I have done everything. He has every other weekend access.

I am in a parenting agreement I never wanted. When I was able to afford a lawyer, I had already filed for joint  due to the coercive control. It was the only way to end some means of the abuse and two years later, even with the court mandated app it’s still happens. I have worked with domestic violence advocates. I have everything documented, but it just seems like no one cares. I have primary custody, was never married and have final say if we can’t agree. Which is inappropriate for our situation because he has never collaborated or educated himself on our child’s disability/ raising a child.  

I also have a temporary restraining order against his father and need to protect myself and my son. The OOP was only granted to me, court is coming up. Again, another lawyer that says “just keep documenting”. Being fully dedicated to my son’s care while losing everything is exhausting. I feel trapped. The school district we are in isn’t great with truly being inclusive. 

I need to relocate out of New York State to a place where we can be safe and where my son will have access to better autism services and schools. But I know I need to do this the right way legally, especially with custody involved. I own my home but can’t afford it. My savings have all ran out and I had to resign from getting back to work for the first time since becoming mama because lack of support and exhaustion. My body has been in fight or flight for so long, it’s effecting my health. 

I’ve reached out to every program in my area. DV Advocates, pro bono lawyers, local law school….since I’m not being hit and our child isn’t being physically abused, my case doesn’t take precedence. 

I continue to heal and keep walking back into an active fire. I don’t doesn’t this. Our child doesn’t deserve this. ",2025-03-07 05:13:32,2025-03-17 02:06:45,all_new_posts

One of my mothers good friends who I grew up around and spent a lot of time with as a kid, was murdered by her eldest son. 

I used to babysit this child, he’s the same age as my nephew. He was always a problem child, he even tried to suffocate his baby brother when he was like 5 or 6 years old. 

His mother, Astrid was the kindest most soft spoken sweet gentle woman and one of my mother’s friends that I particular favored as she was always so nice to us. I’ve known her since I was about 8 years old, I’m over 30. She and her husband were a great couple. Loving parents. Loving spouses. He was also very sweet.  
My mother knew her since before she got married and had her kids and this family. Now we are watching this gut wrenching news that her family has ended and been torn apart in this way. 

They are giving the mentally health excuse but I feel the kid is just evil. A psychopath. While mental health has something to do with it, obviously….i do believe he knew what he was doing. I feel sick to my stomach. My mother is devastated and I can’t begin to imagine how her husband (who found her dead) feels as well as her other younger son.

Im sorry this is so long, i honestly just needed to get these thoughts out. If anyone has any recommendations or suggestions please feel free to reach out ",2025-03-07 03:57:11,2025-03-17 02:06:49,all_new_posts

I hadn't thought of it in years until I saw on social media that he'd died unexpectedly. Suddenly, every single memory came back like I was actually there. This went on for 3 or 4 days. Total trip!

I would really appreciate anything you all might be willing to share about what your abusive partner was like when you first met, \[edit and, red flags you missed/ignored. I am terrified of dating because I don't want to fall for someone like that again. (He felt like a kindred spirit I'd always known.... I have been single since this happened.)

1j5e490,Still file a DVRO from an incident 1.5 months ago?,Helpful_Ad1571,2,2025-03-07 03:24:13+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j5e490/still_file_a_dvro_from_an_incident_15_months_ago/,"My ex barged into my home, and then into my room to grab my daughter, who had been refusing to go with him for the last few times it was his day with the kids. Despite my attorney warning his attorney, and me warning him over email that if he continues to do this, we will get an RO against him. He continued to enter my home at least 3-4 times after, again despite my attorney's reminders to his.

We have been living separately for 6 months now and I filed for divorce in Jan this year.

These incidents happened ~ 1 month ago, and at the time my then attorney was dead against filing a DVRO. I changed attorneys, and the new one is open to the idea.

However, I have sent emails to him using abusive language in the last year. Also about a year ago, tired of his abuse over 16 years, I sent him an email saying I will break his head into a million pieces, and he responded saying he is locking himself up in his study for his safety and if I come near him he will get a restraining order. Of course nothing happened.

I have called the cops on him twice last year- once for him threatening to ""bring me to the road"" and another one for yelling like a madman- extremely threateningly at me.

He also ran away with our kids passports one day before scheduled travel last May, and then continued to withhold my access of them for months.

Given that the barging incident happened a while ago, and he seems to be behaving himself since then- can I still file for a DVRO and obtain it? Also can he file a counter DVRO using me (reactive) abusive emails? I'm very scared for my safety given his aggression. I switched attorneys recently and can use that to file DVRO saying I was trying to find a competent and supportive attorney and couldn't file earlier because of that?",2025-03-07 03:24:13,2025-03-17 02:06:51,all_new_posts

At the same time, I wish someone had warned me and it made me hurt knowing some people actually knew and so it drew me deeper into staying like he told me I was the problem. 

Did you warn or tell anyone? Did you tell future partners? Or I’ve been reading some people who connect with their exes as well, and it helps.

My clothes, my jewelry, my handmade quilts, gifts from my family, my drawings, my animals toys, my old school paperwork, even my high school diploma. 

I got everything of my baby’s out and brought it with me, but it feels like I left everything that I am and was before his abuse behind. 

I think what bothers me even more is that I know he’s going to keep it, just to upset me. He did the same thing to his ex wife, obsessing over her, hoarding her belongings just to keep them from her. What he doesn’t feel emotional satisfaction from hoarding, he’ll sell to fuel his drug problem.

And have been free of my (42M) ex. 
I was a teenager when we met so there was grooming etc it was all very weird I’m not gonna go into detail but that’s that. Last year I finally was able to get him to leave but I had been financially supporting him most our relationship. He’s a total leech and was financially abusing me among other things. 

Since therapy I’ve been able to work through this and have the courage to cut him off completely. It’s been a struggle especially the last few months he hasn’t been cooperative bc I’m not fawning or supporting him so it’s been harder than it needs to be when it comes to phone and internet providers cause it’s all under his name and info but it’s being charged to my cards. I’ve reported so many cards stolen and as fraud and today another reaccuring charge went through that shouldn’t have (AT&T internet that I’m no longer using) and I called and the lady was so mean and was trying to accuse me of lying about my situation and wouldn’t let me cancel the account. 
Eventually I was crying and said (sarcastically) thank you so much for trying to help someone in a domestic violence situation trying to regain their autonomy “ and she literally said “ya you’re welcome “ and I hung up. 

I’m gonna re report that card as stolen and fraud and cancel the account this time but idk what to do with the AT&T equipment and stuff like I don’t know what to do they won’t take it back. 

TLDR: anyone have experience with not being in control of accounts linked to your card and how to get away from them specifically internet/phones ",2025-03-06 22:57:33,2025-03-17 02:06:55,all_new_posts

1j55wdq,Long vent. Exhausted and frustrated with it all,IllMango552,2,2025-03-06 20:57:00+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j55wdq/long_vent_exhausted_and_frustrated_with_it_all/,"Just needing to vent, I’m frustrated with the legal system and dealing with the fact that there will likely be minimal consequences.

I dated her for about three months and when I ended things, it all went to hell. Suddenly she’s pregnant, then having a miscarriage. All the tests came back negative and she was drinking before telling me she was pregnant but after she said she knew she was pregnant. She’s the  showing up at my job to talk to my boss, coming by my apartment unannounced (repeatedly) to attempt to enter and talk to me while also assaulting me in the process. I got texts and instagram messages from her and her friends about how terrible a person I was.

I got a protection order, which she promptly violated to vandalize my car twice, attempting to hire a locksmith to break into my apartment, confronting me in the courthouse to say she was going to file false rape allegations of I pursued the protection order. I moved and she bought a new car and followed me to my new place and slashed my tires, stole my Amazon packages, and then attempted to use a drill to break through the back door. I had set up a camera by this point and she got arrested and is facing charges.

I’m of the opinion the charges are the weakest possible ones they could get away with giving her. Two misdemeanor charges for violating a protection order and criminal tampering for trying to drill out the video camera because there wasn’t sufficient damage. Her plea bargain, I’m being told, is a very standard DV offer of 24 months probation with screening for DV counseling.

I just feel deflated since the DA’s office gives me a runaround whenever I try to talk to them. They say I have the right as the crime victim to consult with them at certain stages and they just don’t contact me until it’s too late and say “oops, we can do better, what a good learning opportunity for us!”

I just feel powerless in the whole process. I feel I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. She lies to the court about her location so she can attend virtually. I attend the hearings in person so I can give a victim impact statement to try to make there be a modicum of consequences. She’s talking about moving out of state to go home and I doubt the probation will be serious enough to travel, since it’s a misdemeanor. I’m exhausted with how this drags on and how nothing has happened to her except one night in jail.

There have been minimal consequences for her, and I feel incredibly limited since as a male victim I have to be IMMACULATE in my behavior or else there will be the defense twisting it that I’m not an angel and she’ll get off completely Scot-free. I just don’t know what to do and need to vent about this.

There’s been issues since the beginning but being dumb I overlooked them.. this is only my second relationship ever. We were long distance at first, he traveled to meet me and then I traveled to see him a month later, he fell on hard times and I stupidly allowed him to stay with me and my parents back in June. He was at our house a few months before my mother put him out & he went to a homeless shelter in my city where’s he been living ever since. As I said theres been issues in the relationship already as far as countless arguments, name calling, controlling behavior etc. It started getting physical back in July. We’ve had at least 4  physical altercations in the past 8-9 months. A few days ago we went to the bar together. I got up to use the bathroom and when I came back there was another man sitting quite close to him but he was talking to the bartender so I didn’t think much of it. I sat down and my boyfriend kept telling me to move over but I thought he was being funny so I didn’t. The man at the bar started arguing with everyone my boyfriend included. My boyfriend then started getting more aggressive with the man AND ME, calling me a bitch and saying he’ll slap me in front of everyone. We left like 10-15 mins later. He said I wasn’t on his side and was trying to get attention from the other men and kept talking about how bad he would’ve beaten the man in the bar.. as we’re walking to my house he’s talking shit to me and I’m trying to ignore him. He eventually hits me in the back of my head while standing in front of me trying to prevent me from going another way. He walked the whole way home about 4 blocks just hitting me. Pulling my hair.. pushing me.. actually ended up pushing me down to the ground in the snow and mud and when I said it was over he snatched my purse and my phone. Covered my mouth and tried to choke me multiple times so I wouldn’t scream and draw attention. Said I was tryna get him in trouble. It was midnight at that point. I tried to get him an uber home but he refused so I just kept the peace and let him stay until the next day.. I grew up seeing my mother deal with domestic violence and now I’m going through the same thing. I just want him to move back to his home state because as long as he’s here and as long as I’m the only person he knows out here I’m going to feel responsible for him. He also hasn’t gotten a job or an apartment in the 9-10 months he’s been here so I’ve been supporting him financially as well. How do I leave?? What do I do?? I have no one to talk to about this. There’s a lot more to the story but I’d be here forever 💔 I just want to be myself again. I have no freedom and I’m losing the few friends that I did have.

1j4ye9t,How to stop the intrusive insults,ComprehensiveTie7624,2,2025-03-06 15:45:52+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j4ye9t/how_to_stop_the_intrusive_insults/,"When I was with my ex husband, he was incredibly verbally, mentally, and emotionally abusive. Sometimes the physical abuse was sprinkled here and there. For the most part, everything was the verbal, mental and emotional. 

My ex husband always wanted me thinner than what I was. He saw pictures of me in college and said that if I could have been that skinny for my ex, I could be that skinny for him, too. Mind you, I went from taking dancing classes, walking all over campus, and barely sitting to ONLY sitting at a desk 8 hours of the day. So of course I gained weight. Mind you, at the time we got together, I was 160lbs at 5’6”. Yea, for me I was in the heavy side compared to what I was in college but I had gotten myself down around 135-140, still slightly heavier than college but a healthy weight. 

My ex husband would always criticize what I ate. Even if it was healthy. He would tell me to just stop eating by if I wanted to lose weight and called it a “diet.” I would eat carrot and hummus and he said that it would make me fat and guilt me into stop eating it and then stop buying it altogether. If he saw I was eating something he would say “being a little piggy, are we?” He would say this in a cutesy and playful tone, but it still hurt me considering every time we were angry and fighting, he would flat out call me fat. 

Before my 30th birthday (two days before I left him) I mentioned how I wanted a mug of ice cream, which mind you I never do because I just never had much of a sweet tooth to begin with, but I did this night. He then told me I shouldn’t if I want to look good on our trip to Cancun and that I’ve gained weight. When I decided not to eat it because I was hurt (he didn’t say this in a nice way, hence why I was hurt) he said that I was being dramatic and made me feel worse. 

For the most part, I feel I’ve recovered from the mental abuse he’s put me through but now I have a complicated relationship with food. I’m always mentally keeping track of what I eat and how much. Sometimes I keep healthy snacks at work to munch on every now and then. Sometimes when I do (just now, for the third time which is what prompted me to post this), I have that memory of him in my head calling me a “little piggy” and how the one time I told him I was 130, he then said “now get to 125” without even hesitating. I then feel guilty for eating and basically eat nothing for the rest of the day. 

I left my ex husband in May of 2023. My new boyfriend who is a health nut and loves the gym has recognized this with me and tries to encourage me to eat because I need to and that what I’m eating is not at all unhealthy. He’s supportive but I cannot seem to shake the food guilt my ex husband has instilled in me. 

Does anyone have any advice? ",2025-03-06 15:45:52,2025-03-17 02:07:01,all_new_posts

And one day, I just got the light at the end of the tunnel and I ran. 

In a year here's what's happened:

-I got a job and steadily payed off the debt that my abuser put me in
-I bought a car! Talk about freedom!
-I finally blocked him on EVERYTHING
-I went to therapy and built a support system
-I slowly rebuilt the family and friendships my abuser had cut me off from. Some I couldn't get back, but most I did.
-I met my partner. I never knew men could be so kind, patient, and gentle. Even my therapist is amazed on our relationship. We are planting a vegetable garden together this weekend. 
-I finally can tell my story. He doesn't scare me anymore and I can scream his name and what he did.

I like the idea of being near family but my family lives near his family and he knows where all my family live and so I don't necessarily know that should be my top choice either. So at this point I'm open to almost anywhere. I am trying to find a shelter that has rooms for the mom and kids to stay together just themselves (so not open floor for everyone type of thing) and somewhere that takes pets or provides shelter or foster care for the pets. My dogs have been one of my biggest hurdles with leaving and I won't leave them here to be killed by my husband who absolutely hates them.

He has had a past of alcoholism and I caught him drunk and he terrorized me and our 8 week old baby. He smashed my computer when i tried to reach someone for help and hid my phone. He took our baby from me and was holding him in scary ways and wouldn't give him back to me. I called 911 and the police arrested him and are charging him with ""wrongs to a minor"" ""destruction of property"" and ""disturbance of the peace"". He was released from jail and his staying with his brother and the state has a protection probation on him so he can't have access to me or our baby until his case is over.

This is the first time he scared me, and his behavior taking our baby and trying to scare me with him (he left him on the couch face down when i was trying to call 911 from the other room). I'm very scared being a single mom but I make good money and have one month left of maternity leave before I have to figure out childcare. My gut tells me to run for the hills but any and all advice navigating DV with such a young baby would be appreciated.

For reference I have tried to get him to be sober for years. I left him while I was pregnant and he went to a 30 day outpatient program but has been drinking in secret since I believe. ",2025-03-06 12:28:08,2025-03-17 02:07:06,all_new_posts

The relationship is over, but I say stbx because I'm trying to figure out a lawyer to get my marriage annulled. 

My son's injury is consistent with SBS. My stbx claimed he fell onto his steel toe boot but my son literally cries if he bops himself in the nose with his own hand. He never cried and I never heard a thud. I was calling 911 to get him help due to him breathing hard. 

I talked with a cop after filing a dvp (got denied because the clerk didn't want to help me with filling it out and didn't explain it to me) and he got it bumped to state level and talked with a prosecutor. I have a feeling that my stbx is going to jail soon as the entire city of Spencer police were looking for him and stalking the Ann Street apartments in Spencer too. 

I'm being harassed by his family to drop the charges or to not press charges because ""he can't help it. It was just one time."".

Tonight he came home drunk again and I tried kicking him out of the room because he smelled like alcohol and I wanted space, we got into an argument and he choked me twice. I tried to chat on the DV helpline but they just sent me informational on strangulation and how to contact my doctor. I’ve been wanting to leave. It’s not the first time he’s been this violent. I just want to report him and file a restraining order. I don’t wanna call the cops right now bc it’s 3am and don’t wanna cause a scene and wake up my neighbor.

But when he is unhappy we all feel it in the home. His temper is short, he shouts and he has zero patience and honestly it scares me.

We have an almost 2 year old little girl and he gets so angry with her if she wakes up in the night and if she doesn’t go back to sleep he swears at her. I don’t even want him touching her because I’m scared. I have worries that one day he will hit her out of frustration.

I don’t know what to do because when I mention this all to him he gets angry at me, closes himself off and doesn’t talk to me. I don’t know where to go or what to do and my work is being affected. If we have a bad morning and we argue about how he has spoken to our daughter I don’t trust him to look after her when I’m at work, I end up taking time off work because I’m scared of what will happen.

I can’t keep going on like this but I don’t know what to do, the highs are great but the lows are awful. Please help, I’m in the UK btw ",2025-03-06 06:41:19,2025-03-17 02:07:12,all_new_posts

A couple weeks ago we got in an argument/fight. It ended with him repeatedly pushing and shoving me over our couch and kitchen table. I had one finger that was a little busted up but nothing too bad. 
Teenage daughter called the police, he was arrested. I filed an OP. I was granted temporary, we had our OP hearing yesterday. It was extended 3 months. 
Daughter and I are safe at a friend’s place. We’re able to stay as long as I want. 

I’m struggling so bad with my emotions. I feel like I’ve overreacted. I’m second guessing my choices. I miss him. I love him. I only have a couple of friends to talk to and they have lives. My circle has become very small over the years. I feel like I’m always talking and whining about myself and I’m trying not to bombard them. 

I can’t stop crying anytime I’m alone. There’s a long waiting list for counseling. I just feel very alone, sad, angry, and confused rn. 

Husband is not daughter’s bio. He’s been around since she was 2. Bio dad was extremely physically abusive (and verbally, emotionally, financially, etc). I left him when I was pregnant. 

I’m carrying on but I feel so fxking heavy. 

I just want to curl up in his arms and get out of this nightmare.

I just posted this in r/Advice, but I'm editing a bit to fit this sub, because I know I'm in a violent relationship.

I want to change my life situation.
I am a divorced 34/F mother of two teens. My ex is in jail because he was physically violent towards us, so my kids get no alimoney or anything of the sort. 
I have BPD and got manipulated into a new relationship too fast, and we live with my new partner now. We have lived here a couple of years, however, my partner is violent by being extremely controlling.
In my situation, I am barely able to leave the house on my own (which has resulted in me having no friends anymore), I am not allowed to wear skirts or dresses, I AM NOT ALLOWED TO SPEND TIME WITH MY CHILDREN (unless he specifically requests or allows it at a given moment), and he even has cameras inside the house all the time. He has to know everything we are doing, why, when and where, ALL THE TIME.

We have nowhere else to go, since I have no other family besides my kids and my mom, and they all live with me and depend on me. 

I do have a degree, but I never graduated, so I cannot work on that, and I cannot afford to graduate at the moment. My partner only ""let's"" me work from home or in odd small jobs that don't make him jealous or take too much of my time, since his excuse is that he pays for housing, groceries and all the basics. And I just got fired from the Home Office job that I had, and have been getting rejected from other similar jobs, so I'm getting desperate.

I have no savings because of some trouble with my ex and my ex lawyer that was handling my case against him (the lawyer turned against me and they joined forces to scam me). So I'm also in HUGE debt and need to pay that off, which means I am completely broke right now and have no way to invest in a business or something like that.

I know that there are refugees and houses for battered spouses, but, at least in my country, they are overcrowded places that are unsafe and unsanitary, and because of my degree I have been close to some horror stories about those places.

I also feel so old to begin a new life...

I don't know what to do to better our situation, but I know we deserve better. Do you have any advice or similar stories?
Thank you!",2025-03-06 01:36:30,2025-03-17 02:08:19,all_new_posts
1j4g2pb,Not sure what to do about younger sister,UsedExtension,3,2025-03-05 22:30:34+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j4g2pb/not_sure_what_to_do_about_younger_sister/,"I am 34 and my sister is 23. We don’t physically live in the same house, but it is my parents and I am on their property in my own place with my child and pets (since my ex and I split, I had no where to go). My sister is unstable and always has been the person you avoid. She has gotten physically violent with my step dad, other sister, mother, and now me. I have let her have a basic relationship with my daughter, who is 5, meaning she will make things for her or they will paint together, etc. I am always there. 

She has gotten on me before for really no reason and today wasn’t much different. I went to take a shower (I use theirs because my hot water heater is ridiculous and Idk how to fix it yet), but she was in the bathroom. I asked “you taking a shit?” (lol) and she told me that it was her house and she can shit wherever she wanted. I was like wow, ok, i just wanted to know how long you’d take lol and brushed it off. She kept going but I just ignored it and waited. I was running late for work so I immediately went into the bathroom, but my sister asked my daughter to paint. I said no because I’m in a hurry and maybe later. She argued with me. My kid ran away shouting for us to stop fighting over her. I went and got her, I wasn’t listening to what my sister was still going on about, then took her to the bathroom. My kid had a little fit while I showered but then eventually came and started giggling and playing with the water. My sister walked up to the door and told me my kid is going to hate me when she grows up. I just said huh but then ignored it.

Later, I got out and dressed and popped my head into her room and said I was tired of her saying things like that and I needed to go to work so I couldn’t let her play. She told me my behavior was disgusting and all I did was punish my kid for the fact that she was rude to me earlier. I was like, ok whatever. You can’t always get what you want and I actually told her that maybe if she said please, I would let her play really fast. She said she wasn’t going to argue in front of my kid. I told her it wasn’t an argument and I didn’t want her to talk to my kid anymore. She kept yelling it, I kept asking if she heard me. She slammed the door on me, but my foot had been in the doorway and it didn’t close. She grabbed a spray bottle and sprayed me directly in my eyes. I kneed her and pushed her away because I didn’t know what it was. (Keep in mind, I didn’t go in on her because she is nearly 6’ and I am 5’2.) She called the police and stated she wanted to charge me with assault and call CPS. I told her she was a horrible person and I was tired of it (callback to the times she said I am a horrible mother and pet owner bc my rats got an upper respiratory infection and passed. Like, ok kid.) I called my girls grandma to pick her up bc I didn’t want her there for this.

I waited. Cops came. First two cops split, one with her and one with me, before a third showed up and stayed with me and the other cop. They were sympathetic and had actually looked it up and saw she had actually been barred from the property at one point, too. Cops traded places and the one she had first was not too kind but this isn’t the first time the cops have been called, so whatever. Told me that any time she has had the cops called on her in the past is irrelevant, and the fact that my foot was in her room nullified any complaint I had against her and made her in the right. My mom also told her that if she really did call the cops, then she wouldn’t be allowed to live there. Apparently, the simple threat is actually against the law and they are contacting my mother about that bc we need to officially evict her. My step dad was home and he corroborated my side, including that this is usually how a day goes normally, if not with me then someone else. 

I am a full adult, trying to protect my kid, and I am too old for this. She tried to use that against me, even though she is an adult too. I don’t know what my kids dad is going to do. We do not have a civil relationship, really, because he has only decided to be more involved within the last year or so. 

What have you done? What do I do? I know my mom can evict her, but would I be able to get an order for her to stay away if she does?  Considering this was her calling on me, does that mean an order isn’t even worth the effort? My step dad and mother spoke just last week about the option of getting her out of the house, but my mom is such a sucker for her because shes unwell. Like, I know she is, but she is also unsafe. My mom told her she felt abused by my sister and my sister flew off the handle. I’m at a complete loss. ",2025-03-05 22:30:34,2025-03-17 02:08:20,all_new_posts

So I put together an Excel spreadsheet of the incident dates, reported report number, etc. to prepare myself in case I do end up moving forward with a protection order. Anyway, the pattern that I saw was every two to three months, his behavior escalates resulting in a report filed with local law enforcement or other authoritative body. Seeing this pattern really brought home for me what has been happening and also helping me see that I am not the crazy one. That the moments of calm are timed out just enough so I let my guard down again. The last incident occurred last weekend, nearly 2 months, almost to the day of the last incident. I just wanted to share this for others who may find it useful. Once you start documenting in a logical way, you will likely see patterns emerge as well. Sending everyone a giant hug today.

1jcsndx,Has resorted to using literal torture tactics like sleep deprivation,grandpagrandpa1,1,2025-03-16 18:52:02+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcsndx/has_resorted_to_using_literal_torture_tactics/,"It’s gotten to the point where I am able to figure out when he starts fighting just to fight with me, and I won’t engage. So now he’s resorted to punishing me by bringing my close familial relationships and other triggering info into the fights that is in no way relevant. I’m used to the regular slew of insults and garbage. Last night was absolutely insane and a step further into more crazily abusive territory.

He fought with me for TWELVE hours. He started with me at 9 PM, accusing me of being in a “bad mood” when absolutely nothing was wrong. Fought with me until almost 3 AM. I desperately tried to disengage and end things. I fell asleep for 3 hours. He woke me up at 6 AM, and fought with me until 9:30 AM, forcing me to stay awake. He did all this so that he wouldn’t have to do something for me today that we had planned to do all week. I called him out at the beginning of the fight and said, “are you picking a fight with me so you don’t have to [do this thing for me] tomorrow?” He easily proved me right.

I quickly debunked everything he was arguing about and finally lost my mind because he you can only be told you ain’t shit and deprived of sleep for so long. I called him out on his own bullshit and he couldn’t handle it, so he went back to his usual DARVO responses “you don’t love me 😤” “you hate me 😤” “you don’t give a shit about me 😤” “you’re so ungrateful 😤.” And it’s so funny when I pull up conversations of me being the world’s greatest most loving attentive thankful girlfriend. 

I’m so fucking beyond exhausted, they are energy vampires and not allowing me to physically sleep was absolute insanity. I’m used to being abused and torn to shreds but I’m not used to literal physical torture. Especially because I take prescribed sleep/anxiety medication that makes it harder for me to stay awake, causing confusion and also rendering the medication useless because my adrenaline fights through it. Then I have to take more to achieve sleep/fight intense panic, putting me in a negative position with my doctor and pharmacy. ",,,

I asked him if he wanted to go look at it while i do the chores and see if it was something we wanted to get the truck out for. The truck is parked behind some things so figured he can see if it’s worth digging the truck out. 

He said no and he wanted to go with me, so I said something along the lines of I don’t know what would be considered a good freezer and we can kill two birds with one stone while he looked at it and I did chores. He just said in an annoyed tone “well never mind we don’t need to get it”. I got annoyed because he always does this rolled my eyes and left the car without saying anything (likely closed the door a little hard but not slamming it) and started getting the groceries out of the trunk. 

He got out slammed his door and said “you’re always such a bitch to me” and I again said I thought you can look at it and come back, if we want it we can get the truck out and go back together. 

He’s now giving the cold shoulder and I can’t stop crying. I really don’t think it was wrong to ask him to go look while I handle the other things, but I can’t stop thinking what my role is in this. ",,,

Apparently he gave her three days to leave, turned off the electricity in their place so she would move out (paid for it to be shut off and then paid for it to be turned on after she left), stole some of her stuff, and tried to defame her to the people close to her. I'm not sure if any abuse took place before this, from the rest of her posts about their relationship she seemed happy. 

He threatened to kick me out multiple times and held my housing over my head almost daily, knowing I didn't have a safe place to go to. I feel really bad for her. I also feel like I could've done something to prevent this if I had just reached out and told her he's abusive.   ",,,

I’m expecting a fight about custody but gathering evidence of abuse so hopefully I can get primary custody and get supervised visitations for dad. But will it be easier doing this alone? I’m used to walk on egg shells at home - kids can’t be too noisy or messy, we have to do what husband says or he gets angry, and if the kids don’t show him affection (hugs, say hi, talk to him when HE wants it) then he gets angry, takes away rights (phone, tv, toys) or gives the silent treatment/ignore them. I’m hoping it’ll be easier to just do it all alone but I’m also afraid I’m glorifying it? Like he does do some chores and a little of the child caring.

We have two dogs that I’m expecting him to take, so at least cleaning will be less… but will it be easier after it all settles down? I’m so scared. Ive been with him almost half my life. I am not sure I remember who I was before he started shaping me into who I am now… and I don’t like who I am with him. I see glimpses of myself when he’s not around - the goofy girl who dances and sings loudly and likes to be creative… the one who isn’t afraid of his opinions. Who eats healthy food because she actually likes it instead of the same few junk food recipes that he likes… the one who does creative projects with the kids because she isn’t afraid of the mess… the one who goes foraging in the forest for hours because he won’t scold her about choosing her hobbies over him, or who doesn’t have to cut it short because he got bored… the one who actually spends time with her family without being scared of staying too long or going too often because he gets angry… the one who can talk to a male colleague without being scared of the silent treatment afterwards… the one who dresses nicely and puts on makeup because she doesn’t have to defend herself and assure him she isn’t cheating… 

sorry this turned into a rant. I just want to know if it gets easier? ",,,
1jcqowk,Bf wants me to be friends with his ex to sabotage her,Professional-Mood297,0,2025-03-16 17:28:02+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcqowk/bf_wants_me_to_be_friends_with_his_ex_to_sabotage/,"So I (20F) helped my bfs (23M) ex into rehab at the beginning of this year. And while I did it because I didn't want this girl to get trafficked (she came close to being trafficked), and I didn't want her dying... I don't want to be her friend. And important context, she is his parents' next door neighbor so you can see her car if you're over there. And he asked me to literally be friends with her and he wants me to fuck up her life from the inside. And I asked him how the hell I would even do that, and what he was on about. He told me that he wants me to convince her to get behind the wheel while really drunk. And that he hates seeing that car, and a big reason he was talking to her while we were on break was because he loved her car, and it's supposed to be his (even though her mom bought it for her) And it annoyed the hell outta me, because you mean you put me through all that stress not only for an ex, but for a CAR. He has a nice convertible already, I really don't get it??? 

This could all be an effed up joke, but it's wild to say in the first place. But I really don't know if he was being serious or not. 

Also this all started because she called him from a textnow number and started saying that he was holding the rehab thing over her head, and that triggered him. And that she thought him and his brother was following her, which he claims isn't true, they were just leaving at the same time. And I know he went to go play basketball with his friends so idk. ",,,

1jcp1nz,Controlling behavior escalated to something physical,hiss_terical,1,2025-03-16 16:16:44+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcp1nz/controlling_behavior_escalated_to_something/,"My husband and I have been together for a long time. Things were worse in the beginning when we both were heavy drinkers, but we both quit and things got better. I used to have to lock him out of a bedroom because he would follow me around screaming at me. Recently, he's been pushing me to work more and I'm also going to school. I am busy a stupid number of hours a week...60+ between school and work. He wanted me to go back to school, but then started complaining because I'm not doing enough housework and not being intimate with him, both emotionally and physically. It feels like the goal posts are always changing and more and more and more is being demanded of me, no matter how much I'm already doing. I'm exhausted. Burnt out. 

We got into a fight and I left to cool down and pick up my meds from the pharmacy. I got a nasty ""where the fuck do you think you're going?"" text, and then he decided to leave to go out drinking. When finally came home hours later, he demanded to see my phone, accusing me of cheating on him because I left. He woke me up screaming at me, and then fought me for my phone, wrestling it away from me. The kids heard it all. I took the kids and left. I haven't been back. 

He's begging to reconcile, and some part of me wants to believe it was only the alcohol that caused  the violence, but even before that our relationship had many issues. I don't know if there's any way for this to get better. And I can't stomach the thought of living with him again, or normalizing this behavior for our children. Or putting in more work and effort when I'm already so exhausted. Everything he texts me about is pushing to meet up, talking about how hard this is on him, and I still feel like I'm getting no consideration. He's being extra nice, but it feels fake. I feel like he just wants me back in the house with the kids, and nothing else (my feelings, my trauma, my happiness, the kids' wellbeing) matters as long as he can return to normal.

I just don't know where to go from here. I mean, I know, but I'm having a hard time. I feel like I'm stuck in limbo. I guess I just wanted to make a post in a space where people would understand. Thanks for listening. ",,,

Ex was sent back from work yesterday and I didn't realize how drunk he was before leaving, as he usually leaves when I come home from work. He came back from work after being sent home, and our car was messed up because he had ran over a mailbox. He came back crying and I immediately knew something was wrong.  

He had stopped for another beer and had it cracked open. He was crying and freaking out and I tried to calm him down and get him inside to drink water and sleep it off. But he immediately turned angry when he got out of the car and his screaming alerted a neighbor. Well, the neighbor watched and waited to intervene until she saw him swing on me. He hit me twice and I feel like I egged him on because I told him to back up and not do it because his probation would be screwed. He was on probation for strangulation and assault where we cut off complete communication until he was solidly in therapy and attending classes. 

Well, he fled. It was dark and we live out in a very rural area. The state police searched for an hour with two people before leaving. 

He came inside and a camera caught him so the police were called again. A very unprofessional officer told me I could be charged with aiding and abetting (? Correct spelling) if I didn't call and he showed up. I proceeded to explain I didn't know what kind of mood he was in and I wouldn't be able to call them if he simply shows up and dude rolled his eyes. The second time, they showed up with four-five state police officers, only one was a woman. They left after two hours.

The third time they showed up,  he fled somewhere new. I wanted this to be over because it was around four in the morning and I didn't want our little one to wake up (she's 3). I communicated with police that I would throw a blanket and hoodie outside for him and where he would be and they didn't catch him then. The same officer that threatened me with a charge on the last visit then demanded that I quit playing games and tell them where he went. Again, I didn't know. I had an inkling of an idea, but they were searching the few streets around here and not the woods like I'd said. 

The last final time he was caught inside, hiding in a crawlspace in our house. He came back to say goodbye to our daughter and apologized for his actions even though  💯 know he would do it again. 

The same officer was there and I can't remember the last stupid comment he made, but I finally threatened to file a complaint. It took them 45 minutes to get here from one town over (a 20 minute drive). He apparently was the Sargeant. 

I just feel insanely guilty and depressed. I was on the phone with him for 6 hours that night, and he wouldn't tell me where he was, but I wanted to listen to see if or when he'd be caught and he wanted to talk about things we had repressed during prior arguments. He hasn't called from jail yet, and I feel like I'm going through the motions but not really here. I'm taking care of my daughter but not myself, and now have to worry about daycare and a new vehicle... And I feel horrible and I miss him and I know I shouldn't.  I just keep remembering how awful it felt to be on the phone with him, just waiting like that and our last hug and I know he wouldn't be violent towards our kid ever, but now I'm fucked up inside because he'll be in there 4 years if not longer with new charges.

1jcogvv,Am I being abused,,1,2025-03-16 15:51:28+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcogvv/am_i_being_abused/,"I didn’t know what to title this post because it’s a lot and I will probably end up deleting..

My fiance (27M) and I (25F) have been together for about 7 years, since our late teens. In that time, we have had some very crazy insane arguments. Currently now in our mid to late 20s, nothing is really wrong. But fiancé cannot stop bringing up the past to rehash and yell and belittle me over.

For the first few years of our relationship, I was very bad at communicating. I invalidated, and I name called, I escalated arguments, I did it all. He spent years calling it out to me and “beating it” into my brain so that I would stop these behaviors. And for the most part (aside from the random attitude or eye roll) I have stopped. And I’m thankful that he was consistent with me and helped me change , and I tell him this. He also uses this against me quite often currently, to make me feel exactly how you would think. Another situation that gets brought up often is when (3? Years ago I think) I texted a male coworker to play a video game together: flirting. Nothing more happened but that did betray his trust. When caught, I started an argument and name called. I admit to this every time he brings it up and apologize. He also was texting someone (6 Years ago) and had a plan to go over to their house for sex, but I’m not allowed to “use that against him” because when I caught him, he admitted it immediately and apologized. There’s a whole lot more that I can’t add in or this would be way too long. Things like him organizing and me having trouble keeping it clean (I’m the only one working) - this an excuse to yell at me. Me not being psychically affectionate enough (I’ve validated and I’m working on it). He says that he’s the reason our daughter is so considerate and the way she is and if left to me, she would be- fill in the blank with anything bad. If I even come inside the house and he perceives I have an attitude and I don’t get rid of it- argument. He has anger issues and punches things, yells at me, gets in my face, calls me names, these outbursts lasts for hours. While this is happening, I’m usually bawling my eyes out, listening, apologizing, telling him all the ways I will make up for it and make his life amazing. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. Last night he admitted he’s been having dreams of punching or choking me out and he can feel that it’s my fault. I’m nervous to even post this because what if he sees. And like I said, nothing new is happening because I’m a better partner now, but he has trauma. And I don’t know how to help I’m through it. He says if I just put a lens on where I enrich his life and he’s always at the front of my brain , maybe that will help. Honestly I don’t know why I’m even posting this, I just feel so helpless and hopeless right now. Does anyone have advice?",,,

He was wonderful for the rest of my pregnancy. Wonderful with our son.  I have so many photos of them together that now hurt to look at. 

The last two weeks have been horrendous. I actually thought his cruelty was caused by alcohol… it’s not. He’s been sober for about nine months. Having a baby was extremely motivating to stay on the straight and narrow. But time passed, he got stressed, and he got so unkind. 

He was yelling and screaming at me all day yesterday in front of our baby.  I’ve never felt so defeated. He bought alcohol for the first time in the evening and I only figured it out about an hour after he got home and screamed some more. 

I recorded it all and I finally tore the bandaid off and sent one of the videos to a friend who convinced me to leave. 

Last time he bent my hand back and hurt me. I was pregnant. This time I didn’t stick around long enough for him to touch me. 

I feel so so bad for taking my baby away from his father. He loves his baby. 

The whole thing was humiliating. I was in a hotel lobby crying with a screaming baby going through all my bags looking for my credit card. My phone was blowing up and I was trying not to look. 

Then we get to our room and baby is inconsolable for about twenty minutes. I’m crying. I’m FaceTiming a friend whos also crying. Now this morning I can hear all the noises in the hotel and I know how thin the walls are and I’m just so mortified. 

I know it’s for the best but it feels so bad. I’m so scared he’s going to hurt himself. 

This is all his fault and he ruined everything with his actions but I feel like I’m the one who ripped our family apart and I can’t ever go back",,,

Our fights often includes him threatening to leave (I play into it and always end up stopping him- and when I admitted in a couples therapy session that sometimes I'm so tired that I think about letting him go, and he got mad and brought that up at a later fight (like bro- wtf)), but recently in lieu of that, he shouted he no longer wanted to do couples counseling and told me to cancel the appointment. Our relationship was always a bit rocky due to family issues but it seemed to really get bad in the past year or two.

Currently, we are almost a week in on him giving me the silent treatment, which is not super unusual when he gets mad but will often put it aside for household comments (bills, groceries, etc.). But the other day I mentioned something about groceries and he snapped at me, 'don't talk to me, text me if you need to.' The silent treatment escalated to straight up hostilely ignoring me, and this AM I told him morning, and asked how he was feeling, and he snapped again about texting him and not talking to him. I hear him talking to the cat and he's normal and sweet. He just texted me that this is how it's gonna be until further notice and to communicate only through text and that if I can't respect this boundary to let him know.

I know my normal meter is fucked up because of my own trauma and family issues (which is something I'm fixing with therapy, but my SO is impeding it a bit because I need to talk about us) but yeah... In all ways I feel like I've been set up to fail, feel no support and so weak, and I'm so sad.",,,

It’s people of both sexes. 

Yesterday, I had a rare day off and ended up at his party later. I went inside to use the restroom and eat and started chatting with two guys across the counter from me and asked how they knew him. He came in and got upset that I was “gone for 20 minutes” and what was I doing? He was insinuating I was up to something. He disappeared for a bit and then asked me to come to his room to discuss what I was doing. He didn’t seem satisfied that that’s what I was doing. He kept getting angry. Then he got pissed and asked me to leave. I went downstairs and was telling people bye, and he came down and pulled me physically away from them wanting to talk about this again. Yelling at me in front of people. He then hit me with his phone in the forehead. I walked out and left. 

After I left, I got a text from him saying “great seeing you. Let me know when you get home!” My mind was blown. Then, HE blocked ME on everything. Obviously, this is doing me a favor, but why would someone act this way, not apologize, and then block the person they hurt?

I told them to delete them and report it, but I had to explain to multiple friends what was going on, it’s stupid for him to get to me through my friends, they shouldn't have to worry about that and quite frankly I never wanted to discuss this with anyone again but since it's out there, I could really use some advice. I'd rather just forget it, but now I can't because he's making it everyone's business and messing up my social life. 

This is why I never post on social media and make my life very private. It took me hours to explain what was going on and it was humiliating, he forced my hand yet again and I'm still playing his games. I can barely do anything about it. I'm out of my mind. I don't know what to do. This has happened multiple times, but this time he is going after my friends. 

He has it set to a picture he took from me as well. I let my guard down and this happens. I'm at my wits end. I can't do it anymore. 

It's worth mentioning, on February 19, he harassed me and pretended to be someone else, I told him I couldn't do this and left him hanging. Then he made an account (different from this one) to send a long apology saying he never wanted to force me to engage with him, that he loves me, that I deserve better, and that I should block him after reading it. I ignored it. But instead of respecting his own words, he came right back to contact me again. That's the level of ""respect"" he has for me.

1jcka3t,I just need to vent…,Fit-Luck69,4,2025-03-16 12:23:18+00:00,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcka3t/i_just_need_to_vent/,"TW - Emotional abuse, drug addiction, gaslighting


Hi, 

Im sorry if this comes off as poorly written, I am emotional. didn’t want to acknowledge what I may be going through and I didn’t want to post here because it solidifies what my fear is. 

I think I am being abused. I suffered from abuse my childhood, my school life and in a few relationships as well. 

I thought I escaped it all. I told myself after my second last ex I’d never be abused again. What has happened now? I am with someone (who mind you, doesn’t even want to make it official yet) who just treats me like absolute fucking shit 90% of the time. 

I spoke to him for months and now have moved to another state to be with him. We spend basically everyday together for the last 4 months. 

He is just so disrespectful. He constantly critiques everything I do, constantly puts me down, blurts out completely rude insults/word vomit, lashes out on me, blames me for everything wrong, gaslights me when I tell him I’m upset and downplays it - then blames me, barely apologises, refuses to have any emotional conversations with me - I try to set boundaries and I’m a “snowflake” or he stonewalls me, he doesn’t care if I’m sad, he constantly is being defiant towards me and the list just go on and on…

He is a drug addict to one of the hardest drugs. I consistently blame the addiction on the way he treats me. I justify it to myself his actions because of his adhd, autism and addiction. He downplays me so much and says he’s “just joking” when he hurts me and that I’m too sensitive. I’m constantly apologising for lashing out back. When I speak politely asking not to treat me like that, it doesn’t work. I’ve started lashing out a lot because he won’t listen when I try to communicate kindly and maturely. 

He takes advantage of my kindness. I do everything for him. I have a full time job and he doesn’t work. I clean, I make him food or buy him food, I drive to places to get him stuff without him in the car. 

The guy doesn’t even like hugging or kissing me, he spends days awake playing games while I’m alone in bed. Not to mention he’s never touched me sexually - only me giving to him. He has a reason for this and I respect it. But still… sucks feeling so rejected often. He also doesn’t compliment me, never has called me pretty or beautiful. Closes is when I ask him if I look pretty or good and he says “yeah” very bluntly. 

The thing is, I’ve seen his good side when he was sober. He never love bombed me. When he’s sober he genuinely is so much better. I don’t know if it’s just the drugs or him in general. 

Why the fk do I allow myself to be treated like this? I’m too much of a coward to leave and be by myself. I’m constantly trying to improve myself mentally through therapy, groups, reading up, working on myself. 

I also sacrificed so much for him. I moved far away for him, I had cosmetic work done on myself to impress him (he never asked btw I just wanted to be perfect for him) I try so hard. 

I honestly feel so pathetic for staying. I feel pathetic that I can’t see a way out and I just hold on to hope that when he’s sober he’s better. I genuinely feel like I have no respect for myself and I feel so damn alone. I don’t tell anybody because it’s embarassing. I don’t want to tell people because it means it’s true. If he just showed that sensitive side he showed before when he was sober it would be all I need. I don’t ask for material items, I don’t ask for much honestly. He acts like showing me affection is an inconvenience. 

I just don’t understand how somebody can treat someone else like this. I feel like a shell of a person,  I just want to be loved. If I leave him I have nothing left. I’m stuck in this state until my lease ends at least and that’s not for awhile. I’d have nobody. I don’t want to leave him because I do love him so deeply. But I’m afraid that I’m being mistreated. 

And it’s crazy because I am so educated on abuse, and yet I make excuses. It’s like I’m turning a blind eye on it because of hope. 

I think I hold on too because he doesn’t show other typical sings. Like love bombing, jealousy or controlling behaviour. 

I wouldn’t wish this on anybody. I pray everyday that things will improve and I know my situation is nothing compared to others and I look like a fkn fool for staying. I know I’ll get shat on because it is my fault honestly. I don’t mean to sound like a victim or “pity me” but I’m being completely raw and transparent right now.  

I don’t know what the point of posting is since I don’t want to be told to leave him. I would like some success stories with people improving but we wouldn’t be on this subreddit if that was the case, plus I don’t want other people to get false hope in abusive situations either because that’s harmful. 

I have so much compassion and love for everybody else but myself. I am trying so hard to love myself and I just can’t. Never in my life. No matter what I’ve done. 

I hope there’s light at the end of the tunnel. I just want to be loved unconditionally with the same energy I give to them. I feel not good enough and like a waste of space. I sabotaged my life by moving here and staying with him after I saw the red flags. I knew and know better. ",,,

In the very beginning of the relationship my partner tried and succeeded to fast track the relationship. Which went against everything I believed in because of how my 14yr marriage with children ended. I always take things slow, I like to be friends first with a person I date first. I'm very old school in this department and have dated few men in my life, so far, and a couple of people for months and I never even became intimate with them(in any way) because it just never felt right or happened. My partner wanted me to give over all of my emotions and to act as if we had been dating for months, even though it had only been 2-3 weeks into the relationship and when I didn't that's when he began to tell me that there was something wrong with me. That I was emotionless, had no feelings. I was like a robot for being wary and wanting to taking things slow and get to know him better before I just gave over my heart and all the benefits and actions/behaviors that go with that. He told me that I should be texting him like every hour or so, with stuff like ""I'm thinking of you,"" or ""I miss you,"" and when I didn't or argued that what he was asking was a bit much and didn't seem reasonable. He would once again proceed to tell me that I'm the one who wasn't thinking correctly if I didn't agree with him and that something was wrong with me for not thinking like him. He would have expectations of me and want certain courtesies and behaviors from me that he, himself, wouldn't do, or think he shouldn't be required to have the same expectations or behaviors and this theme has continued through the entirety of our relationship, so far. Whenever we argued it was always me who's wrong and if he was ever wrong it could never be just his fault. It would also have to be partly my fault or I made him react the way he does. He constantly tells me I'm lying, when he has no proof I have been. He will tell me that I'm lying about things I'm thinking and feeling when there's no way he can even prove such things and will insist he's right even when I tell him what he's saying is incorrect. He constantly finds things about me to be upset with or to find fault with, even when everything is going fine, especially when everything is fine. Goes into my phone behind my back. Not that I care I have nothing to hide but will get worked up and anxious if I mention going into his phone like he has mine and will say only if he's there right next to me and can dictate what I can look at. He has put his hands on me 3 times. He's never punched or slapped me but the first time he forced me to kiss him, after an argument when he was leaving and I didn't want to and I was pulling my head away from him and out of his hands. Then he grabbed my head and forced me to look up while he forcefully kissed me and even hurt my mouth with how hard he did it. The 2nd time was in the car, and I told him to drop me at my place and that he wasn't to come in because we were arguing. When we got to my place and I tried to get out he gripped my jacket with both hands to point it was cutting into my arm and wouldn't allow me to get out of the car. I repeatedly tried to get out of his grip and out of the car for about 10 minutes before I slumped over and started crying because I realized I was helpless to do anything. Which reminded me of my very violent first marriage. My ex-husband put me in the hospital, raped me, and almost took my life and my partner knows this. So when he did what he did in the car it took me back to that horrible time in my life and I felt ashamed for feeling like I was back in the same situation. He finally let me out of the car and then proceeded to taunt me about not seeing any tears even though there's no way he could because I put my sunglasses on because mascara was all over, under my eyes, from crying so hard. Once I got to my apartment door I tried to shut the door on him but he slammed his foot in the doorway and I ended up just letting him in because I didn't want to make a scene with my neighbors right there. The 3rd time we were in bed and he hit me in the back with his vape because he thought I fell asleep smoking a cigarette in bed, which I hadn't. My back was to him and he couldn't see my face. When I addressed these situations with him, after they happened. He would tell me I was lying about how I felt and what I was thinking when he did what he did. Would say I was over exaggerating what occurred and that I was lying about him physically hurting me. To this day he sees nothing wrong with what he did in those situations. Even though he knows what happened to me in my past. I'm going to stop here for now. There is more stuff but he'll be getting up soon. Some feedback would be great because as he sees it and keeps telling me it's me that's the entire problem in the relationship. He's been relentless about calling me a narcissist, insisting that I am one that needs therapy, and that he read about the signs of a narcissist and that I have them. He even admitted joining a Reddit thread about narcissistic partners/spouses and when I asked what my signs were the only thing he's ever told me is that I get quite when we argue and I stop talking or I just refuse to interact. I've told him that is I coping mechanism I developed from the relationship with my physical/mentally abusive ex-husband because the more I tried to fight back, explain myself, stand up for myself. The worse the beatings were and he knows this. Again any insight would be helpful and thanks in advance.",,,

However all night and this morning all I want is him. I miss when he was loving and caring the few times and I want to see him and try and fix this but I know it's bad and shouldn't happen. I just don't know what to do to stop myself from going back to him. I feel like I still love him but if I go back I doubt anything will change and I can't go through all of that again. I just need help and advice to stay away from going back.,,,

It is 5:37am and I have what's left of my basic necessities (plus a few of my ""wants"") in the car with me. I say ""the rest of"" because I had moved out over 2 weeks ago after I was called a ""lazy PoS"" for the last time... my aunt and uncle offered me a place to stay for a few months and I've been staying there. I am in a parking lot now because I don't want to disturb my aunt and uncle so early, and I was staying at her house after a show just to have a place to sleep. I was on the couch, and it erupted into a fight more than once.. it escalated so quickly... so I left, except for a few occasions, for good... 

I do feel a sense of relief.. i keep to myself in my new home. I enjoy the peace and quiet. My aunt and uncle bicker, but it doesnt bother me. It's not my issue, and it's so nice to be in a place where everything isn't my fault and I'm punished for it. 

However... this is the most heartache and pain I have ever felt.. I cannot provide my dog a good home so she's keeping her. I can see her whenever, but that means going back, and that hurts in multiple areas. When i travel, i will tske my dog to my gigs, but then i have to take her back until I can get my own place... I've gone back several times to help wjere I felt responsible, and every time what started as help turned into an expectation and then the cycle started again and I would leave again and ust reopen all the wounds that can't hea - due to my inablility to cut contact completely because I feel compelled, to a fault, to do the right thing... it is a blessing and a curse..

This hurts so much.. Overall, I am okay. Not wanting to ""end it"" at all, so to speak. Haven't even thought of it. No harm has been done to myself (which used to be an issue). In this sense, I am extremely proud of how strong I have been, but there is deep, deep presence of pain and hopelessness... When I invisioned leaving, pain was never in the equation, but it seems to be a majority of what I'm feeling. I don't understand..

Why does something that is ultimately *extremely* positive for myself so painful... ",,,

I’m tired of listening to his gaslighting and him thinking I’m cheating even when I’m not. 
But I’m super scared to dump him because he’s mentally unstable and I feel like it might be smarter to wait the 6 weeks until he gets out (he’s been in for over a year already) and then dump him when he can get “over women”.

I have a pattern of falling for the wrong guy, trying to fix people, and prioritizing others over myself. Recognizing this was one thing, but breaking out of the cycle was another. A year ago, I was too broke to get therapy, so I started reading self-help books and made a list of the qualities and values my future partner must have. I took time for myself and reflected on my own unhealthy patterns. I really want children someday, but I don’t want to raise them alone.  

In September, I slowly started dating again. But this time, I thought more about who my future children would have to call their father rather than what I found exciting. In December, I met a guy I wouldn’t normally go for, someone I initially thought was boring. But he matched my list perfectly. I kept seeing him, and he turned out to be the kindest man I have ever dated. After two months, I started to develop real feelings for him.  

I promise it’s worth it. I feel so safe with him, but I am also my own person. I don’t have to carefully choose my words, we just talk.  

Please give the ""boring"" guy a chance. He feels boring because he doesn’t stress you out.",,,

I (28F) married my husband (31M) a year ago, and we’ve been together 3 years in total. We have two beautiful baby boys. The mask came off year 3 so last year October when I discovered he’d been cheating on me 💔

Ever since DDay, he’s been viciously defensive, compulsively lying and verbally emotionally abusive. He’s also pushed my sexual boundaries after the affair ended. 

I’m definitely getting my life in order to leave him, he’s not my person, he’s a monster and an ass hole who’s pretended to love me for 3 years. 
I can say there were some signs in the dating stages of our relationship that I thought weren’t big enough to cut him off for, but I can now see it was warning me to discontinue what is now resulted in an abusive marriage.

1jcduc9,Ghosted after chemical pregnancy,Aggravating_Big6638,1,2025-03-16 04:41:25+00:00,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcduc9/ghosted_after_chemical_pregnancy/,"
I (36f) have been dating my boyfriend (35m) for about a year. We live together. 
The whole month of February I’ve been feeling like I have the worst PMS, kept feeling like my period was going to start.

My boyfriend went on a two week work trip across the country. The day he left, I started my period but the cramps and bleeding were so much worse than normal. I felt suicidal. I told him I had to end things with him because I was afraid he was drinking again on his trip (he is about 7.5 months sober) and that I was going to the hospital because of my suicidal ideation. He didn’t respond to my messages.

At the emergency room, the doctor told me I had tested positive for pregnancy and was having a chemical pregnancy miscarriage. They gave me an ultrasound to make sure it wasn’t ectopic and then sent me home. I am devastated. 

I had a stillbirth with my exhusband over a decade ago and this brought up all the pain from that. I had mostly given up on being a mother because of the scarring and fluid in my fallopian tubes, so getting pregnant this was unexpected. One of my early signs of pregnancy is suicidal thoughts and mood swings; this happened during my first pregnancy as well.

I messaged him when I got home from the hospital apologizing for my hormonal mood swing/suicidal thoughts and for being paranoid that he was drinking. I asked him to please call me. He didn’t respond. I called him and he didn’t respond. I poured my heart out over texts about what happened and asked him to please call me. I called his voicemail and cried, begging him to talk to me. It has been five days and he has completely ghosted me. I understand if he needs time to process what happened, but I wish he would have communicated that to me instead of ghosting me. 

I’m not only losing the pregnancy, but losing him. Just a few weeks ago he held me in his arms and told me he wanted to start a family with me.
He gets back from his work trip on the 22nd. I was supposed to pick him up from the airport, but I guess I won’t be now. 

All his belongings are in my home, including important ones like his car, the title to the house he is renovating, his desktop computer… I wonder if he will come gather his possessions himself or continue to be a coward and send his parents.

I feel devastated. I thought he loved me and I believed all his promises for our future. I know he is ghosting me and not hurt in an accident or something because he is still active on social media. The pregnancy hormones are fading and I’m feeling more like myself. I will go all day keeping my mind off of the miscarriage then feel like I can barely breathe when a wave of grief hits me. 
It is hardest at bedtime. I have never felt this alone. 

My last message to him was: You wanna know what hurts more than losing a pregnancy? Being abandoned by the man I loved while I went through it.

This is one of the cruelest things anyone has ever done to me. There were times were I would see a mean side to him and I always worried that he was love bombing me or using me. I should have listened to my gut because he flipped his love off so quickly, I doubt he ever loved me at all. I keep wondering what I did wrong to make him abandon me when I lost his child. How can he hate me so much to be silent when I need him most? His mask has finally come off and I see that he is cold and cruel.

Honestly I could spend all day counting sometimes and other days I won’t count at all. Sometimes I forget to count, so overwhelmed by his presence in my mind. Those are the days when I can still feel his touch. A harsh bruising hold on my arm or a yank of my backpack to direct me where he wants me to be. 

Maybe one day I won’t have to count anymore. Maybe one day I’ll be able to feel love without a crushing fear looming over me. Maybe one day. But I guess for now I’ll just keep counting. ",,,

She told me they got into an argument because he liked some girls picture on instagram, and they started to argue. So he choked her out while their 2 kids were sleeping, left her unconscious in their apartment, stole her car, and left her for dead. She told me the only time he doesn’t put his hands on her is when she’s pregnant. 😕 

I actually didn’t know this was a normal thing for her then I remembered actually seeing her with a busted lip before but she blamed it on her toddler son. There was another incident when he showed up to our job, and was looking for her and she was hiding from him. Anyways, after he almost killed her on Mother’s Day I told her to leave him because he could’ve killed her, and left their kids without a mother. Honestly, I believe he was trying to kill her. He didn’t stop until she lost consciousness that sounds exactly like attempted murder to me. Eventually he won her back by I guess love bombing her, and buying her stuff to get her back. It’s literally a cycle. Im still very concerned for her well being because she’s having another baby by this abuser, and I fear he will continue to abuse her. I truly believe he only continues to get her pregnant to keep her stuck, and unable to leave. She has told me before she would struggle really bad without him. I am worried one day he will kill her, and leave their kids without a mother. I tried to give her solutions. I even told her we could go in on an apartment together because she deserves so much better. But I know trying to get her to leave will only result in me getting cut off as a friend and I do genuinely care about her. My old best friend is in a similar situation and cut me off because I tried to get her to leave her abuser. 


Anyways, just wanted to vent about the situation close to me. I hope her, and the babies are safe everyday. They don’t deserve to be without a mother, and I’m worried about what they’re exposed to with a man like this around. If that man strangles you, and hits you he will kill you. Nobody can ever convince me otherwise. ",,,

I also feel sorry for him. He is hardworking and doesn't come from a good household.. His father nearly killed him while, dunking him in water when he was about 8 months for more than 5 times (just for irritating him). I dread waking up next day in this household.

Today after I saw him flirting with random girls at the store we went to, I was feeling a bit irritated. We go to a local market for groceries and someone asked if we were married. I said that we weren’t, and they proceeded to ask if we were engaged. Sometimes since I’m shy, I get a little bit uncomfortable and don’t know how to answer, since technically we are not engaged since I was never given a ring. I guess I was a bit brash and said “mentally we are.” Which I know was kind of mean maybe, but what I meant was that we aren’t formally engaged. In front of everyone, he told me to go f*** myself. I really didn’t want to drive home with him (he has full control of my car), because I knew that he was going to drive recklessly. It was worse than I expected. I was sure we would get pulled over- scratch that I was PRAYING we would, because it was so scary. He then said, “f*** you, I will marry a b***h on the corner.” He had said things like this before, and I often feel like saying, ‘okay, if that is what you want then do that.’ 
We sharply cut down a tiny alley going 65 miles an hour. As we flew out onto a street my brand new tire blew out. Of course he blamed it on me and said it was my fault and this is what happens when you are disrespectful. I didn’t say anything, I’m surprised we didn’t get killed, so maybe I should thank my lucky stars that was all that happened. 
How should I approach this? I know what I said was a bit rude, but what he said was honestly worse imo.",,,
1jc7x08,Not sure if I should press charges,Old_Flatworm3,4,2025-03-15 23:19:38+00:00,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jc7x08/not_sure_if_i_should_press_charges/,"||basically he was face/throat fucking me really hard and at certain points i kept saying ""no"" ""i dont want to"" and ""Stop"" and he kept going. At one point I started to cry and he tried to keep going but it took me actually crying a bit for him to stop. He also would just force it in and used his hand to open my mouth. I tried having a discussion with him about it today and he says it was ""CNC"" but there was no discussion about it beforehand (we've talked about ""no limits"" days but that was months ago, we had no agreement to do it last night), no discussion of safewords, and he didnt do aftercare. I have a lot of evidence against him including him saying ""you kept going"" after i told him it wasnt consensual when I was saying no/stop/i dont want to, and then I said because he was forcing it and he said ""thats what facefucking is"". I also have the condom and havent showered yet so I could get a rape kit done, but I feel conflicted about it. He also made me puke on it when I said I didn't want to. This isn't the first time he has done this with me/crossed my boundaries/not respected the word ""no"". But last night was bad. 

I'm just conflicted about whether I am overreacting or not and should press charges. He is my FWB and we aren't exclusive. He treats me like shit. But I don't want to hurt him how he hurt me? Part of me still likes him and wants to see him again? It's so confusing. But I'm hurt and dissociated and sad after last night. After I told him I didn't feel good about last night and it wasn't consensual he said I should come over to his tonight so he can use all my holes. 

Any advice appreciated. ",,,

1jc7joy,I hate both of my parents,Double-Ear-6920,1,2025-03-15 23:01:31+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jc7joy/i_hate_both_of_my_parents/,"When I was younger <12 my dad worked full time and my mom did nothing. She constantly stressed me saying ""your dad is going to cheat one me"" like ALL the time. ""You promise you will let me have full custody? Tell them that in court! Imagine some other woman trying to raise you as their son!"" My dad was never able to go to beach on holidays when we went, even with his own side of the family... bc ""he will look at naked girls"" aka girls in swimsuits, bc... it's THE FUCKING BEACH). 

My dad's parents were my saving grace, every weekend and most weeks I didn't have school I stayed with them (just 15 min away) and I didn't have to hear arguing and throwing stuff all the time. Well when I was 10/11 they bought me a small four wheeler (and helmet!) And my mom FLIPPED THE FUCK OUT, would no longer let me go over there and cussed them out. She would leave voicemails to them saying they are evil people. She would always tell me it's just me and her and that my dad would eventually leave. The stress was so bad I had a few Grey hair by 12 years old, at one point for a year or two thought I had chrons disease bc her cousin has it and my stomach was ALWAYS torn up. First day of kindegarden I shit myself and cried for my mommy. She even wiped me until I was like 7/8/9.

When I was in 4th grade I wrote a note to this girl's friend that I liked her friend and told her she was ""hot"". After a response it ended back up in my bag and my mom found it. She raised hell told me I'm a nasty slut for liking girls so young, (I was  a 10/11 year old boy) and that I was not allowed to look at, talk to , or especially not date ANYONE until I was 16, preferably 17. 

I wasn't allowed to have social media but downloaded it and hid it at night lol.  She never would go out with me and my dad but maybe once a year, bc she had to put on 4/5 hours worth of makeup (expensive) makeup. (She paid bills with my dad's money and we almost lost the house bc she was using the money on her make up, even tho she didn't go anywhere except the store and doctor to get her oxycontin (since I was 5 her hysterectomy ""went wrong"" and she needed 100smg of oxy a day plus zoloft and lorazepam)

She would take them all and go doctor hopping so my dad would put them in his car to take to work so she would only have what she needed that day. Well even at 11/12 I was ""too young"" to stay home by myself! So she would take me with her to break into his car (smash window/etc) to get it. Shit triggered a panic disorder in me.

This was around 13, she started going out with her extended family more. Turns out, she started cheating with her cousin, and left my dad. Never even had a custody thing bc she had no money for a lawyer and I didn't want to stay with a cheating, jobless, psychotic whore anyway. 

My dad finally started giving me freedom I never had, he would go out on weekend my my grandma would watch me or I'd be home alone. Around this time I got into weed. The bullying at school was easier when I had a good smoke to come home and look forward to.

Well by the time I'm 14 he starts dating this ugly,  2 pack a day cigarette christian-fascist woman with 2 kids. Within 6 months she burned her house down and moved in with us. She started setting new rules my dad didn't have, like I can't close my door with my gf in there (my dad didn't care as long as I used protection) but he said I needed to listen to her. She said I would burn in hell forever if I had sex before marriage. I also walked into MY OWN HOUSE to her and my dad fucking as loud as possible in MY room with door open, they had been dating less than a year and weren't married.

At this point (15) I spent summer with my grandparents who let me and my gf close the door lol. Same way they used to do for my dad. ""Yall gonna do it regardless we just want ya to be safe""  around school time they bought a new house 5min away from my grandparents and wanted me there so ""we can be a family"" I said no take it to court (I was 16 now). And never turned back.

I developed BPD which led to opiate addiction, the girl I dated at 15 that my stepmom told me I couldn't have sex with lasted until 21, we had a house together at 17. It failed bc I had serious trust issues and even tried therapy at 16, but my grandma, bless her heart (she doesn't force religion on me) got me a Christian ""psychiatrist"" (religious idiots should not be allowed in medicine) that I just agreed with everything he said and he said ""he seems perfectly fine with me!"" And I never went back or got help. Eventually got into Gma pain pills and when kratom saved me from that at 17/18, my gf and I lived at my grandpa's old house below them.

After a few years down there, one of my best friends from kindergarten all thru high-school hangout for first time in years bc people said I was weird for only hanging out with my girlfriend (she was my bff 100%) so we hangout and decides to do some coke like we did in high-school. I did it and he said ""there's some heroin in it to ;) I ended up addict3d, destroyed my life, my gf got hooked, we broke up, I went to methadone clinic to get help and try to get right so we could get back together and methadone clinic gave me 200mg but you have to take it THERE, they don't give you take homes here. So I blacked out bc they gave me twice what I needed. 

Well, I killed someone and got 25 years in prison, suspended thankfully due to the fact IT WASNT MY FAULT I TRUSTED THE DOCTOR. And now here I am back at grandparents, who are Grey now and GPA prob has alzheimers:( with no friends, no girlfriend/bestfriend or even dates. My ex is getting married now.. I'm finally sober but I can't get her back, our old house sold and demolished to pay for legal fees. I think my time on earth  is almost over guys. I don't have a plan yet but it's coming :(",,,

He said I was awful and had never stooped so low to choose food and alone time over ""discussing"" our relationship. I should say, he was okay with me getting food but just wanted to carry on the argument. 

Similarly, he has been mad before when we were arguing for hours until 2am, and I was so tired I begged him to let me sleep. He said I was choosing sleep over the relationship and said similar things about how awful I am then. He brings it up to this day, that I chose sleep over our relationship.

That dark evil look that he has where I don’t know what’s going on behind those eyes. I had a feeling the first night I was going to have sex whether I liked it or not. The look, that dark look told me I was right. I’m a bit older now, my body - especially my vagina, can’t handle the rough angry pawing of an abusive drunk man. I didn’t want sex. I went to sleep and woke up with it already in progress, his hands and mouth on me and in me. I disassociate and freeze when this happens. This is not consent. This was not love. This was him abusing me. The roughness, of course, caused some bleeding. I didn’t want to see it in my panties when I used the restroom, it’s traumatizing, so I had put a tampon in. I was shutting things out and shutting myself down. Disassociating. Feeling out of it. This happens a lot. One time 2 yrs ago it happened 3x in a week, not sure if 1 out of the 3 was anal, but I do remember he whispered something nasty in my ear as he got off of me that night. This time I did something I don’t normally do. I had wiped the bleeding away with a tissue. I threw it in the trash. The next morning, I picked it out of the trash and put it in a plastic bag. To remind myself? To say to myself, look - blood! Blood does not equal love! That night I put on a skims style body suit thing that goes to mid thigh, no holes or anything for my butt, you have to pull the whole thing down to use the restroom. On top of that, I put a sweater with very difficult to open buttons. The buttons are pearls and diamonds that snag and are cute but non functioning buttons, essentially. That’s what I went to sleep in. I have opened the buttons on that sweater like twice since I’ve gotten it, bc they are difficult and it’s easier to throw over my head to put it on. That night I woke up because I was cold. I was naked. There was wetness. My knee was in a wet spot on the bed and my butt was wet and there were things being dripped onto my black side. My face was in the bed, and my butt was in the air. My knees were bent slightly spread. There was something in my asshole. I don’t know if it was his dick or fingers as I was in the process of waking up. I said no! Stop! And he grabbed me by the hips and pulled me back to him. I think the reason he went in my butt was because I had the tampon in. The tampon was in not bc of period, but due to his actions the night before which caused the bleeding in my vagina. So one night I get it vaginally, the next night I get it in the ass. I missed an event with the kids bc I got agitated and stressed and then I realized it was because I had lube coming out of my asshole. The first three images are what I wrote before he raped me vaginally. The second was after the anal rape the next night. He’s not having sex unbeknownst to himself in his sleep. His actions are deliberate. He knew and knows what he’s doing. I can look back and see that when this has happened before, that I was doing things for myself or better handling things emotionally. I thought I could suppress this one too. Only I couldn’t. The thought of giving his number to my surgeon’s office as someone to call in case of an emergency? I stuttered and started shaking. He had also told me it would make him happy if I died on the table during surgery. When I looked shocked and got up to leave he, of course as always, said it was a joke. It was just a joke. All the mean things he says to me, that’s just a joke or no he doesn’t remember saying that or flat out no he didn’t or he tries to change what he’s said. I’m in the process of trying to move out but y’all, there’s still that part of me that says the kids, it’s easier with kids to have two parents in the house. I work (according to him don’t contribute or do enough). I volunteer. I am shattered and can’t understand why it’s so hard to love me. I am broken and feel like emotionally I’m a burden to those around me and toxic. I live in a small-ish town, but I’ve developed some friendships here and a small network here that I would have died without having. My health has suffered so much from this, to having a thyroid disease to a heart issue to debilitating allergies (celiac/dairy/nuts/etc). I don’t know what to do. My gp and psych say to make a police report and pursue criminal charges, but isn’t that for law & order svu? Ironically, it’s one of my favorite shows. He hates it and will not watch it/ allow me to because he says his ex wife used to watch it. Part of me wants to reach out and talk to her to see why they really got divorced. Did she experience this? I also found he has the Grindr app from august 2018 until it disappeared from my view (not necessarily ended, app could be hidden) May 2024. I don’t have money to afford the lifestyle, for that matter neither does he. I have two little ones here, and they are amazing and wonderful spirits that I can not believe I am blessed to be their mom. They are my little superstar heroes, they are so accomplished and do so many things and activities from sports to art to dance. I can’t let them down. I will not fail them. But I have, because I can’t give them all of me and who I am, all the good if me because my shine is so hidden by the walls I built to keep my heart beating and my lungs breathing. I tried to suppress it all and I crashed on my bike. Numb to the pain. I couldn’t cry. I couldn’t have an orgasm while masturbating. I used to be able to handle this and disassociate. I can not anymore. I feel like I’m running down a hill but I can’t control the direction. I’ve been cleaning, that’s good. But I am so afraid I’m going to back slide and agree to stay with him. He’s the one who has screamed divorce at me hundreds of times. Now that I’ve agreed (in November), he now doesn’t want to get divorced. I told him we are, I’m looking for a place yet he keeps sending me info on houses like it’s all normal, and that since he’s moved on from “the argument” I should just forgive him and move on too because why can’t I just forgive him. Don’t think there was one conversation about it, he doesn’t want to talk about it just wants me to “forgive him and love him”. I need direction and strength, it’s hard to trust my thoughts because that’s how he’s made me be. My definition of love unto me is love=pain. I need strength to get through all of this. I need a lawyer and I don’t have money for one. I am lost but still need to lead, the kids and my coworkers. I am aware that I’ll be pegged as the Xitch and bad guy in the divorce. I wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for letting me vent. No one knows the whole story of my marriage, it’s humiliating. Embarrassing. Traumatizing. Violating. Terrorizing. It’s so awful, silently I hate to see those happy people showing support and kind love to each other because I don’t know how that feels nor have I experienced that in a long time. I have a glimpse and a glimmer of hope now, but I don’t know what to trust anymore. He’s out of town until April, and I dread the return intensely. I have a quiet thought on repeat, when I’m making dinner or cleaning or breathing. It’s help me help me help me help me help me. I need to help myself but I’m so soul worn and broke tired of it all.

1jbxy01,I Think I Might be in Danger,ChewsFoodOnlyTwice,2,2025-03-15 15:43:54+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbxy01/i_think_i_might_be_in_danger/,"TW: Self harm 

Today is the first day in my life that I thought I was in serious danger by a romantic partner and I'm not exactly sure what to do. My partner has never physically abused me but I think he is trying to convince everyone around me that I'm suffering from severe postpartum depression, a danger to myself and our 6 month old. 

I'm not. I have struggled with suicidal ideation my whole life but since giving birth it has been non-existent. I suspect because I have a much stronger sense of self preservation now because my baby needs me. I have talked about this extensively with my therapist and mentioned it several times to my husband. 

We're going through a divorce. A contested divorce because he won't agree to a divorce. Last week he reported me to CPS for a whole bunch of stuff that were either straight up lies or not abuse at all (he told them that I keep threatening to get a divorce.. my divorce lawyer accompanied me and we all just kind of paused for a second..) one of the things he said was that I was suicidal. I told them that was absolutely not true. I have a whole team of medical professionals that I meet with regularly to make sure my medication is working and that I have emotional guidance. I have a therapist I meet with once a week. I have support groups. I released my therapy notes to them to prove that since I have given birth I have not expressed that I am a danger to myself or others. 

After the meeting, hearing the things he accused me of, and having explained what was actually happening (he is intimidating me into thinking that if I go through with the divorce I won't get custody) I was afraid of him in a whole new way. The accusations were wild. The idea that he would accuse me of abusing our child or worse for divorcing him (he reported me the same day I told him I was going through with the contested divorce) was terrifying. Those types of actions have real life repercussions. 

I went home to visit my family (my step dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer this week) and while I was talking about the DCS meeting my family members started telling me that he has been trying to convince them that I am suicidal and homicidal for months. He called my mom and told her he ""knows the signs"" (he doesn't.. he knows nothing about my mental health conditions because he doesn't like talking about it and he screams at me every time I try to talk about it) h told her that I'm in a dangerous place. She was obviously like ""No I know my daughter better than you and I know what she's experiencing right now and it's not that"" and he argued with her! Yelling at her to not ""downplay this"" because it's ""serious""! She ignored him and just shut the conversation down. Last weekend I left a family event crying because I was given the cold shoulder (gee I wonder why.. know now that he's been saying outlandish things about me) and he called my brother and my mom and gave them weird cryptic messages that hinted at the fact that I was in immediate danger. My brother showed up at my house before I got there. My mom called me frantic. It was ridiculous and I told them it was ridiculous. I was just normal person sad about a normal person sad event and I wanted to go home instead of being in a place I didn't feel welcome. 

I remembered this morning that he occasionally tries to tell me I have said some very very strange things in the past that I KNOW I haven't because I have never even had the thought or feeling related to them. He sold his car a few years ago to buy something and now he's trying to convince everyone I made him sell his car so that he ""couldn't leave me"". Which is absolutely ridiculous. I do not want to force someone to be with me and I'M THE ONE WHO IS TRYING TO LEAVE. 

I have been thinking about all this stuff for days because it doesn't make any sense to me. He doesn't want a divorce but says all these wild things about me. He doesn't work and that's part of why we're getting a divorce. He says I can't make him work and I say he can't force me to financially support him and I will divorce him if that is what it takes. So why would he be doing all this stuff? He needs me to keep a roof over his head. 


It occurred to me that when I was once hospitalized for suicidal thoughts (before I had the baby) they called him to ask him if he was comfortable with me going home. At the time, we joked about it because that's a potentially dangerous situation to put a woman in. I told him how once when I was hospitalized I met a woman who was running away from her abusive husband and he called the police and told them she had snapped and was a danger to herself. She was in there for over a month. She had to go to court and get a judge to order her removal. He did. 

It occurred to me today that it's possible he is trying to get me into a hospital for ""postpartum depression"". It would get me out of the house (that I own) and paychecks would keep coming in (from my job!) because I would be out on medical leave and he could idk. Use that to prove I'm an unfit mother in court? I don't even know what the end goal is. I don't know what's going on. But I'm afraid to go back home. ",,,

Just said he was going out. I did some things around the house then called (he didn't answer) and texted him to check in, asked if he'll be out for much longer. He didn't reply for about a half hour so I decided to go to a bar I like to have a drink, get out of the house. When I told him I was going out, he immediately jumps to accusing me of going to meet guys, saying ""Enjoy whoever you end up with wherever you're going,"" ""Enjoy whoever you meet wherever you're going,"" ""I'm sure you'll get the attention you're looking for,"" ""You'll pick up some [instagram] followers in the coming days I'm sure."" When I said he was being demeaning, he said ""You're being delusional."" For the couple hrs I was at the bar, I sat in the corner by myself,  writing in my journal and texting with him, trying to hold back tears. I was going to get a second drink, but didn't want to end up getting more emotional, so I went home. He texts me at 12:30 saying he'll be back soon. I went to sleep around 2:30 and he still wasn't back.
I cant stand to even look at him right now. He's going to justify every fucking thing he said and make it all my fault. Again. ",,,

1jbweba,I think I might have escaped an abusive relationship,Outrageous_Contest91,8,2025-03-15 14:32:47+00:00,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbweba/i_think_i_might_have_escaped_an_abusive/,"Hello,

I am sorry if this is a useless post or insulting to survivors on this thread but I have been thinking back on my relationship that I just escaped.

I (23f) and him (22m) meet in college and it goes really well for the first two months. We were together for a total of five months. I had never been in a relationship before him and had no frame of reference for proper relationships. He was very kind and loving for the first couple months. 

He went out of his way to see me or do nice things but I always had a feeling that something wasn’t right. Not in an obvious ways but I would feel anxious at the thought of being in my apartment alone with him at the start or I felt I couldn’t dress fully comfortable around him. Then he would get drunk and he would say mean and degrading things to me and I did try to break up with him when he first said that but he said everything I wanted to hear and did everything a girl could want. 

A week later we celebrate his birthday, mine was two days after. 
He had forgotten and we had an argument, he apologised and asked for another chance I said yes because I wanted to believe that this man did actually care about me.

Eventually, he starts ignoring me when I felt depressed and anxious, he started comparing me with a woman who he swore he didn’t like that much, he would do this after being intimate with each other. 
I asked to break up and he agrees and I take the opportunity to just tell him everything because I was never going to speak to him again after the phone went down, I hated the way he made me feel. 

I was crying on the phone and I knew we’re done but I begged to do the bare minimum and he said he couldn’t do it. He asked me to stay on the phone while I was crying and he started saying that I am enough and I was a good girlfriend. 

Once I said I know I’m good enough and this hasn’t affected my self esteem he got nasty and couldn’t wait to hang up the phone. I gave him back his stuff including a necklace he gave me the first time we were intimate and he took said it was an awful necklace and he was going to throw it in the trash. I stood up, took my stuff and said goodbye with my head held high.

This was obviously not fantastic but then I thought back on how he would make comments about how I eat, how I’m heavy or how I’m too muscular. I lost 20lbs being with him because I couldn’t eat near him and when I was away I felt nauseous. He would be nice a lot of the time but he had a snide remark whenever he knew I was going to be away from him. His favourite photo of me was when he made me cry for two hours straight and then I had to get dolled up for dinner. 

There is more stuff about our times being intimate and how he wasn’t always the nicest but it was consensual, just not fun or romantic.

I apologise if I am being dramatic and I most likely wasn’t in an abusive relationship but so many people in my life would ask questions about my relationship that teeter on asking whether he ever hurt me. 

Edit: Thank you all for responding so quickly and so kindly. I haven’t really spoken in detail about the breakup as it only happened two days ago and I was afraid that I would come across like a scorned ex. I knew something was wrong when I visited my friend yesterday. They live about 20 minutes from his home, I started to dry heave and panic even though I knew he was in work because I was so afraid of him just seeing me.",,,

1jbtazk,I discovered more..,Lavendarr2826,3,2025-03-15 11:44:39+00:00,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbtazk/i_discovered_more/,"I just need to talk. Keeping everything to myself is exhausting. I can’t talk to him about it—he always becomes hostile, aggressive, and somehow turns it all back on me. It’s like clockwork. And with the kids here, I don’t want them to see him like that.

The other day, I calmly asked if he told his parents something personal about me. I always approach these things with an open mind, trying to be fair. Most of the time, I already know the answer—I just want to give him the chance to be honest. I need him to be honest. There was a time I literally begged on my knees, sobbing on the couch while he walked past me without a shred of remorse. I even wrote him the most heartfelt letter, hoping to get through to him. Total failure. His response? Dismissive, rude, full of denial. I couldn’t even finish reading the letter he wrote back.

Anyway, back to the other day. I asked him, and as expected, he lied. I put my feelings aside and reassured him that it wasn’t a big deal—I just wanted to know what they knew, since I’d be seeing them soon. But he kept lying. And then, like always, he got angry. His favorite line: “I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m not lying. You need to accept that.” I even tried to minimize it so he wouldn’t feel so defensive, but it was useless. Eventually, I let it go. He’s exhausting. Maybe that’s what he wants—me, weak.

Later, at the hospital visiting my dad, I don’t remember exactly how it came up again. Maybe he asked why I was upset, and I probably just said something like, “I give up. I just wish you’d be honest with me.” As we walked to the elevators, his tone shifted, that familiar edge creeping in. I told him to calm down. In the elevator, I finally just repeated back a snippet of the exact conversation he had with his mom. He stopped mid-sentence.

Then, just the other day, I asked about his sobriety. He’s a porn addict—a sex addict, really. That’s a whole other story about how I got caught up with him in the first place. He’s never actually been sober. I told him I knew he wasn’t doing well. I didn’t even bring up everything else, just the porn. He still lied. He got aggressive, started yelling, slammed the car door on me, then drove off.

Later, he admitted he got “heated” because he doesn’t like feeling backed into a corner. Finally, he admitted he hadn’t been doing well. But by the end of the day, the same cycle repeated—denial, defensiveness. “I’ve done nothing wrong.” He’s never done anything wrong, according to him. It’s all nonsense, apparently.

The frustrating part? I see his patterns. I recognize the abuse. He knows I do—that’s why he shuts down and repeats his rehearsed lines instead of addressing anything.

I don’t even know why I put myself through this cycle. I know he won’t tell me the truth. He’s even gone as far as accusing me of planting evidence when I confront him. And yet, there’s this part of me that still hopes—hopes he’ll show me that he loves me, that he cares. It’s pathetic, really.

It’s heartbreaking to know so much and have to keep it in, because if I don’t, he’ll emotionally abuse me. He’s called me crazy.

Someone who claims to love you shouldn’t make you question your own reality just so they can continue lying. I say “attempt” because I know too much for him to gaslight me fully—but it’s still so, so wrong. How can someone do this to another human being, let alone their partner?

The worst part? The mindfuck of it all. Because he can be loving, sweet. We have fun together. But I understand now—it’s not enough. And it never will be.

And the projection? That’s the kicker. Anything I call him out on—his emotional abuse, gaslighting, manipulation—he throws it all back at me in the next argument, word for word, but in the wrong context. It’s exhausting.

And now, I’ve discovered more. I know who two of the other women are. Oh right, yesterday when he came out of the shower, he had scratches on his neck and shoulders. I’ll post photos. I don’t know, maybe he loves her. 

I wish he loved me. But I strongly believe the cheating excites him. It’s all he ever reads about. 

How could I be so stupid? How do I still love this man? I love him so deeply, and it hurts that I’m not enough. Why are you with me? Why are you doing this to me? How can you say you love someone while being the one to put the knife in their back? You are fucking killing me. How can you not feel any remorse? I’m literally shaking in tears. I don’t even know who he is, but I wish he would prove that he cared. God this hurts so much. 

We had a daughter together, and I gave her the worst man to look up to. I just hope with all my heart she never ends up with someone like him.

If anyone wants to read our messages or the letter I wrote him, I’ll share.


I’ll have to make a new post to show photos as I can’t add them with the edit ",,,
1jbrqz8,Attorney Recommendations in Georgia,chelsbellsatl,2,2025-03-15 09:56:10+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbrqz8/attorney_recommendations_in_georgia/,"I'm currently separated from my abusive spouse. Before we split, he was incredibly emotionally, financially, and verbally abusive. He controlled all of our finances and frequently threatened to cut me off and/or sell everything and disappear. After a series of incidents that eventually escalated and became public, we split in July and have been living separately since. 

Before we split, he had me sign and notarize a separation agreement in which we divided assets (he controlled all finances, and did the analysis of our wealth) and he agreed to pay $1000/mo in alimony for 4 years. The intent was to file pro se, and wrap things up quickly, both to protect his reputation and our mutual financial well being. 

As you might expect, the abusive partner never filed. Now, he doesn't want to pay alimony and is doing everything in his power to lose his job and drain his assets before we get the divorce going. I've filed for a TPO to stop him from draining assets (and harassing me, an ongoing issue) but it hasn't been served to him yet as he's hiding at his new girlfriend's house and I don't have the address. 

I'm able to survive off of what we divided already, but will need the alimony to obtain health insurance as it isn't offered through my position. I make like 1/10th of what my spouse does, and have no assets to fall back on. (He owns a 400k+ house, a Tesla M3, etc) 

I am desperately seeking an affordable divorce attorney in DeKalb County, Georgia who can help me with this case. I need representation both for the divorce and the TPO. I'm also considering a defamation suit, which would need to be filed soon to stay within the one year SOL. Any recommendations?",,,

I tried one tonight and it was so positive that I immediately thought it would be good for so many victims.

The only issue I can see is that it transcribes the abuse and then it links to ChatGPT to give an analysis. In my case that was so very positive. You constantly worry that you are overreacting or did something wrong so it was nice to see ChatGPT say positive things when it was a ""neutral"" party.

The problem I can potentially see is that it might be negative to an abused person without proper context or that it may end up being too ""understanding"" of an abuser. In general AI can sometimes present a person in the best light and I am afraid it might do it for someones abuser. In my case it was overall fairly negative to my abuser but I could see that not being the case for every recording. I'm going to include a small section that only reveals general information about my situation:

""Later, after the storm calms and the mother exits the conversation, the father steps in as a source of comfort. He reassures his children that they are loved, regardless of the tensions between the adults in their lives. His presence becomes a soft landing for their confusion and sadness.

# What This Teaches Us About Family Dynamics

1. **Pain and Compassion Often Coexist** Parents can be hurting, and in their pain, they may say things they don’t mean. They may lash out or fail to see the struggles of their partners. But families that hold space for compassion—especially when voiced by children—can offer opportunities for healing.
2. **Children Are Active Participants in Family Narratives** Children notice more than we think. They interpret, advocate, and try to make sense of the dynamics around them. Their perspectives can offer clarity and sometimes a deeper wisdom, as the child demonstrates in this exchange.
3. **Emotional Safety is Essential** Even amid conflict, it’s possible to create moments of safety and reassurance. The father’s tender words and actions toward his children are a testament to the role of emotional security in navigating family challenges.
4. **Words Matter** Language shapes the emotional landscape of a home. Harsh words leave lasting impressions, especially on young minds. But kind, affirming language can be just as powerful in healing wounds and reinforcing bonds.",,,

In January my husband repeatedly raped me over the course of a month. I have had a very hard time dealing with this, having panic attacks almost daily and dissociating so much I have been losing time. He has since been acting like nothing happened. I ended up leaving for 9 days because my anxiety was so bad I felt I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. 

I ended up going back 3 days ago after he called, acknowledged what he did and said he wants to work on the marriage. I also felt very guilty about his emotional state. When I came back we had a long discussion, in which I asked him why he would do something that he knew he could go back to prison for if I reported him. He told me if I called the police he would just kill himself. 

I told him that I am afraid of him, and that I am 99 percent sure he would never kill me, but there is still 1 percent. I asked if he knew what it felt like to not be 100 percent sure your partner would kill you. He said ""actually, yes. I've always been afraid might try to kill me if I left you"". I immediately broke down in tears because I could never hurt him, and have given him no reason to think I would. He also told me he has been paranoid for months I might use one of his combat knives to kill him in his sleep. This seemed like a really bizarre thing to say, because, again, I am not a violent person at all.  Now I am wondering if maybe he is setting up some kind of defense? It was such a violent image, and he does have a combat knife in our bedroom. Am I right to be concerned about this? ",,,

I've been hesitant to post here because I'm not sure that my situation is nearly the same as the horrible things that other people here go through. I couldn't find another subreddit that seemed to fit what I want to talk about and I don't really have anyone I trust to speak to about this with. 

My partner and I have only started being intimate recently, but I've encountered a problem with it; They wont stop hurting me. They like to bite me, really hard. it leaves bruises on me, especially in my throat area. It makes it hard to swallow and move around properly and I don't like the way it looks. I've told them i dont want them to do it but they do anyways. after i flinched away really badly one time they suggested that we do a test where they bite me harder and harder until i cant take it so that they can know how hard to bite. I said no i really don't want to do that but they kept asking and i said no. I was really scared of them for the first time ever im not really sure why. but they are bigger than me and were on top of me and then they kind of did it anyway. they didn't outright say it but they bit me a few more times harder and harder until i flinched again then they didn't go harder. they also did it on other parts of me that are swollen and sore now. my flinching seems to just encourage them to keep going

why are they so insistent on biting me to this point? i don't know a lot about sex or like less vanilla stuff. is it normal for biting to reach this point? I could probably learn to get over it but it ended up really bad and it was like i wasn't even in my own body anymore. sometimes i enjoy being intimate when it doesn't hurt but 98% of the time im just thinking about anything else or thinking about when it will be over. am i just inexperienced in this sort of thing?

A day after that, I found out he unblocked me. If he hates me as much as he says he does, if he plays the victim so hard, why did he unblock me?

!!!I am safely out of this relationship.!!!


I dated a bloke who had autism. However for four years he insisted that I had borderline personality disorder. Is this normal for an autistic person to blame someone for having borderline personality disorder when relationships take work?. 

Even when we argued (as most people do in relationships as they are not perfect!!) he’d accuse me of having borderline personality disorder because I was assertive and confident. I stood my ground and called him out when he was unfair. I too have flaws but I don’t angrily say my partner has borderline personality disorder when things don’t go well. 

He is just a past relationship with no verified credentials to dish out the complex nature of borderline personality disorder or personality disorders for that matter. 

How do I overcome this toxic relationship. Yes it’s over. 

I’m in therapy but I just need some support and additional support. 

How did you handle your boyfriend or girlfriend constantly attacking your character and saying that you had borderline personality disorder.?",,,

But then flip sides and say things like “I’ve done a lot of changing and growing and you’ve done nothing- I’m a great person I don’t deserve shitty people in my life- I’m going to do big things with or without you- etc.”

I’m sure this comes down to them actually just being insecure and not liking themselves. I have a hard time trying to console them when they’re self loathing, and obviously don’t like being talked down to when they’re acting better than me.

I have an appointment this Tuesday, I told all of them that it was an appointment for my son for us to continue to get WIC. My dad overheard me speaking to my potential case manager, confirming for Tuesday. He asked me about it, and I told him that I had to go in just for the appointment because if I don’t that they would take the food stamps away. He said, “it doesn’t matter, I will take care of you and the baby.” Yet, he has stopped financially supporting me after he got physically abusive with me back in January. I told him that I think it’s best that I could go, because they could also take our health insurance. He told me that if I go for the appointment, and they give me a voucher, and I accepted, That my son will be taken from me. And I’m completely appalled. He goes on to say, “who’s gonna help you with the baby? I don’t know if you’re ready to be on your own. I don’t think you can do this.” I’m with my son All day, every day. Since the day I gave birth to him. Motherhood is not easy but I have never hurt my son or thought about hurting him.

My experiences are a lot more difficult, but my headspace is a lot better. And it stresses me out when they tell me that my son will be taken from me. And I’m trying to tell myself, that it’s not true. Why would they take my son? What grounds do they have to take him? None! My son is healthy, he is safe, and he’s more than OK! So I don’t know why they keep on trying to give me anxiety behind being independent, But then want me to have it all figured out!

They try to scare you back into your box, so they know that you’re able to be controlled than that box.

We met when I was 19 and he was 21, and we've been together for eight years. We pretty much built our adult lives together and grew up alongside each other.

When we first met, he didn’t want to be in a relationship, but I stuck around because I really liked him—and, honestly, because I had messed-up self-esteem *lol.* Things weren’t all bad, but he often insulted me, calling me names during arguments—words like *""stupid,""* *""retarded,""* *""a bitch,""* etc. As I’ve said, I never had high self-esteem, so I believed him. I internalized the idea that *I’m not that smart or bright,* and over the years, it really undermined my confidence. Even now, I still doubt my own intelligence.

I used to cry a lot and let him know that what he was doing was hurting me. He would apologize, but the behavior always repeated.

Then, about 3.5 to 4 years into our relationship, I went to therapy for completely unrelated reasons. I had developed pretty bad anxiety and had also lost all sexual desire, so I decided to seek help. My therapist never told me I was being abused or even suggested it, but she did tell me to establish boundaries—and I did. One day, I kind of blew up and told him, *""I don't even know if I love you anymore. I can't stand living like this.""* It was a huge shock for him. He promised he would work on himself and change.

I was happy to hear that, but, honestly, I had already built up a lot of resentment and couldn't let go of the past. So, even after about six months of my boyfriend (now husband) being nice to me, my sexual desire didn’t return, and eventually, he stopped trying. I understood his frustration and the pain of feeling emotionally rejected, but I couldn’t force my desire to come back.

We ended up getting married for legal reasons, but at the time, it felt like the natural next step because our relationship **wasn’t that bad** back then. However, after getting married, my anxiety skyrocketed. I also started struggling with eating in public (don’t even ask, it’s horrible). That’s how a few years passed—**a dead bedroom, a lack of emotional** and physical **connection, and mostly arguments**—where, at least from my perspective, he disrespected me (he says I disrespected him).

Fast forward to now: It’s been a year since I quit a job I hated to focus on my own projects, while he has been financially providing for us. I appreciate him for that, and I do take care of our apartment and our dog—but I don’t cook because I hate it (though according to him, that’s not even the biggest issue). Unfortunately, after a year of working on multiple projects, none of them have been successful yet. I’m not sure if they ever will be, but I’m not losing hope.

Recently, we've been having **lots** of arguments because:

1. **He resents me** for not contributing my “fair share” to the relationship.
2. **I resent him** for constantly putting me down and emotionally neglecting me.

# Some Things He Has Said to Me:

* During an argument about budgeting, I pushed back, and he said: **""You better start with, 'Okay, let’s see if we can make it work,' not all that other bullshit you give me. Anything having to do with money—as far as I’m concerned—you have way less say than I do.""**
* **""You’ve gotten way more out of this relationship than I have, just because I work and you don’t.""**
* **""Nobody has a better setup than you. Nobody lives a life as nice as yours.""**

I offered therapy because I honestly don’t believe we can fix this without professional help. He said he **doesn’t need therapy and doesn’t want it.** After I brought it up again and he said no, I told him that he was shutting me down. His reply:

* **""What’s wrong with you? What’s your problem? Get your shit together. Get your fucking shit together. You’re such a fucking weirdo. Just stop being such an odd person. Just hear yourself. Don’t you understand that this isn’t even likable?""**
* **""Your videos (I have a YouTube channel) probably aren’t working because you’re so cringe. You can’t even do the videos with me in the house—you’re probably so cringe.""** (When I told him this was disrespectful, he said it was *honest*.)
* **""Just look at yourself, just look at yourself. Who the hell would want you? Honestly, the only reason I stay with you is because I’ve known you for so long. I’ve loved you, you know, but like, in your state, as of right now—somebody brand new? No sex, not getting anything done, not cooking, not caring?""**",,,

I’m looking for someone to tell me I did the right thing (I left during love bombing so really just as devaluation started but because of that, things hadn’t gotten really bad yet which makes it harder…)

These are the issues I noted:

- aggressively love bombed me told me he loved me the first week we met (and made soulmate declarations) and was literally talking about marriage and moving in within days of us meeting. 
- he hid it at first but I realized that he is a major alcoholic. Drinks often right when he wakes up. His version of cutting him back on drinking was to have 3-4 drinks a day. 
- I noticed major triangulation issues involving him talking about other women being attracted to him, I assume to make me jealous or insecure. The last straw for me was being out with him when he basically ignored me and chatted with a bartender and later mentioned that he thought she was someone “he would be dating if he wasn’t dating someone else”. 
- there were numerous instances of me noticing inconsistencies in things he said over time. Probably, related to the alcohol but there might be more there. (Ex: Told me a long and detailed story about recently going to a restaurant with his ex wife to deal with some paperwork / legal docs related to his divorce and how she kept trying to kiss him and he turned down her advances. When I mentioned the restaurant later on again he said “he had never been there”) 
- all of his exes are “psychotic” and abusive to him 
- he is currently being investigated by hr for pursuing a subordinate at work (this is an attractive, younger woman who rejected him and he still stays “friends” with and really “wanted me to meet” which all seemed kind of weird to me if I’m being honest- also reeked of triangulation to me)
- physically assaulted his ex (he’s a big dude and she’s a small woman) because she was abusive to him. He has been married twice and claims both exes were abusive to him. 

There’s even more examples of weird shit that has raised my alarm bells over the past few weeks and I finally pulled the plug yesterday and have been shocked at how cold he’s been. He went from “I love you so much” and “I can’t live without you” to dropped my stuff off and not even arguing with me to stay and as much as I know this is a blessing and I needed to do this, it hurts. 

I guess I’m looking for reassurance that I did the right thing (cognitively I know I did, but emotionally is different)

We have 3 boys ages 5, 3, and 6 months. We have a house that we fully own, I’m a SAHM, and my husband makes decent money at his job. My husband is almost 32 and I am 36. 

My husband, for as long as we have been together, has had a horrible money spending and lying habit. He hides it like an addiction and always ALWAYS gets caught. We have argued about this every 3-6 months for the past 6ish years. We have a joint account that he doesn’t spend, but he has a personal account that he puts $800/month into. It ALL goes towards food, video game garbage (he plays for an hour or so after everyone goes to bed), and supplements like greens and pre workout. I’m sure there’s other crap, but from what I’ve seen, $20/day goes to takeout at work. I had tried to get him to bring lunch but he never tells me when he needs more lunch “supplies”. Over the years, he racked up over $20k in debt and his parents bailed him out of $17k of it. This is just a short, tip of the iceberg version. 

We have fought dozens of times about his spending and lying. He goes to therapy a few times after each argument and then goes right back to his habits. I finally caved and told his parents absolutely everything he does/has done. I will honestly say that I told them in hopes of him losing an ally because he was never fully honest with them. Our previous discussion about this was really good and I felt like he was going to change. Now, we are under the same roof and barely speaking. 

Do we try marriage counseling? Kids complicate this much more. I would stay together for the kids if that meant we can get past this. But I want them to know what a healthy relationship looks like and we are anything but that right now. I need to hear stories of hope and experience. He’s not a bad person, is great with the kids, and you would never guess he would have these skeletons in his closet. But I can’t live like this anymore. We were so madly in love, but every lie has stolen more and more of that from us.

1jbaujn,I hope you see this.,Complete-Horror-3420,6,2025-03-14 18:37:17+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbaujn/i_hope_you_see_this/,"I used to have another reddit account that i’ve since deleted, but i’ve made this new one as a throw away. On my old account, I made a few posts after breaking up with my abusive ex, he found it and gave advice acting as if he was another person. Shit like “oh maybe he need another chance you should forgive him” “oh maybe he need mental help, you should be there and support him” his exact words since he couldn’t speak english fluently. After blocking him on all social media and forgetting about that account for months, he messages me on there almost a year after our break up, i get the email notification and immediately delete the account without reading what he says. Because i don’t want to ever hear or read a word that comes out of his mouth. 

Anyways. I’m here to rant, because i want to move on, but i know i won’t be able to without getting all of this shit off my chest. 

I think about how he used to want to be on facetime 24/7. If i wanted to play on my computer he’d get upset, if i wanted to watch tv or draw, i couldn’t if i wanted to crochet, i couldn’t, ALL because my attention wasn’t on him. The only time he let me crochet while i was talking to him was because i was making HIM a blanket. I said i was shocked he let me crochet while we were on facetime and he said “because you’re making that for me”. If i wasn’t doing something for him or giving him attention, he got so ANGRY. 

When we would watch movies over call, he’d make me watch on my pc while I had my phone camera pointed at my face so he could make sure that i’m watching the movie. If i looked away from the screen at all he’d end the movie and start yelling at me. “What are you doing why aren’t you watching the movie” “tell me why you weren’t watching the movie” over and over and over again for hours until i gave an answer that he was satisfied with. 

A lot of times I’d give an honest answer to something he was angry about, but if it didn’t match with the reason he had in his head he’d go ballistic and would yell and argue until i just ended up agreeing with his answer instead, just to end the yelling. He was breaking down my spirit. 

Once when i got very sick, he wanted me to come over and kept persisting so i gave in. He got so angry over  that i didn’t want to have sex with him, and that’s I was sleeping too much. Once I ended up getting a UTI, and he got SO PISSED at me for “not taking care of myself or keeping myself clean” and was yelling at me for an hour before i had to send him multiple articles saying that women can get UTI’s from literally anything. 

He’d start so many fights about SUCH CHILDISH SHIT. He went through my reposts on tiktok, found a video about SHIRTLESS GOJO that i had reposted SIX MONTHS BEFORE i had even met him. He got really pissed about it and i had to sit there sobbing while he yelled at me.  Im sure so many of you know the feeling, being yelled at over and over and over, them repeating the same argument. over. and over. and over. until you’re just sitting there wanting to claw off your own skin out of anger and frustration. 
 
He also borrowed my switch lite and then ended up selling it and tried to act like he still had it. Had to fully confront him about it before he admitted it. He gave  the excuse of “oh i didn’t think you really used it, i was also going to let you use mine instead” might i point out “USE” instead of “GIVE”. If he had given me his switch or the money it wouldn’t have been so upsetting. 

Before we broke up, i had brought up the word “Verbal abuse” to him, he went crazy and started saying that he couldn’t have possibly abused me because i was the one making him sad and angry, and how he was the one taking care of me and buying stuff for me. Oh yes, the abuse just doesn’t exist because he bought a couple meals for me apparently!

When I sent him article after article, video after video of every sigh of emotional and verbal abuse, it was so obvious that even he had admitted it. We broke up, i posted to reddit seeking help, and that’s when he did what i said above. Pretended to be someone else and get me to go back to him. Even signed off his message with “sending hugs” the thought makes me want to puke. 

I really hope he sees this. I hope he sees this and a pit of sorrow and regret fills his stomach. 
If you see this, do NOT show up to my house, i WILL call the police and file a restraining order. Do NOT message me or comment on hers, I WILL OPENLY call you out. 

I’ll be posting more in the comments whenever things pop into my head. There’s A LOT more I have to say.

1jba6lp,i think my abuser truly believes he is the victim,Sea_Strength_533,27,2025-03-14 18:02:41+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jba6lp/i_think_my_abuser_truly_believes_he_is_the_victim/,"TW sexual violence

so, the idea of me “making him like this” has been a common theme in our relationship. he basically says i was mentally unstable since the beginning and i pushed him this far, and that i am actually the abusive one. this has always been confusing for me because i was mentally unstable when we got together, and i actually did hit him first, so he’s always been able to use that against me. he fails to remember that i hit him because for months of me crying for him to stop looking at other women online, he just laughed in my face and called me crazy over and over. 

anyways, i really truly do believe that he believes he is a victim, in his own fucked up brain. he sees himself as a good person, and i’m the abuser. even after berating me, calling me every name in the book, cheating on me multiple times, strangling me multiple times, threatening to rape me for months, and finally sexually assaulting me while i literally screamed and cried and begged him to stop…. he still somehow manages to play the victim. he even went so far to say that i raped him at the beginning of the relationship, 7 years ago. i do remember this instance, we had rough sex and i was the aggressor instead of him, but it always seemed consensual, and it was never brought up until literally 24 hours after he assaulted me. so somehow i was the bad guy again and i “ruined sex” for him. but he didnt start getting rapey until about 4 months ago. it’s so confusing. i left almost 6 weeks ago, and now he is discarding me. part of me is grateful because i wasnt strong enough to go no contact myself, but another part of me is heartbroken. i wish he could see the pain and trauma he has caused me. 

edit: yes, i’ve read the book. he’s definitely The Water Torturer and The Victim. intellectualizing it doesnt help how shitty and confused i feel right now though 😪",,,

We were married for almost 6 years, together for 8. Things were bad and getting progressively worse for probably the last 4 years, but in hindsight it was never really healthy. For context, some things that he did: scream in my face, break things/throw things, threaten me with blowtorch/lighters till I would cry- then get mad at me for crying, silent treatment for days, spend tons of money on stuff we couldn’t afford (alcohol obviously, guns, a boat…), refused to help at all with literally anything around the house or his own kids (not my bio kids), tied our 6 month old puppy up and beat him with a 2x4- pulled a gun and threatened to shoot him, always watching porn- talking to other women online- looking for “escorts”… and the list goes on and on of course. Way more than I care to type. All that being said, I finally got the courage and made a plan to leave. Even after all that, he almost sucked me back in. He got sober and started therapy and said he would change, so for a time we were talking again. But he was still demanding of me, not understanding of my fears, indicating to me that he wasn’t truly in recovery. I thought he should just be nothing but sorry, and shouldn’t have the gall to demand anything of me at all at that point. He was literally complaining to me about me taking my pots and pans (that were mine since before we were together btw). I realized things would never truly be good or safe, that I could never feel comfortable with him, because he couldn’t truly change who he is. So I gave up and filed for divorce. Since then I started reading the book “Why does he do that?” By Lundy Bancroft. It’s mind blowing. I see his playbook and scripts outlined. Abusers really are all the same, more or less. It’s helping me make sense of what happened to me, and understand that he did it on purpose. I feel like I am starting to heal, starting to feel like myself again. I’ve always been funny and goofy, and it’s coming back. I’m doing things for myself now, taking self defense classes, firearms classes, doing community yoga, and making new friends. All that being said… sometimes I still feel so sad. I miss him somehow. I’m grieving the dream and future I’ll never have. I realize that any love he had for me was only a lie, but I did really love him, and it still hurts. I understand intellectually that this is probably some trauma bond stuff going on, but that doesn’t make it any easier. I’m wondering… when can I expect the painful pangs to stop? How will I know when I’m ready to move on? ",,,

So I have been in trauma therapy since december and we‘re going through everything that happened right now session by session because I usually start dissociating after half an hour and panic.

Right now I feel like the person that did this to me (my ex gf) didn‘t mean it (?) and that I might be exaggerating it, and it feels like I miss her, but at the same time I can‘t look at a picture of her without panic and a strong wave of nausea. But yet, it almost feels like I need to go back because it feels familiar, almost secure (even though it‘s everything BUT secure)

It was emotional abuse which is why I am struggling a lot with ""Maybe they are right and I am crazy"" ""Maybe I am just dramatic about it"".

Need some advice right now on how to cope with that feeling of ""missing"" them and how to not fall back into it.

I don‘t even think I would physically be able to be with her because of the panic and flashbacks I get by even seeing her on a picture, but I am scared that I could ""relapse"" and lose my progress I made in getting away from her.

It was the worst and most hopeless 2 years of my life, a lot happened I won‘t be able to forget, a lot of threats with s*icide and ruining my reputation if I ever spoke up, which is why I get nervous that she could find posts like this, but I‘m just gonna pray that it‘s very unlikely.

Anyone with similar feelings/experiences/ advice? Much love.",,,
1jd1adh,My first boyfriend was abusive and I think I've been blocking things out,throwa09123985,1,2025-03-17 01:27:56+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jd1adh/my_first_boyfriend_was_abusive_and_i_think_ive/,"I have been sorting through some old files on my laptop and came across some diary entries from 10 years ago from my time with my first boyfriend. I don’t remember too much from the relationship back then other than it didn’t end well. We were together from age 16 to 19.

When we broke up, both age 19, he made me pretend to be his girlfriend for two more months so he could avoid having to tell his friends and family and I remember him threatening to punch me by raising his fist to my face. Then he tried to coerce me to leave our shared university so he wouldn’t have to see me anymore.

But what I read in my old diary entries has me worrying I’ve blocked stuff out. I wrote this not long before we broke up: ‘I asked him to pay for something so he said he’s going to hit me 30 times as payment, I think he’s going to keep threatening me with it until he’s done them all. Only 26 more to go. He never actually bruises me though as he doesn’t hit hard, it makes him happy. I’m scared. I don’t want to be hit another 26 times’ - in regards to this, I vaguely remember him doing it sort of as a joke, but with a slightly sinister undertone. Like I let him do it, the punches never hurt, but in hindsight, what the fuck?

And the following were all after we broke up, when he was making me pretend to still be his girlfriend:

‘He said it’s impossible for anyone to respect me, called me fat, and said he can’t wait to have a normal conversation with his friend at uni’

‘He said I’m an easy target, small, autistic, and look like an orc’

‘He raised his fist at me again to my face but stopped last second, when I asked him about it but noticed there was no one in the library to see, he said ‘that’s how I operate, no witnesses’

‘He wouldn’t leave my car and go home, I ended up taking us for a drive to kill time until when his parents were expecting him home, and when we parked up we ended up doing sexual stuff in my car. I sort of wanted to as I was horny, but also didn’t as we're broken up and I am already talking to \*\*\*\* (a new guy's name) but I was mildly scared of what he’d do if I flat out refused, so it was easier to lean into the horny feeling rather than deny it, but now I feel guilty and wrong'

‘He threatened to punch me with keys in his hand, his fist was centimeters from my face and his keys right by my eye. We were arguing because he didn’t want me to come to class tomorrow and ruin his time with his friends and I said I didn’t care and might change our relationship status on facebook to say single, then he got angry and did that'

Until now I've looked back on that time as a 'oh that was a bit messed up but oh well' sort of thing, but I'm wondering what other people make of the situations described?

TL;DR my ex threatened to punch me and tried to coerce me to leave uni, how bad was it?",,,

I'm approved for an apartment and will be moving out one day when he's at work for my safety. I've read ""Why Does He Do That?"".

I just can't understand why he'd always want to yell at me or why he threw his phone at me when I couldn't pick him up from work. The bus system is free and he just had to walk ten minutes from the stop to the house. 

We've been together over a decade and I loved him. The fact he showed me he had the capability to hurt me shattered my heart. Has he always hated me? Was I just a convenient choice? The yelling and cursing and slamming despite knowing it scares me shows he doesn't respect me at all. 

I love my new apartment and can't wait to move in, but I sometimes find my brain coming back to this when I reread the note I'm going to leave behind. 

Why does he hate me this much? He tells me he loves me but his actions say otherwise. Why didn't he respect me? Why did he bother to move across the country with me if he was just going to treat me like this? Why did I see a future with him?

I defended his actions to my friends and I just feel so stupid. They tell me I'm not but I feel like I am. 

I'm sorry. I just needed to vent somewhere. I haven't been able to get this out. ",,,

This has been our first year having a coparent agreement now that we’ve been separated for a few years. I was unaware during mediation that they do not give advice, so our custody agreement is very loosely written which is now biting me in the ass almost every time my kids go over for a visit. 

They go every other weekend. Their dad works every Saturday for most of the day. We have 3 kids and has girlfriend has 4 kids. This is leaving her with 7 kids to watch. My 2 older children have iPhones that are only connected through WiFi, and my youngest has a tablet with an app I can message and call her on. They bought her a tablet and downloaded the same app so I can message her since they don’t want her bringing her tablet from home anymore. 
I’m unsure what the conversation was that the girlfriend had with my youngest while Dad was at work, but she logged my daughter out of the  app so I can no longer talk to her. The Dad is backing up the girlfriend and said he will continue to block communication from me and my kids during their visits. 

I’m not sure what I should do. Lawyers are expensive. If I go to court is this something a judge would even side with me about? I don’t talk to them the entire time they are gone, but my oldest do sends me messages saying hello or they miss me or love me.

Just trying to reconcile how I am feeling, especially now that I am considering divorce. 

Background: My spouse has always been a ""safe"" and caring person. He provides a good life for me and has supported me through some tough stuff with my health in the past. He financially has taken care of me. I don't really have family to fall back on.

So tell me what you think about these 2 scenarios.

1. My husband and I have never really been sexually compatible, even prior to marriage. I thought we could work through it/it would fix itself or told myself/ acted like it wasn't a big deal. I spent years trying to coach him and work through it, after awhile, I just gave up, I was tired of coaching, it wasn't getting better. I also feel a layer of judgement exists in this area, and I can't ever be really comfortable being myself. I take care of my needs myself now, and I often decline sex, bc I don't want to deal w/ things, but that leads to coercive things happening (repeatedly asking, getting mad if I say no, reminding me how many weeks/days it has been and how that is unfair, compromising on what we do, me just doing it bc I don't want to be pestered about it later, and trying to make it happen quickly). I get it, he has needs, but I feel like I kind of created this situation.

2. He wants kids, I said I wanted them, but later. I kept pushing the date of when we would try back, 30, then 34, and now I am 36. I thought I would warm to the idea of it over time (or I really hoped I would, genuinely). He got really pushy about it lately, which I get, we are running out of time. So I agreed to try, because that was what he wanted, and  I should just do that because he has been good to me (not because I wanted kids). We tried for a little bit bc I caved from the pressure, then I got panicked, and put my foot down, and was like no. Now we are at an impass. He wants me to consider other options, such as adoption. Yes, I was misleading, but I also think he knew how I felt too. I'm not sure how I should feel about that part either.

I have episodes of generalised Dystonia (painful full body spasms) which cause me to be basically unable to move/ control my movements or to speak. It’s a horrible experience on its own because you feel so out of control of your body and like it’s actively fighting against you. 

My ex used to treat me even worse than usual while it was happening. Calling me names, telling me I looked ugly and mimicking the involuntary twisting movements that are part of dystonia. It was so distressing in an already distressing situation. And then that turned into my ex sexually abusing me while I was unable to physically do anything or verbally say no. They said I was lucky that they were even be attracted to me given how [r slur]ed I looked.

I don’t get big episodes like that as often any more (sometimes I wonder if my ex was purposely triggering them, but that’s a different post), but I’m recovering from a big one a few days ago and it’s just brought back those horrible moments of being completely unable to control my body or what happens to it.  I should be focussing on physical rest and recovery but my PTSD is so bad that I’m having to focus on that instead which is delaying my recovery. It feels so cruel that my abuser is still making these episodes 1000x worse than they already are.

1jczfap,I need help,bajatoad,1,2025-03-16 23:55:01+00:00,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jczfap/i_need_help/,"Hello, I really need to know if I’m in the wrong or crazy. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend since last February and things have gotten really bad. I met him in January and at the time he was 17, then turning 18 in April (I was 18 going on 19 later that year in October). I had just gotten out of a five year abusive relationship with my ex. 

It started in March when he started to treat me bad, but he would always say how he’s a bad boyfriend. Quickly after, he would start calling me names like “whore, bitch, stupid, idiot, retarded…” etc. He would say that we were breaking up, but the next day everything would be back to normal again. 

He doesn’t give me the same respect that I give him. I removed all lot of guys off my phone for him, without him having to ask, because I saw that they made him feel uncomfortable. He would make remarks about the guys on my phone so I just removed them. 

Sometime in March we got into a fight and he came down to see me. (For better context, my ex abused me mentally and physically so I grew very nervous around men) We were sitting near pond and I guess I was speaking over him and he threatened to hit me if I didn’t stop talking. 

I started to get really depressed because of this and I couldn’t hide it anymore. He would constantly say that I need to get better and I really was trying to get better, but he would make it worse, so I didn’t know how. He constantly blamed everything on me. 

(Because of my ex, I didn’t trust him 100% in the beginning and I was nervous a lot. My ex would constantly cheat, manipulate, and abuse me everyday for 5 years, so yeah.. that did a number on me) My boyfriend knows what my ex did to me and still continued to abuse me mentally. 

In August I went up on the train to see him because we had a big argument and he was ignoring me. (He stonewalls me every time he’s mad and I can’t take it. He knows that I have really bad abandonment issues because of my childhood, and still did it to hurt me.) He picked me up from the train station and all he did was verbally abuse me. I was bawling my eyes out and trying to hold his arm for comfort and he said that he was going to kill me/us and crash the car. Later that day we went to a carnival together and he acted like nothing ever happened. 

I personally think that porn or watching anything online is cheating. (That’s just me.) The other day he said that he was on Reddit and then I heard sounds of him jerking off. I asked if that’s what he was doing and he said no. I brought it up the next day and he said that he was watching stuff I’ve sent him. But his stories aren’t lining up, he constantly does this and gaslights me. I feel like I’m going crazy in my head. He’s really good at manipulating people and making me seem like the crazy girlfriend. 

Last night I went through his phone because I had suspicions of him cheating. There was nothing on his Reddit, but when I went into Snapchat, there were multiple girls on there. He was telling girls to pull up to a festival that he was at, and I couldn’t go that day. So I woke him up and confronted him. It went terribly. He got in my face and called me a retard and many other things. He started punching my bed and said that if he didn’t do that, then he would punch me. I was able to record what he said. He left but came back later that night and ignored me. This morning I asked him if we could talk about it again and it went bad aswell. He said that I need to get myself together and that I need to get better and I need to go back to the pychward to get better. (I went years ago because I tried to off myself because my ex was telling me to take more pills and that I was worthless.) He told me that he doesn’t care about me and he won’t remove the girls. 

My problem with the girls is that he told me he removed them, and lied to me about it, and he doesn’t show any signs of remorse. I would never add or talk to guys behind his back. I just want the same respect back. He tells me that I’m insecure and crazy, but he’s a very insecure person. I always tell him how handsome he is, and that I love every part of him (and I really do.) Last week he went through my following and sent me a picture of my cousin and said “WTF WERE OVER”. I told him that it was my cousin but he still blocked me. He came back the next day. 

I’m exhausted and he’s taken everything out of me. 

And I know that I’m not perfect at all, and I do make mistakes, but I don’t purposefully try to hurt him. I’ve definitely changed since we first started dating. In our first argument I asked if he was stupid (I didn’t know how to communicate at that time and just had left my abusive ex), he told me not to speak to him like that, and it clicked in my head. I didn’t want to become what my ex was, and I knew i didn’t want to treat him like that. For months I worked on myself, but he would say that I wasn’t changing at all. But I knew I was changing. 

He wonders why I don’t trust him, but he constantly lies about small things and it makes me wonder if he lies about bigger things too. On Thanksgiving I caught him with a vape and he said that he didn’t care. He told me to stop smoking weed back in March, so I stopped. So it really hurt to find out that he didn’t care and was going to continue if he didn’t get caught. A little part of me still believes that he’s doing it. 

(I’m new to Reddit so I’m sorry if I don’t understand too much hhh. I’m also sorry if things are in a weird order, I’m writing this as things come to my mind.) ",,,

1jcxtsg,What's a normal level of comfort you can expect while crying?,ThrowAway44228800,3,2025-03-16 22:40:08+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcxtsg/whats_a_normal_level_of_comfort_you_can_expect/,"So I've been pondering this for a little while. A bit ago, I had a very emotional reaction in public where I was crying pretty hard. A person I'm close to hugged me for a while and then spoke to me for \~45 minutes until I calmed down.

It was really nice. It's the first time I think I actually felt better after crying. Anyway is this normal or is this the exception? Like can I expect this behavior from other people, or did I just get super lucky? My parents would've yelled at me for crying, and then tried to hug me and yelled at me for not wanting to be hugged, and then yelled at me for not telling them what was wrong, and then yelled at me for making a scene in public (in that order), so I don't actually have a concept of what I should expect.

I really liked how this person handled it. I know I shouldn't be trying to have breakdowns in public in hopes of support, but I will be sad if my parents' reactions are the normal ones. I like being able to be not calm for a bit because I can trust that the other person can help calm me down. When I was younger I could never fully be upset because I knew I'd be forced to be quiet immediately.",,,

1jcwiva,What could someone have said to wake you up from your nightmare?,praeda_,8,2025-03-16 21:40:51+00:00,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcwiva/what_could_someone_have_said_to_wake_you_up_from/,"Im looking for advice and support for my big brother. He's in an abusive relationship with his wife and my concern for him has peaked. Sorry for the format, I'm typing on my phone. Also I'm in the UK.

My (F25) brother (35) is an ex-army veteran and has been with his wife for 2 years now. Like a lot of abusive relationships, it was perfect in the beginning for him, with lots of love bombing. Then she switched personalities and he's been living in hell for the last 16 months. He had described the abuse, it is verbal, emotional, mental and has recently become physical. The worst of it (and this is what is told to me through other family members) includes plates being thrown and hand prints on his arm from her tight grip on his arm. There are plenty more examples of her abuse, but I have only heard it through the grapevine, what other family members tell me. That's because she doesn't let him speak to me. She harbours a very particular hate towards me as the youngest sibling for a whole other story. 

Now, our family has tried to be supportive to him. We've done all we think we can for him, bar springing him physically from his situation. 
In the UK, you can do a DVDS application (search Clares law) and I have done this on his behalf. We have also reported incidences of DV to the police on his behalf. Unfortunately, this was a couple weeks ago now so I'm not sure what's come of it.
My brother is a shell of himself. He is usually goofy, well maintained and has a glimmer in his eye. That has gone. He is so defeated. 
He will tell us, the family, one thing and then do the other. He says about how at their next counselling session he will say this and that, and he never does. He says he will hold her to her ultimatums and then doesn't.
His wife is the dictionary definition of a narcissist. I'm pretty sure if I searched up 'narcissist' now I'd just get her picture come up. 

He knows his relationship is unhealthy. He knows he cannot walk on eggshells for the rest of his life. He knows he cannot live a double life, pretending he doesn't speak to his family for his wife's peace. He doesn't have the energy, or whatever it is he needs, to finally make that call and leave for good.
The thing is, she is very sick herself. She deals with a miriad of mental illness (so I've been told) and she actually hid a lot of it from him at the beginning. Her behaviour is erratic, explosive and downright dangerous. Many of the stories of abuse I've heard about are the product of her behaviour.
My brother is a very loving, sweet man. He considers family, relstionships and loyalty extremely important, I imagine it's the army background. I know he wants to be a good man and husband and he made a vow to stick by her, for better or for worse. But this, this is beyond your vows. She made them too.
I have made the argument to my family that if this situation and its genders were swapped, we would have taken action at the first utter of abuse. I have 2 sisters, and I cannot imagine that if they had experienced what my brother has that their partner would not be in jail right now.
 
My family all agree that something needs to be done. We have a safe house for him if he needs it, somewhere she doesn't know. We have reminded him. We have told him our feelings about this. 
I know leaving her has to be his decision. He has to ring that bell, no one else. I believe he has already made his cries for help, but we can only lead a horse to water. 
I really want to be brutally honest, tell him he's pushing his family away when he relents to her obscene demands, or message her myself. (Im blocked anyways lol) But I know it'll fall back on him and I don't want be the cause of any of his hurt. He knows this isn't okay, he knows it can't continue. I just want him free.
Is there anything particular I can say to him? Anything that will take him out of his nightmare?",,,
1jcvtrj,"Am I in an Abusive Relationship (30m and 24f, need hep seeing things clearly)",helenaod,4,2025-03-16 21:09:48+00:00,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcvtrj/am_i_in_an_abusive_relationship_30m_and_24f_need/,"I’ve been with my boyfriend (30M) for three years, and I (24F) am really struggling to figure out if what I’m experiencing is abuse or just an unhealthy dynamic. I feel so emotionally exhausted and trapped in a cycle where I constantly doubt myself. Some days, he’s sweet and affectionate, hugging and kissing me and talking about how he wants to be together forever, and I feel like I’m overreacting about everything. Other days, he’s cold, distant, dismissive, or outright controlling.

Here are some of the things that make me question my situation:

* He’s obsessed with money—reading finance books, writing money affirmations, and pushing me to save a specific amount every month.
* He put some of my money into stocks before I fully understood them. I didn’t get much of a say.
* He wanted me to open a Roth IRA before I fully grasped what it was.
* He doesn't want me to pay rent , but instead, he expects me to put money aside for a house he wants to buy.
* He makes me feel guilty for spending my own money on things like food or small personal expenses. If I order takeout, he acts annoyed or makes passive-aggressive comments.
* We never go on real dates and rarely travel because he sees it as a waste of money. The best date we go on is fast food. He makes $100-170k per year and I offer to pay too. 
* Even though I just started my current job a month ago, he’s already telling me to find a better paying one ASAP. 
* I have to wake up at like 5 for work but he's annoyed I go to bed at 8 (I have insomnia so it takes me a long time to fall asleep), and go to the gym, even though he ignores me often when we're together and usually plays like 10-15 hours of video games on the weekends. 
* Today he got annoyed 3 times before 6:30 AM (once at the cat for begging, once at the TV, once at me).

* He rarely compliments me, either on my looks or my personality.
* When we visit my family (like my grandma), he sometimes acts miserable even though I didn’t even ask him to come.
* He won't acknowledge me when I talk to him a lot**,** making me feel like I’m being ignored on purpose.
* If I thank him for something, he’ll sometimes say nothing in response. 
* His moods change a ton**.** One day he’s affectionate and telling me he loves me, the next he’s distant or annoyed several times for no clear reason.

* He refused to wear condoms when I asked, even though I was struggling with hormonal birth control side effects.
* When I tried to discuss it with him, he got angry and turned it into a fight instead of considering my health and comfort.
* He then told me my perspective on this makes absolutely no sense and he wants me to take bc pills for MY pleasure. 
* One time, during sex, I told him it had been hurting after he had been going for an hour**.** I had to physically push him off me, and then he ignored me the entire night because he was furious.

* He keeps pushing me to renew the lease today, even though it isn't due until April.
* We have had so many arguments over politics (he has become more and more right-wing and is extremely upset and offended that I don't love Donald Trump and Elon Musk)**.** He was furious after voting day when I told him who I voted for. 
* My therapist believes firmly that this is an abusive relationship. 

  
But... 

* He’s never really physically hurt me or screamed at me, so I wonder if I’m overthinking.
* He often acts sweet, chivalrous, and loving, which makes me second-guess whether I’m blowing things out of proportion.
* He says he loves me, kisses and hugs me, and holds my hand all the time. 
* My mom says this is all likely attachment issues (me anxious him avoidant) and advises relationship counseling. 

I go back and forth constantly**.** One moment, I’m sure this is emotional abuse. The next, I wonder if I’m just being too sensitive.

So…is this abuse? Is it just toxic? Or is this all just normal? Any advice would help. ",,,

Since day 1 I had never experienced someone like him but I just brushed jt aside because I loved him so so much. In the beginning we would have a blow out fight and he would call my parents and try to convince them I did XYZ, and try to make them be on his side. He would tell me to get over being violently raped less than a year prior. Over time it escalated to intense, intense screaming. He was drunk one night and pushed me to the ground and choked me. My throat hurt to touch for a week. He told every one of his friends and family that I DID that to him. I told his dad and he said it was probably “an accident”. From then forward when we would argue I would hide in a bedroom and he would break the lock, break the door down. I got an extra lock, he broke that off too. He would stand in the doorway so I can’t leave the room. If he don’t move out of the way I would say I’m going to push you if you don’t move. I would push him and he would dramatically fall over as if I literally threw him across the room, and tell me I am abusive. Take my keys, block the driveway, get into my vehicle. Make my parents come pick me up. He sends hundreds and hundreds of text and 200+ phone calls any time there is an issue. Multiple times when I have gone to stay elsewhere he was pretended to get in car accidents, hurt himself, be in crisis at work, pretend unalive himself and move is car front infront of the camera so I wouldn’t see if he is home and shut his phone off after saying he’s going to. Oh he’s also pulled a gun out while fighting many times. I wish I could explain the manipulation and things he does/ says to me but there has just been so so so much. I have recorded some arguments and played them for my therapist, my mom has first hand seen and heard him, I share our texts with people and ask them to tell me if it’s me. No one will say it’s me. I begged my therapist to tell me if I am the problem and she said she would tell me if I am. I have started to get really angry when he just yells and yells at me non stop for hours on end and I won’t even speak or do a thing. Today we were driving home and he was yelling at me again for 20 minutes straight, told me I am just like his mom (who is an extremely sick bipolar narcissist) and it just sent me. I threw a soda at him and told him to get the fuck out. I stopped the vehicle so fast my poor dog hit the dash. It broke my heart I am currently crying because I feel so bad my dog hit it. My dogs get so scared when he yells they shake and pant the entire time. Usually I leave and take them with me. I feel like I have just hit a point where I feel like I am going to snap and be violent. And After he pushes me for so long I end up saying mean things too and I don’t want to. I have hit him back, I have thrown things at him, I have spit on him. I give it back to him just to try to get him away from me. He chases me around and blows me up. I am starting to feel like I am the problem. Everyone tells me to leave and that he is abusive and manipulative but I feel like I can’t. I have no money, he won’t let me get a job, he sold my car, he pays for everything. I have nothing. ",,,

I just said I couldn’t talk and he’s resuming speaking with me as if no time has passed? For context, he was verbally abusive for the last 10 months of our relationship, mostly via WhatsApp. I also lost a stupid amount of ££££ as he always made me cover so much and gift him. Just feel deflated as I’ve made SO much progress since we finished in September (went on my first trip in over 6 months this week, have lost a lot of weight because I was carrying extra baggage due to stress caused by him and overeating, have tried to eat healthy and manage my disability).

1jctb7z,How do you know when you’re ready to date again after abuse?,throwawaycrazymessy,4,2025-03-16 19:19:44+00:00,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jctb7z/how_do_you_know_when_youre_ready_to_date_again/,"I was with him for 6 years. It was very physical and he ended up being arrested. He has really bad charges including strangulation x3.. so he is facing up to 50+ years. He hasn’t been sentenced he got arrested in November. 

I recently had a friend who I’d known for 5 years want to pursue me. He is an amazing guy and very understanding, but I kept getting so anxious about everything. I was worrying about things that didn’t matter now. I was so worried about the distance (LDR), if one of us would eventually be able to move, I even got extremely nervous about him having a pitbull and one day making the move in with my cats suddenly. I was just so nervous about everything and I realized I think I was looking for the tiniest red flags to look for and be scared to death about. I let it get obsessive for me posting multiple times on reddit about the things I was nervous about that really I didn’t even need to be yet. It didn’t seem like a healthy way to start off feeling consumed by dread for no reason and obsessing over anything that could go wrong. 

It hasn’t even been four full months since everything happened and truly I wasnt the type of person that was already “over” the guy I was with before this.. I very much loved him when he got arrested. I got concerned that this is just much too early for me to jump back into things if it was giving me so much anxiety despite the guy I was talking to now making me feel comfortable. Since I had been friends with him so long, I decided to tell him I needed to figure out who I am before dating again. I ended it before it truly fully began. I probably honestly ruined our friendship, but in the long run I don’t want to hurt a great guy I was friends with so long by jumping the gun. I do hope I won’t regret that I made that decision. 

I still have nightmares about the abuse I faced. I still think about it daily as well it’s hard not to. I still feel guilty about him being arrested even though I know I shouldn’t and I even sometimes feel guilty when I get a really good meal knowing he’s in there eating jail food and stuck in a cell. I also feel I did lose myself some, and I don’t fully know who I am on my own. Most of my interest are tied to him, and although I know I like these things separately it still feels a bit weird sometimes. Yesterday after I made my decision I reached out to multiple places to see if I can get into low cost therapy as I don’t have insurance. I’m hoping this will work out for me.

I just feel so lost on knowing when I should start dating again. I don’t want to right after just cutting this guy loose, I really liked him and I need to focus on myself. However, I don’t know when I’ll know I am ready. I know you’ll always be scared after this, but it is so confusing. I don’t really know how to tell I am ready. ",,,
1jct0pz,How do I know what’s true?,EmptyAd4359,2,2025-03-16 19:07:28+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jct0pz/how_do_i_know_whats_true/,"Sorry… this is a long one. TLDR at the end. 

My common law SO and I are in limbo between being together and not being together. We have been in a relationship for almost 5 years and have a 2 year old together. He also has two older kids from his previous marriage. I ended things with him several weeks ago because I had had enough of the emotional and verbal abuse, as well as the looming risk of it turning into physical abuse also and not just towards myself. 

The day after I ended things he came back to me and said that he is never going to be the cruel man he has been to his loved ones. He’s going to counseling for his anger and depression, and he’s doing lots of reading and listening to podcasts on methods of managing big emotions. I believed this was genuine and gave in to couples’ counseling with him. We had our first session last week and it went fine; he took accountability for all the crap he’s done and the psychologist seemed to believe he’s being genuine as well. 

Flash forward to a couple of days ago when I was speaking with my own counselor about whether I should remain separated or give the relationship another shot. I was feeling confident about trying again but received a text from his ex-wife while I was in my counseling session. She called me the night that I ended the relationship with my SO and made sure my toddler and I were safe and that if he hit me or did anything physical I needed to call the police. I appreciated her concern and for what must’ve been an awkward call to make. The text she sent me the other day asked to talk to me on the phone. We spoke for about an hour where she gave details about her marriage to him, including that he would chase her, make physical threats, and wasn’t safe around the kids when he was angry. She also said that he cheated on her with escorts and prostitutes right after she gave birth to their first child because she wouldn’t “put out” fast enough. She told me about a recent incident that happened between my SO and their first child. 

My first inclination was to fully and completely end this relationship, that there is no salvaging this because the threat of ongoing abuse will always exist for my child and I. Three things that I can’t reconcile with:
1. My SO apologizes for what he has done to me every single day and talks about what he’s doing to be better for us, and that he will never ever be that awful man to us again. He seems genuine… I don’t want to be a fool and make a stupid decision (either staying because I believe him or giving up on a relationship with the father of my child who is actually bettering himself).
2. Whenever he “cries” there are no tears, he just furrows his brow and it sounds like his voice is choking up. He recovers fairly quickly and maintain intense eye contact while “crying”. I’ve often wondered if he is being genuine but don’t want to discount that some people just don’t fully cry. 
3. I don’t know anything about his ex-wife to be able to know whether I should trust what she told me or not. The same goes for their oldest son - I have caught him in lies before and he’s quite intelligent. There is a possibility that details were exaggerated to put my SO in a very bad position in which the two older kids would live with their mother full-time which is where they seem to be happiest anyway. 

Please, please tell me if I’m just finding a way to take the easy route of giving it another try? I don’t know if he’s a narcissist to begin with, and now I’m so bothered by the possibility that he paid for sex in the past so why wouldn’t he have done that after I had our baby and he was so angry that I didn’t want to be intimate with him for a long while. I need help figuring out who to believe and what to do. My gut changes its mind on the daily. I also don’t know if I should continue going to couples counseling with him, and if I should talk to the psychologist privately and tell him about the abuse in my relationship and the allegations of abuse from his previous?

TLDR: my SO has been emotionally and verbally abusive towards me. His ex-wife told me about physical abuse in their marriage. My SO seems to be genuinely working on himself. I don’t know who to trust or if I should give this another chance because he’s the father of my child.

Firstly the other day he confided about a bunch of scary health stuff he's going through and waiting on different tests results, and even though that's not my personal problem and it doesn't negate how he treats me or our shared partner, ""they left me because of x"" is not a part of his narrative I am personally comfortable allowing to have happen at this time. Maybe he will hear back within a week or two and not be sick and it's all good but presently I'm not walking 2 days after being informed of this.

Second, he called out of work yesterday so instead of just me and our girlfriend it was all three of us - roadblocking some conversations I needed to have with her first in order to feel safe about leaving. This is a must for me to be able to proceed safely given certain things I can't get into here.

In the meantime, despite desperately wanting to cut things off, I obviously still love him and just feel fucking miserable. It's quite clear he doesn't want me so I don't know why he just doesn't end it. He was very affectionate with her at an event last night and not with me at all. Rarely wants to cuddle. I can't remember the last time he complimented me and I don't think we have had sex since one time around Christmas (the past few weeks I now know are because he's been dealing with the health matters and therefore doesn't feel like it, which I totally get). All of this to say since he's not even nice to me or rarely talks to me/engages with me when I'm around? Why are you still with me.

I really, really miss feeling wanted and feeling attractive and someone being excited to talk to me or want to touch me. ",,,

How can I bring this up to her , I wanna talk about it but what kind of questions do I ask her?

I’m not sure all speculation but I’m a guy btw but she told me in the past maybe a couple months ago “if I’m ever in a bad situation are you willing to pick me up “ , right after she told me that she had a big argument with him a month prior 

Also the way she talks about him to me at times sounds like he’s kinda degrading him 

Talking about he always shows up to her house unexpected after his work and that her dad dislikes him being there 24/7 after his work

She once was hanging out with her friends and he got mad and threatened one of his friends and after that day I doubt she has seen her friends it feels like he has limited the people who she interacts with other than him and her family 

In addition she once told me don’t worry your love life will be better than mine which made me think a lot 

Lastly she once said “all the drugs and alcohol when he gets aggressive ik when to walk away” 

Can someone pls give me insight if this is signs of abuse or am I being delusional

I'm so heartbroken and upset and planning on leaving him soon but I feel SO much guilt to leave him.

I really do love him but around two days ago he slapped me through the face for trying to take his phone out of his hand ( he had been messaging escorts earlier that day) 


And now the daycare is telling me our son is having issues and I had to tell them what is going on... I also spoke to a lady today and she told me if I don't leave child protective could step in. He isn't physically abusive to my son, but when he is Angry he will swear at me in front of our son and he slapped me in front of him. 

I honestly feel like it is my fault. His mom also tells me that I pushed him to go to sex workers etc cos I keep questioning him.. the only reason I kept asking him was because he had cheated for 8 months in our married at massage parlors without me knowing, then had a one night stand with a girl in her car, and didn't do the work to make me feel safe to trust him again. Yes we have life 360 and accountability app...but his emotional abuse hasn't changed.  He was really nice for a while and then it started again. It makes me hella confused because I feel like I ""see"" the man I love and then instantly he can change into SUCH a horrible person and say the horrobliest things to hurt me.

He also stopped taking his antidepressants which lead to this huge outburst the other day. Kicking my dog, making me re-home him, then the slamming counters and a day later slapping me and telling me he wants me dead. 

He says it's due to not taking his meds. What do I believe? Give him a chance or get away. Everything is so confusing and I'm so hurt. ",2025-03-14 14:28:44,2025-03-17 02:11:29,all_new_posts
1jb4dqw,How has your abuser affected your sleep?,selfishcoffeebean,26,2025-03-14 13:51:24+00:00,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jb4dqw/how_has_your_abuser_affected_your_sleep/,"Hi All,

First, I want to express gratitude to this community. You all have helped me greatly over the last year, and I still rely on this sub daily to help me understand what happened to me. 

Second, I am taking a course on sleep and mental health. For my term paper, I’ve decided to focus on how abusive relationships impact sleep quality, time, pattern, disturbances, etc. - for you, for your kids (if applicable), and possibly your abuser.  I want to do the subject justice and hear from multiple voices, not just my own. 

*How is/was your sleep impacted by your abuser?* 

———————————————————————

My personal situation: 
- my abuser would play loud action movies while I slept, on a laptop next to our bed. He refused to wear headphones.  In fact, I was made to wear white noise headphones instead, which only added to the noise levels. He accused me of not caring about his sleep quality by asking him to turn the volume down. 

- my abuser would insist that I stay awake until 10/11pm so we could “spend time together” aka watch TV. We both had early jobs and commutes so he’d start ignoring his alarm at 3:30am. My sleep need is 8.5h and I averaged 5-5.5h for the three years I was tracking it. 

- my abuser would punish me if I woke up past 7am on weekends because he had a tightly regimented schedule (in theory…) and if I strayed by even a few minutes he would blame his lack of productivity for the rest of the day on me. He has severe ADHD with many RSD episodes. 

- my abuser would sexually assault me in my sleep. Sleep was not a safe place for me. 

- my abuser went through my phone several times while I was asleep, which always caused me to be on edge when I would hear him standing over my side of the bed. 

- my abuser could survive off of 4h of sleep, and did so regularly. He would “self medicate” with alcohol to counteract the insane dose of adderall he was on (up to 80mg per day, I shit you not) so he could fall asleep. While there were always signs of him being a controlling monster, I believe it was aggravated by his poor sleep quality and certainly by the alcohol abuse. 

- even my cats suffered. They stopped sleeping with us, probably because of the noise. 

I firmly believe that I stayed in this relationship, and was susceptible to sexual coercion and overwhelming control, because he was intentionally depriving me of sleep. I was not in my right mind. ",2025-03-14 13:51:24,2025-03-17 02:11:31,all_new_posts

he’s out of my life now almost completely, i am so relieved. the anxiety of bumping into him still lingers but im so so glad that i will never have to experience something like that ever again. i removed him off everything, blocked his number and deleted all our photos. i was stuck living with him for 2 years, 3 years of dating before that, i genuinely didn’t ever think i was going to be able to get out of it.

i am now in a new relationship, he was also in an abusive relationship with his ex girlfriend, so it’s working really well for us being able to understand each other and what it was like. seeing how relationships are meant to be and feel like is super healing, going outside again, going on dates, going clubbing again, seeing my friends that i had to cut off. i am slowly feeling like myself again. i didn’t realise how bad my ex was until i noticed my boyfriend wanted me to have lots of friendships and experience life together. i am remembering things from my previous relationship that have helped me move on and realise i deserved better and i wasn’t crazy. being in a healthy relationship has alleviated so much anxiety and i dont feel worried with him ever. i just feel so secure and safe! 

i still have a long way to go, but i am thinking of all of you that are still in abusive relationships or healing from them. i had previously deleted all my posts after my ex found my reddit account, but i was frequently posting here and i am so so so grateful for all your help and encouragement that lead me to where i am today.",2025-03-14 13:29:38,2025-03-17 02:11:32,all_new_posts

I have a friend who is having to leave a man who is becoming increasingly domestically abusive. He doesn’t stand a chance in hell of getting custody of their kids or any assets as they didn’t have a lot combined. 

My question is twofold: how can I make this man’s life really inconvenient and remain anonymous (and legal)? I don’t want to harm him just cause him mild every day irritation. 

I’d love nothing more than to see him not do well but long term it would not benefit my friend or their kids for this man to be angry. How can I irritate him to the fullest extent without it becoming illegal, harassment, or being traced back to me. 

I am not above putting prawns in his curtain rods if that gives you any idea. 

I can’t help my friend, luckily she has a very supportive family and a good legal standing. I just want to see what I can do. Not sure if this is the right subreddit but looking for something in any corner of reddit. ",2025-03-14 13:24:59,2025-03-17 02:11:33,all_new_posts
1jb3168,"My ex bf wanted and probably cheated on me, am i correct?",Alemanyyyyy_,1,2025-03-14 12:44:22+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jb3168/my_ex_bf_wanted_and_probably_cheated_on_me_am_i/,"Im already healed, im just a bit angry still, but overall okay, dont worry about me. I want to share this experience with you guys so if someone needs to flee, they feel better about it. I (20, f.) was with my ex (21, m.) for almost two years when i dumped him.

Originally, i didnt dump him for cheating or physical abuse. I left for the emotional abuse, the manipulation, the hypocritical treatment, and for insulting and having a low concept of me. I wasnt having that, and at that point it was just easier and overal better to just be single than to keep giving him free labour, so i dumped him past nov. 5. Good riddance, i started to feel better inmediatly after. No more memory gaps, no more swelling, my panick attacks were gone, my acne improved overnight, and loads of mental space just for me and my own stuff. It was the most amazing feeling, the best relief ive ever had.

I posted here some time ago that he had some girl chasing him for years, all the time our relationship lasted. I had told him already that i wasnt comfortable with him keeping contact with her. I didnt trust her intentions. She would unfollow him whenever he would post pics with me, and some time later he would accept her solicitude back. He was gonna meet with her, without telling me. He not only didnt tell me he was gonna go meet her, i had already told him to not go out with her because they werent even friends. He had female platonic friends, and she was not between them. Thes SHE stood HIM up 😭💀And then he came to complain to me, like the stupid little b he always was. At first i thought “nah, he was not gonna cheat, if he wanted why would he tell me?”. But he was just that dumb. He didnt told me before hand because he didnt want me to know he was going on a date. He used to tell me when he would go out with friends, so that was obvious.

But i was tired of this bs. I told him he had two choices: to block her in everything and delete her number, or not do it, but then i would leave him. He had the audacity to try and dismiss me. He then told me he didnt want to be the “bad guy” because “she just recieved some very bad news from her gynecologist”. I told him i didnt care if her mom died, that he needed to make a choice. I would have left him then and there, i wasnt gonna allow him that level of disrespect. I refuse to live with the doubt that im being cheated on. He finally did, after daring to hesitate. But now, i feel he surely did cheat on me. Maybe other girl, other account, maybe he unblocked her. But he wanted to. So, i dont have any proof, maybe he hid it better that time. But now i cant stop thinking, yes he did.

He wanted to feel important and powerful, he treated me like a subordinate even knowing i would resist. He once hit me. In the moment i wanted to think it was a joke, i was surprised that he abused his strenght with me (im 1, 62 m, he was a jacked 1, 83 guy). But yeah, he wanted to hurt me. It was play fighting but he slapped me across the face without hesitation. He would show me off occasionally, ignoring me during the entire hangout with his friends. I would entretain myself, i would be socializing with em, having fun. He later would argue with me and tell me i “humiliated” (?) him and i “ignored him” totally. One of those occasions he didnt even sit near me, he was sitting in the other extreme of the room. He didnt talk to me. I was basically on my own in a room full of people i didnt really knew. Then their friend would make a well intended joke to crack him up, like “ahhh, she has you on a leash, ya?” (Common saying here in my country). He later berated ME for this joke his friend made. I was pissed. He left me on my own and had the audacity to get mad at me.

He was also so uncomfortable with my past, he told me that i neede to be “exactly like his mom” (that he knows is in an abusive marriage), that i needed to go to church every sunday when married (he always knew im an atheist and i have an opinion about organized religion), that “i needed to stop having panick attacks because it would scare our future kids and they would think hes a monster”. He would shout at me on public spaces until i would have a panick attack or a nervous breakdown. Then he would act like it was all good, and i was being unreasonable when i didnt want him hugging me, when i was afraid of him touching me, and i would yell at him to do not even try and touch me. I dont know why i was so slow at seeing i was being abused. I was literally repulsed thinking about getting pregnant and him being the father, i was thinking i would rather die than to give that man children, and it didnt get any better when he told me that i had six years MAX to start having kids, being six years “late”. This dusty ass man was demanding my body, demanding kids, demanding submission. He was always mad at me . The phrase referring his mom was because i was not submissive enough to tolerate the bullshit he was putting me trough, and what his dad was putting his mom trough. My current bf says he wanted me to be like his mom, because that dinamic was beneficial to the man in charge, and he was mad and frustrated i wasnt allowing him to exploit me. 

The last straw was when a national catastrophe killed and left a lot of people homeless in our country last november. He said we shouldnt sacrifice any chrismas decorations to donate to them. In that moment i felt pure disgust for him, not for what he did to me, but the selfishness, the entitlement, and the lack of empathy for such a tragedy left me speechless. I told him we wouldnt die for being a bit more frugal and modest for a year. He told me he wanted to see me mourning and being frugal. I asked if he was implying i was hipocrytical. He didnt deny that. I waited until the next day to talk calmly about this, and i told him he couldnt speak to me like that never again, and i never gave him one reason to think im hipocrytical, and he gaslit me and said “wathever”. Then it hit me, he was never gonna treat me better. And he was not gonna do it because he didnt want to. He didnt like me. Then and there i dumped him.

Girls, dont let a dusty ass man, a coward, do any of these things. I swear, its better just being on your own. You re happier and safer. Its not the worst that your love died. It doesnt matter he loves you. Because they never love us enough to stop treating us like shit. But they wouldnt be by our side if we would put them trough the same bullshit they try to make us tolerate.

He begged like a little bitch to take him back, and i not even once considered returning to that. My life is not gonna be that. He hated me but he wanted me back because it was beneficial for him. Dont let them poison your life please. If you relate to any of these, please leave",2025-03-14 12:44:22,2025-03-17 02:11:34,all_new_posts

I definitely don't want to be involved with him again, however I did get PTSD from this. My ""craziness"" maybe could be chalked up to this diagnosis, but I really feel hopeless. To add drama to my life that I was so accustomed to, I slept with a friend (who was my exes closest friend) who was in a committed relationship while his girlfriend was out of town. A completely stupid decision that I regret entirely, as I am friends with both of these people. I truly feel like I did it to start the drama I clearly miss from that relationship. Not only that but in general, just picking fights with men specifically and being hypersexual/crazy to them. Haphazardly sleeping with men casually and feeling hurt when i'm ""rejected"".

Aside from the men drama, I even picked a fight with my parents when everything was peaceful and unprovoked.

It makes me feel disgusted to resort to these things, hopefully a new low to make some changes in my life, but I am just concerned; will my body ever balance itself out, how long will it take. I ghosted him for good back in january, which, in hindsight wasnt that long ago. But this is the longest i've kept him blocked, our relationship was on and off for a year, i dont feel the need to cyberstalk him anymore.

It really feels like the relationship turned me into a worse person over all. I drink so much and smoke so much weed to numb it out. I am in therapy and have my session tomorrow and will be discussing my self destructive tendencies, but my mind is running so much that i cant wait for tomorrow lol. I hate that I still hold this hate to him. I mean I clearly did this in hopes my ex would find out, which this will come out eventually. But i understand that the damage I caused was... not worth the stress at all. this mistake evokes the same physical reaction as i guess a fight with my ex. I'm rambling and all over the place but anyway, I just need tips and advice, other than the focus on yourself exercise journal stop drinking stuff. But i guess thats the only thing i can do?? I just feel so terrible all the time. thanks for reading.",2025-03-14 12:30:15,2025-03-17 02:11:35,all_new_posts

We live together for about 4 more days, and I finally accepted that I should be afraid of him physically, even though he hasn’t ever hit me… yet. 

However he came home the other night and my neighbor knocked on the door. When he answered it the neighbor started SCREAMING at him, about ME.

She threatened to beat me up if I didn’t “shut the fuck up about her dog” 

The kicker is that I just spoke with her earlier and she confronted me about someone leaving notes on her door bitching about the dog. He’s a little extra barky for my taste, but he’s a dog, they bark. I even told her I’ve seen her and her daughter walking with the dog and I think they’re a cute family. It wasn’t me.

So she cusses him out for a solid 3 minutes, I get a video, and now I feel unsafe inside my house and leaving it alone too so that’s fun…

Luckily, this made him do a 180, he’s gone from hostile to protective in the blink of an eye.  He’s escorting me out of the apartment, and he makes sure he walks on the side of me that the neighbors door is on (we live in an apartment so neighbors door is about 6ft from my door she could snatch or open the door and shoot me in .02 seconds)

So. I feel safe around him again. For now. I’m glad I’ve already set a moving day, or else I very well might be second guessing based on his behavior since this incident. 

This sucks. I know he cares for me and wouldn’t let anyone else hurt me. I know he doesn’t even want to hurt me himself, but when he loses control I just can’t take that chance. 

I’m so freaking unsafe right now it’s laughable, not just cuz of others but I am having surgery in a few weeks so I’m not even physically at my strongest. If I was at 100% I would not feel unsafe, it’s very frustrating to be injured at this time 

I called the non-emergency police number but the officer that answered said I had called the wrong precinct for my address and wouldn’t help transfer me. It was a female officer too. 

If there’s no rest for the wicked, I must not be innocent either then cuz JFC the wicked people around me are resting more than me I swear… ",2025-03-14 11:39:38,2025-03-17 02:11:38,all_new_posts

He said he found some of my hidden boxes and later told me he thought I was using them to move out (I had to lie and say they were for selling and sending stuff i didn't need)  he said that we had a bad/rough patch but now we are ok and asked if I thought the same(had to lie again) telling me he loves me and loves everything about me, that I'm beautiful/sexy, he's stopped groping /grabbing me as much, he even as let me sleep when I wanted to a few times. He as barely criticised or complained,  I don't know what's happening. I've noticed he as started hugging me around my neck which i don't like, and yesterday he hugged my neck again and  he wanted a kiss so he pushed on front of left side of my neck to get me to turn my head for a kiss which made a funny noise come out of my mouth.  He is ringing up from his work at least once a day now, asking what ive been upto, what im doing rest of day, what i did at an appointment i had, asking me to write down what i wanna do sexually with him. Wanting me to to show him my toys (he told me last week me using toys is cheating to him and that i made him feel really bad and messed with his confidence/self esteem because I brought toys but don't have sex with him)  he made me sit on sofa for a talk about sex, my sex toys and everything else  I couldnt get up and leave until he had finished. A few nights he as kept me awake because he wanted to talk about sex,my sex toys and stuff, I pleaded and told him im tired and need go sleep last night but he didnt let me untill he finished the conversation. And even then he left the tv on and that messed with my sleep too. 
Am i doing the right thing leaving?  ",2025-03-14 09:19:02,2025-03-17 02:11:39,all_new_posts
1jay8gl,My Parents Emotionally & Physically Abuse Me – How Can I Cope Until I Can Leave ?,mitzzy018,1,2025-03-14 07:18:58+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jay8gl/my_parents_emotionally_physically_abuse_me_how/,"

I’m 18 (turning 19 soon) and still living with my parents.my mother has emotionally and physically abused me. She constantly insults my appearance, calls me ugly, and compares me to others to make me feel worthless. She even once said that when I get married, my husband will never come near me because of how I look.

She also physically hurts me over small things. Once, during my spinal TB treatment, I had trouble eating meat and refused to eat. Instead of understanding, my mother beat me, and when I still refused, my father slapped me twice.

I also tried to stand up against caste discrimination in my family. My cousin married someone from a lower caste, and my parents weren’t happy about it. I said that we shouldn’t discriminate against others and that everyone should be treated equally, but my father slapped me twice for saying that.

Any time I express my own thoughts, my mother tells me, “You live under my roof, eat my food, wear clothes I buy, and study with my money. You don’t get to defend yourself or argue with us.” It feels like she thinks I owe her my obedience just for existing.

I don’t have money to move out yet, and I don’t have anyone in my family I can trust. How can I cope with this situation until I can leave? If anyone has been through something similar, how did you handle it?

1jaw88f,How long do no contact orders usually last?,OkCheesecake7067,1,2025-03-14 04:55:48+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jaw88f/how_long_do_no_contact_orders_usually_last/,"Me and my ex broke up about 8 months ago. He went to jail and got bailed out after 1 night. I do not have a TPO but there was a no contact order placed as part of his bond. I did not press charges. I was told that the no contact order is suppose to last until the court date. Well, its been almost 8 months and I still have not been notified about any court dates. I did not press charges cause 1) I dont want to go to court 2) i dont have money for a lawyer (although the VA told me I don't need a lawyer I don't feel safe going to court without a lawyer either way) 3) i know this sounds pathetic but I actually do still care about him. (Please don't judge me. He is the father of my child and we were together for a long time. I don't want my son growing up thinking ""I can't see daddy cause he is in jail."" Or thinking ""Mommy said I knew daddy when I was a baby but that I can't see him anymore cause he is in jail and I don't remember anything about him cause I was so young when they broke up."") 

I am surprised that the court date has not happened yet cause I hear all kinds of stories on reddit from people who say their TPO or no contact order only lasted a few days or a few weeks. Or that some could not even get a TPO at all even when they showed them evidence of the abuse. Is it different for every country or state?

I live in the state Georgia in the USA by the way.

So far he has no contacted me at all since that order was placed. But I have no doubt that he probably asks others about me or tries to stalk me in other ways. I have no actual proof. But I know that when we were together he has admitted to stalking my youtube comments.",2025-03-14 04:55:48,2025-03-17 02:11:41,all_new_posts

So he couldn’t get to me where I was staying at my family home because my dad had rang the police, and I wasn’t at work that weekend so he couldn’t find me there

He was freaking out, desperate to find me so he went over to his aunt’s house. His aunt who doesn’t even like him and barely speaks to him… yet he thought she’d help him contact me LMAO

Her husband sent the kids upstairs because my ex is freaking them out, he’s that deranged about it. They got him into the living room, tried to calm him down but it wouldn’t work. Ex started being aggressive with his aunt’s husband, trying to get past him to leave, but they wouldn’t let him go because he’s crazy and beats me

His aunt and her husband went out of the room to talk about what to do, like if they should call the police. They closed the door, and her husband was stood in front of the door blocking it so my ex couldn’t get out

They decided that his aunt would call the police and her husband would keep an eye on him in the meantime. Her husband opens the door to the living room: window open, no ex in the room

Crazy motherfucker climbed out a window so he could get to me 😭😭😭 😭😭😭

Sometimes a certain song will come on or I'll pass by a certain smell and I feel overwhelmed at the thought I left my person. 

In our relationship, I wasn't happy because I couldn't get over the past, and sadly, I truthfully didn't believe in his future. (He has had around 5 jobs in 2 years and constantly gets fired)

He has been genuinely sadistic toward me on several occasions sexually and verbally, and I hate the word trauma bonded because the connection I felt when it was good felt like he was my soulmate and we were the only two people in the world that spoke a certain language. 

He isn't just mean, he is handsome and funny and makes clever jokes and he can be warm and inviting and nurturing, we love the same music, movies, books, food, we had so much chemistry, we did every kind of adventure, our inner kids got to run around. 

He always wanted me, confusingly even when he was mean, but after he tried to provoke me into hitting him (the reason we broke up) I told him I didn't see a future because I am not being involved in domestic violence and he completely shut me out. Changed his phone number, deleted my phone number, all of our pictures, wouldn't open his door to me and hasn't spoken to me in 2 months. 

I love him more than I have ever loved anyone I've dated and at the same time I feel deeply traumatized by this relationship. The good parts were so good. And typing this out I understand how I sound, and other people like me in similar situations sound. But the love you feel is so real :(",2025-03-14 02:22:47,2025-03-17 02:11:49,all_new_posts
1jat8rw,Overwhelmed,AmericanInCanada25,1,2025-03-14 02:08:16+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jat8rw/overwhelmed/,"I was with a man for 6 and a half years and married to him for 5 and a half years. The abuse came out after we got married. Then, the man who rescued me from my marriage abandoned me after my abortion.

My husband did a lot of things to me including call me names, shot me with his BB gun because he was annoyed at me, threatened to kill us by speeding in his car when he was angry at me, threaten our cat, ""jokingly"" put his hands around my neck and laughed when it made me uncomfortable, physically attacked his sister in front of me, threaten to quit his job just to get under my skin, spend a lot of our money that I was saving to buy a house to get ""a reaction out of me"", among many many other things. After I left him he told me there were times he wanted me to die so he could be happy again. I had moved to Canada to be with this man and was a thousand miles from my family, so I felt trapped. I had made a community of friends in Canada through roller derby, my career, and my running group and was starting to make a life there. But I had to up and leave all of that behind when my husband was at work one day because I knew that he may kill me or my cat one day. I actually told the VP and principal at the school I was teaching at about my situation and they were like ""We are not letting you stay with this man for one more day"". They helped me pack my stuff, book a flight home, and drive me to the airport. I took my cat with me. I had to leave behind our other two cats because I couldn't get them back home. He targeted the one cat because he knew I was bonded to him, he wasn't cruel to the other two cats. I was devastated. My ex husband is now super religious and has a super religious girlfriend. 

Well a month before I left, I reconnected with a friend that I had dated a decade ago. We had come to find out neither of us ever lost feelings for each other over the past decade despite having other partners. He had a 4 year and 2 and a half year relationship in which both ended because his girlfriends cheated on him. He helped me realize my abusive situation and get out. For some context to what happened with us, he is bipolar and unmedicated and not in therapy. We were together for 7 months. At the beginning of our relationship he was really intense and loving, but he told me about his bipolar and how he needed to slow things down as he could burn himself out with the intensity of the emotions so we slowed things down. He was excited about us finally getting to be together again as he lost hope because he thought I was happily married. We were seeing each other two to four times a week. He had brought up us moving in together and we had also talked about other future plans like our shared goal of moving out west together and having kids. His roommate offered us two rooms when we were about 5 months in, and he brought it up to me and I agreed. He did tell me about his paradoxical feelings like how we wanted to be with me and make things work but there was a nagging part of him that wanted to be single again too. He called it his ""hermit mode."" It was an issue with other partners but he mentioned because of how he feels about me he was trying to make it work with me. He had brought this up a few times.

Almost two weeks after we moved in together, I found out I was pregnant. We had a long discussion and agreed on an abortion, but he assured me he did want kids with me one day when we were both mentally, emotionally, and financially ready. And he had mentioned wanting kids with me a few times previously. We both had a shared goal of moving out west and talked about whether we would have kids before or after we moved out west. Well the day after my abortion he becomes distant. He said he wanted to go camping to be alone because he was stressing and wigging out about everything trying to come up with ""solutions"". I had a conversation about what was going on and he finally admitted he didn't actually want kids and was convincing himself he did to make me happy. It devastated me. After that he said he was feeling so overwhelmed and couldn't handle the relationship and was debating between leaving me or staying. He claimed he wanted to stay with me but needed to break up because he was feeling the urge to use again (he's a recovering addict) and run away from everyone and everything. He put it as his ""check engine light"" came on. He had talked to a bunch of people about this and an equal amount were telling him to stay and telling him to leave so he had as he called it ""options paralysis"". His one friend mentioned how he seemed to be doing better when he was single and he seemed more stressed in a relationship. He finally admitted that he wanted to want a future with me, but he needed to be single to discover what he wanted so we broke up. I found out my uncle died that same day, a week after my abortion, and I kind of freaked out at him and was like I can't handle this back and forth we'll just break up. We were living together so we were still living together a week after the break up until I moved out. He was icing me out and just being friendly but nothing more that week. It hurt so much. I was recovering emotionally from the abortion and really needed him, but he was treating me like a friend, leaving me hanging about whether or not he wanted to stay when that was the last thing I should've had to worry about.

The night before I moved out I was at my parents and he called me twice asking where I was, when I was coming home and updating me on things he could've texted me. The morning of my move out he was in a rush to get me out, and just pacing a lot. He said he was keeping busy to cope. He mentioned having hope we would be together again one day but was not expecting it and said he might not ever be ready to be in a relationship again. But he also said there was a potential for him to move back out to Seattle and we talked about maybe me joining him there but that ""we don't know what the future holds and anything is possible"". I texted him the Monday after my move out and he showed me everything he did with the room and seemed excited. I told him I missed him and he never responded. I haven't heard from him since last Monday aside from some Instagram reels he sent me. I'm just at such a loss about his change in feelings. How he could've loved me for a decade to this. How we were planning a future to him needing to be single to discover himself. He gave me a hug and told me ""take care of yourself"" and ""It'll be okay"" when we broke up. Like all of everything meant nothing. I really just feel abandoned, he is the one person I want to talk to who would understand me because it would've been his baby. I also feel abandoned by the man that was supposed to love me the most. My husband. I fell out of love with him a long time ago due to the abuse but I am hurt that he even abused me in the first place, that isn't love. He never loved me.

I am in therapy right now and realizing I need to be single. I feel like I am ending up with men who still need to heal themselves due to my fear of being alone and finding too much of my value in men. I don't want to break my own heart anymore.",2025-03-14 02:08:16,2025-03-17 02:11:50,all_new_posts

Doesn’t matter that I logically know I 1) was sexually coerced 2) revoked consent 3) tried to fight back 4) explicitly told him I felt violated - my brain is just so damn good at convincing me I’m just making it sound worse than what it was. I think it has to rationalize how I still stayed in contact with that person after the fact, until things escalated even further, until my life was even further in danger. He constantly belittled my boundaries. He wouldn’t let me leave. He physically held me down. He abused me in an endless multitude of ways because he’s an abusive f*cking person but hmmmmm maybe I’m just a drama queen.

1jashpw,My emotionally abusive ex and I “broke up” a few months ago but it turned into a “break” but we still talk. I feel guilty anytime a man wants to talk with me or shows any interest.,bengalbear24,2,2025-03-14 01:29:41+00:00,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jashpw/my_emotionally_abusive_ex_and_i_broke_up_a_few/,"Ended a long-term relationship with someone who I really loved deeply, but unfortunately had not managed to work out his mental health/emotional abuse issues throughout our 4-year relationship. We were engaged but I postponed the engagement and then broke things off because he wouldn’t stop his behaviors, try hard enough to change, or seek therapy, no matter how many times I begged him to.

He never hit me or physically abused me but he had a huge anger problem (he has trauma and impulse control issues and grew up with abusive parents) and would yell at me, call me horrific names (swear words, insults, name-calling), dump me, threaten to leave me or end the relationships dozens of times, give me the silent treatment, throw things around the house, kick stuff, punch/slam his fists, break random things, etc. It was really stressful and caused me immense anguish and I asked him so many times to treat me better, he would apologize and be better for awhile until doing it again after a few weeks or months.

I eventually reached my breaking point when his last episode (involving him acting aggressive and screaming/throwing things around the house, but not at me) caused me a nervous breakdown. I was in a fight or fight mode and basically couldn’t function for weeks.

We broke up, but he’s recently been making a big effort to work on his mental health and says he will do anything to change and better himself as a human. He says he recognized the error in his ways, the abuse cycle, how he abused me, and is finally actually doing the things I asked him to do all those years. He is meditating every day, going to therapy, and his overall mood and demeanor seems to be very different. He says that me standing up to him and not taking his BS anymore has given him a massive wake-up call about how destructive his behaviors and mental health have been to him and to everyone around him. He says he wants to change and be a better version of him, not just for me, but for himself. He seems generally less reactive, angry, and explosive. I really love the calm, sweet side of him - the kind, caring side that’s not so tormented by his own trauma and rage. I miss this side, it’s who I fell in love with.

So we are in a limbo state. We broke up, but we are talking, so not exactly together but not fully apart either. I’m considering giving him another chance in a few months or so if I am convinced that he’s actually taking the right steps. I miss and love him dearly but I am still very unsure. We have talked about how I’m unsure, and how neither of us are in a place to go on dates with or sleeping with other people right now.

The thing is, over the past couple of months, about 3-4 men have hit on me/seemed to possibly express some level of interest in me (which hasn’t happened in years; I swear somehow men can sense if you’re not in a committed relationship!). One was an old friend from high school who ran into me, another was at a pizza place, and a coffee shop. I told my high school friend (we chatted for a bit and I couldn’t tell if he was flirting with me) that I’m open to friendship but not emotionally available to date (because of my complicated relationship situation). 

When a random guy around my age struck up a conversation with me at the coffee shop, I was friendly and chatted. I was not flirtatious, just nice and friendly as I would be to anyone talking to me, and had no idea if it was inappropriate of me to be talking with him. We didn’t talk about dating or anything inappropriate, just talked about the area, how there aren’t many people our age here (most people are much older than me and it can get lonely!), jobs, etc. I enjoyed talking with him but also felt so guilty about it. Was I leading him on? Being disloyal to my ex, who I have a complicated relationship with? I didn’t tell him about my complicated relationship status because it didn’t come up and it would have felt very awkward to mention it. He asked for my number to stay in touch and since we were having a friendly chat I gave it to him, as I have to other friends I’ve met (I recently connected with a couple of women and gave them my number too). 

I can’t help but feel like I did something wrong and I feel so confused and icky about all of this. If the coffee shop guy asks me out on a date I’ll just tell him that he seems like a genuinely cool person and I appreciate connecting as friends but I’m ending a complicated long-term relationship and not emotionally available to date right now. Was it wrong for me to talk with him? Should I have ignored him when he was friendly and approached me to say hi? Told him immediately that I have a boyfriend/partner (even tho I don’t)? Should I have refused to give him my number when he asked (I was conflicted but didn’t want to be rude to someone who was friendly)? All the work I do is virtual and I often feel so isolated and lonely these days, it’s nice having people be friendly to me. I would have also been thrilled if a woman my age approached me and gave me her number to stay in touch as friends.

1jaqnje,"Don't feel like a human being anymore, more like an animal",SituationOk8888,7,2025-03-13 23:58:52+00:00,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jaqnje/dont_feel_like_a_human_being_anymore_more_like_an/,"I don't feel like a human being anymore. I know humans are animals, but I mean I really really don't see the difference anymore, and not in a good way. It feels bad.

Society and community don't feel real to me anymore, because they screwed me over during the abusive relationship. Those systems victim-blamed me, abandoned me and showed me cruelty.

Plus some of my abusive relationship was during covid. Plus there is geo-political uncertainty. Plus my doctor is unusable for me because she is a bad doctor. There are no other doctors.

So in my mind, if the abuse shelters are unsafe or not functioning, and the people in society are dangerous, and medical care isn't very accessible, and family is dangerous and estranged, and people no longer text or call each other or do things and hang out in real life and everyone cancels everything all the time and people are constantly sick and depressed, IS THERE A SOCIETY? Is there a community?

If I never talk to anyone and barely look at anyone, am I a human? If I am always afraid for my survival and I cannot rely on anyone for help and I hide in my apartment when I don't have to be in the world, then I am just an animal in my den. I act accordingly.

My apartment reflects that too. Over time it has begun to look insane in here. It looks like how I feel. I covered over all the windows one at a time. I emptied two of the rooms and put everything into the livingroom and I sleep on the floor in a nest. I leave trash everywhere because I feel like my life has been desecrated. I deep clean it every month so there isn't a sanitation concern, but it doesn't feel right here unless it's a disgusting cage where an abused animal would live. I want to feel like I'm in my own coffin. That's the only thing that feels right.

If it were the other way around and I was the one who abused him i just know that they would all be throwing parties to help him feel better.

I know that people might say ""well are they really your friends?"" But i really can blame myself because I told them that I don't want them to hate him, and that I hope they'll stay friends with him. In the moment it felt like the right thing to do, but now I wish I could take it back. I wish they hadn't listened. I'm not gonna go on a hate campaign against him, but I am hurt. 

Once my friends literally held a party cause one of our friends got broken up with, and I just wish they would consider doing something like that for me. I feel like I have to reach out to all my friends and no one is reaching out to me. Maybe I could use some more friends, but I'd feel bad starting a friendship in my current state. I wish the ones I already had would be more here for me.

Also it is heavy. I hope the music comes through because it matches very well. Very abrupt shifts much like what I go through during these.

There are lots of details one could mis on the first watch so keep an eye out. It is meant to go under the radar at first though. Then when you notice.. it’s startling.. and then it takes a while and you notice more has happened. 

Now… don’t say I should leave.. I have no where to go as a disabled person who has been to an ableist shelter before.. my partner mostly does take care of my disability stuff in ways I couldn’t expect of anyone. I have no close friends with space. I have no family. Plus my shared custody with my already ex is difficult enough without destabilizing my housing a second time. He is playing nice because he respects my current partner. That ex.. well he was actually worse and scared me more. So I would rather not face him alone again. 

So… for the meantime. This is what it is for me. Partner is trying to do recovery and I can see the work. Doesn’t make it any easier.. but a little hope that I won’t run completely out of any somewhat viable option. 

But ya if I was healthy and didn’t have to worry about custody I would have dozens of options available. Lastly. Presently safe and doing ok. Good enough to actually make what I have been slowly working on for around a year now.

Well I’m finally divorcing him. Here is a list of some crazy shit that has happened/ I have found out about him since separating. 

He was not helping me with putting the kids to sleep, I turned the lights on in the apartment and told him I was going to go somewhere where I would get help. He got very upset with this. He told me that he had lost feelings for me a month ago. He also made me take my wedding ring off and told me that I don’t deserve it. I told him that this is why his past relationships have not worked out, even with his own family. 


He did not say goodbye to my sister (everyone else was and it was inappropriate and rude not to say goodbye) after she left our son’s birthday party because she did not get our son a gift. He proceeded to tell me after that I was not to drive my car with my  sister and my cousin so that we could all get our nails done together. He said that if he found out that I did we were going to have problems. He said he can have a say because he does the maintenance on the car and helps pay for it occasionally. This made me feel like I don’t have a say at all in what I do or who I can have in my own car. 


I asked him to try to keep our daughter quiet while I was putting our son to sleep. He got up and turned the lights on and tried to kick me out of the apartment with our two kids to go and stay at my moms. He said I was always bitching about something. I was trying to ask him for help with putting our children to sleep. I was respectful and kind when asking him to keep her quiet. 


Told me I was worthless for not giving our daughter medicine before bed (she absolutely hates it) and told me he never wants to see me again 

Told me to go back to being a “ho” since that’s what I was. 

Called me trash. 

Told me I didn’t deserve to wear my wedding ring/band. 

Found out the has been evicted twice. 

Found out there was a DV charge in his past. 

Found out he was married another time I didn’t know about. 

……yeah I’m fucking glad I’m getting out of this shit. ",2025-03-13 21:57:02,2025-03-17 02:12:03,all_new_posts
1janqn1,I don’t know if I’m the abused or the abuser,Mysterious-World4805,5,2025-03-13 21:47:56+00:00,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1janqn1/i_dont_know_if_im_the_abused_or_the_abuser/,"I was diagnosed with pmdd in my twenties for depression before menses. I never took any medicine until about a year ago. Little less. Anyways i lost insurance and haven’t had it for months now. It’s gotten more intense, the pmdd, since being with my husband (8 years). 

First altercstion was me punching walls when i found out he slept with his ex wife. At this point we were living together and i had a pmdd episode where i told him that i was moving back to my home country and sent him pictures of a girl kissing me and a Snapchat of his friend with us. I know this sounds fucking awful when i write this shit down but ya that’s all i did, nothing more and i did it to hurt him and there’s no excuse. I was angry because he was visiting his daughter and his ex wife was staying with him at his dads house and i thought it was inappropriate behavior and he said i was crazy and ya.  The cycle. And he thinks i deserved him to cheat because of my behavior. But anyways when i found out he cheated i pushed him and punched walls all over our apartment and broke my hand. When to the er and everything. 

Second altercation he grabbed me because i was drunk and not keeping quiet when cops were called to a friends house for loud music. He told me to go in the back and i said no and he grabbed my arm and i punched him and tried to punch again and he then punched me several times in the head until i stopped. 

I have called him screaming over trivial things, mostly surrounding feeling like something he did was inappropriate. It always starts as me trying to express how I’m feeling calmly, him calling me crazy and then me calling him an asshole and then him calling me dumb and then me calling him a piece of shit. That’s the cycle. I could be making excuses but i generally feel unheard. 

(For context:At some point between these instances he choked me for being dismissive and saying i was done with the argument)

I’ve kicked him out because he was hanging out with his brother (scammer, gang member and he’s also younger) but it wasn’t his intention, he was staying at his dads for a business convention and his brother came to hang out.  He lied and i heard his brother in the background. I was pissed and Put his clothes and belongings in suitcases at the door etc and then when he tried to leave i begged him to stay. This is definitely abusive behavior on my part. He didn’t hit me he just yelled at me and at my sister who was trying to call him down. But obviously i was the instigator. 

I’ve gotten angry over being uninvited on a beach trip and he went anyway. I stayed calm and tried to not make a huge deal but then he stayed later… and i felt like he was doing too much considering he didn’t feel offended by me being uninvited. Mind you it was just a male coworker who didn’t know me that invited us as a couple then said only one, him, could go. Idk this does sound pretty bad on my part but i called him and told him he better get home right now. He was staying a couple hours later to sleep before the drive back. I regret having done that and feel like i overreacted but if that happened 8 years into our relationship, my husband wouldn’t have gone anyways because he typically would be offended by anything like that towards me from others. If that makes sense. 

All this in the first 2 years. 
Everything after that has been physical abuse from him and emotional abuse possibly both ways. 

He went through a dark time last year where he was chasing me around the house yelling and screaming at me quit his job out is in debt etc and i stayed and tried my best to be a caretaker because, i won’t go into the details because it’s just too much but the justice system failed his daughter and it was devastating for our entire community, not just him. 

Anyways there was physical abuse during that time (pushing snd shaking) and really terrible verbal abuse. I believe he has ied and depression and bipolar and he’s on medication as of the end of last year.  

Since we sold our house he has choked me twice. 

Once because i got an attitude when he was trying to tell me he felt upset they i stayed up without him on telegram being and admin not even doing anything fun. So because of my attitude he called me a piece of shit and choked me. 

This last time (yesterday) i was upset with him and he’s saying I’m blaming him for other people actions and being angry with him for other people’s actions because i told him i don’t know if i wanna live here anymore because the people he hangs out with the most are vulgar and he knew i didn’t want that. This is also right after he dropped our religion  and didn’t want to hold onto any of the day to day things we integrated into our parenting and marriage through it even though they were good things like not drinking, cursing, smoking. He started doing all 3. He has been trying hard in his opinion not to get involved with anything like that and other peoples behavior isn’t in  his control. I told him i didn’t want to talk anymore and he changed the subject to an insult about me not hearing what he had said before the conversation. That triggered me because if an argument isnt going his way he will start insulting and just being mean, especially if his feelings are hurt. So i started driving him to work and we kept fussing and rather then taking him to work i kept making U-turns and going back in forth in front of his job. Coworkers saw our car going back and forth. He said to let him out and i said no. He kept screaming at me calling me crazy and telling me to stop the car. I finally let him out and then drove off and text him saying he was going to lose his job today then i  called him and told him he better get back in the car right now. He got back in and sat quietly i ranted at him and when i got to the part about him not taking action and setting boundaries he yelled that he gets no credit when he tried to change the conversation topic 3 times. He said let him out, i said no.  he choked me i said no he put his hands on the steering and jammed his foot down into the pedals. Turned the steering left and right jerking the car and out it in neutral and punched me in the face. I pulled over then and let him out and called the police for the first time. Got out of the car and 2 coworkers pulled up and he told one i was holding him hostage so i yelled out that he punched me. I could hear what he said when the other pulled up. I told the cops never mind i don’t want to press charges and they picked him up while he was walking anyway. I told him i cancelled it and he said he wanted to make his report and the cop wants me there. So i went back. I don’t Know what he told the cop but i told the cop that i didn’t want to press charges and he said that he was going to make a report and not arrest him. Gave us a long talk about working it out for our kids etc. 

Today he told me im to blame and my brain is scrambled eggs but im feeling like im to blame now and full of remorse and i get there’s no excuse for domestic violence but i  clearly take it way too far someone please look at this with fresh eyes. I could’ve just stopped the car now he may lose his job and this was our last chance at community and a good life. He just yelled at me and said basically I’m sick and he can’t believe i think he’s at fault…",2025-03-13 21:47:56,2025-03-17 02:12:04,all_new_posts

I fled one night as he has issues with drugs and alcohol and it was becoming a severe issue in our relationship ( on top of everything else). Due to this I have suspended contact until we go to court for child arrangements. We are both 22. I just wondered if anyone else has been in a similar situation and if the partner eventually lost interest. I don’t think it’s going to look good in court as he’s been arrested and is being investigated for some pretty serious stuff he did to me, he has a history of drug and alcohol abuse (and current problem) and I have an NMO against him. He has little interest in the child when we were together and I don’t believe he truly loves her. I suppose I’m wondering a) what kind of access will a court allow with all this stuff taken into consideration b) will his interest wane when his rage passes and he realises he no longer has control over me.

1janb72,Can't seem to leave,Longjumping_Sky_4199,2,2025-03-13 21:29:34+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1janb72/cant_seem_to_leave/,"I need help. My gf (F29) and I (M36) have been in a relationship for almost six years. She is Korean and grew up quite rich while I'm Portuguese from a very regular middle-class background. Her upbringing, by her own account, was difficult because her parents apparently routinely preferred her two brothers over her, and she dealt with a lot of rejection, anxiety, fear of abandonment and other issues as a young kid. She said her mom generally treated her very poorly - very little to no love, no praise, calling her ugly and shaming her in front of friends and relatives - but then in she'd be ""made whole"" through gifts and money. My upbringing, by contrast, was calm, loving and not marred by any particular difficulty.

After about a year or so into dating she started to get extremely upset (yell, throw/break things, say really mean and hurtful things, take my things away, prevent me from leaving my room/apartment, even through up from anger and crying etc.) over perceived slights such as not texting her back fast enough or occasionally having to wait for me (for as little as 3-5 minutes, virtually never more than 10) due to work or similar obligations. She also regularly accused me of cheating which I've never done. She absolutely hated it every time I did anything on my own or just with my friends instead of her. She also started purposefully and noisily interrupting work calls if they ever intruded on ""our"" time, which caused a lot of embarrassment to me. Talking to her about these issues usually resulted in her pointing out that I'm ""making her"" do these things because of my behavior, and that I'm really the problem.

Despite all these issues (just scratching the surface) I stayed with her all these years because I'm in love with the sweet side of her, when things are calm and we are loving with each other. I find her immensely attractive (physically and emotionally) in those moments and I keep coming back like an addict to get more of those moments - the ""highs"" of our relationship. In those moments I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. However, I'm continually blindsided by at least weekly outbursts that completely throw me off balance and are unbelievably hurtful. We've tried several couples' therapists to no avail; we just kept going in circles rehashing fights and her noting that her trauma takes over during them.

Additionally, she often dangled a carrot in front of me - if I pay more for her (because money is important to her from her upbringing), then she'll be nicer. If I spend more time with her (because quality time is important to her), then she'll be nicer and let me do my things when I want to, etc. -- and she also tells me regularly that ""other guys"" and her exes would do all those things in an instant, and I'm the odd one out what doesn't. I've done all that and moved the goalposts over and over again (now paying for 90% of her life, neglecting my interests, etc.) but there hasn't been meaningful improvement resulting from my appeasement.

More recently, whatever remaining respect there was between us during our fights has been thrown out of the window. I've essentially cowered on a couch for over an hour, listening to the meanest things she could come up with (including that I'm a loser, I'm gay, nobody likes me, she hates me and doesn't love me, I treat her badly, etc.). She also escalated being physically destructive and yelling at me at the top of her lungs right next to my ears to the point that my ears were ringing for hours afterwards. She's dragged bedding away from me when I was trying to sleep and shone her phone's flashlight into my face trying to keep me up because she was upset that I had to do some late work while we were traveling.

And yet, I still come back the next day forgiving everything just to stay with her. I put all the bad things away and hope that there's some path for our relationship to just be loving and that we'll have a happy ending together, growing old together. I'm so off-balance that I rationally know that I'm a good person yet her continually telling me that I'm the bad guy here causing all of her behavior has eaten away at me that it keeps me wondering - am I the problem after all? I'm scared of starting over and I'm scared that I might regret walking away from this even though all the evidence points to things just continuing to get worse. I feel like I'm in jail, scared of really acknowledging what's going on and scared of a future after all these years where I've tried so hard to make it work. I'm also beyond exhausted and sad.",2025-03-13 21:29:34,2025-03-17 02:12:07,all_new_posts

We don’t live together but I live with someone he’s close to, the rent is affordable rn and I was in a toxic situation at my last apartment before living here. 

I can’t move just yet, I don’t make enough to get a place on my own and I’m terrified of moving into a place with narcissistic roommates and landlord again. 

I’ve got somewhat of a plan, but I’m worried about keeping things calm/steady, until I am able to leave and just cut him off 100% all at once. 

I don’t care for him anymore, yet at the same time I still do? It’s confusing and frustrating. Part of me wants to try to end things amicably, but from what I’ve been reading, it’s probably best not to say anything and just leave. In the past when arguing and maybe once when we weren’t fighting, he said he think things would be amicable between us and he’d still wanna be friends if we split. I used to believe that, but now idk, I want too, but I’m scared to put any more trust into him. 

I also have some stuff of his, and things like pictures and gifts I need to give him/leave for him. (Some things I don’t want, he’ll definitely be angry if I keep some things, and there’s things we’ve used together that I can’t reuse with someone else((if I ever date again)).

I know it’s stupid, but I’m worried about how his friends and family might see me afterwards. What he’ll tell them is the reason for breaking up. Or if I just disappear. 

I don’t have friends that are reliable, so that’s not an option. Some family lives far away, and could be an option, but they might not be by the time I’m able to get out. 

I tried looking up places/organizations in my state, but I got too overwhelmed, and I didn’t get far. And I’m scared how that might affect me? Idk how to explain it, it doesn’t make sense. ",2025-03-13 21:11:30,2025-03-17 02:12:08,all_new_posts

Recently hes gotten more aggressive and annoyed with me, everytime i do something or ask him for some kind of reassurance, or even ask him what hes doing, he always gets annoyed with me and often snaps at me. He doesnt see the problem, even if i sometimes mention it to him, and i feel like its ruining our relationship. At the beginning of our relationship he was really loving and wasnt getting annoyed at me ever, but he did have a small problem with communicating, but now he doesnt communicate with me ever, even if i try talking to him about stuff and about what did i do wrong, he never talks to me about it but he expects me to change. I always explain to him that i cant possibly change, and i take my time to try to get him to talk to me about his feelings, but he never opens up to me about my wrong doings. Recently he started getting mad at me for just asking him too many questions, which i told him i need to know some stuff because he never tells me anything anymore, in which he said he doesnt care and to just stop asking him anything. How do i talk to him about my feelings without making him annoyed? When we are having normal conversations hes acting normal, but when i start talking about my feelings he gets mad and often leaves me and wont answer me. How do i tell him that him getting annoyed at me all the time has a massive impact on our relationship without him telling me im ""pulling a victim card""?
Id like to mention that i have BPD that ive been working on, and he has autism. Our relationship is long distance, and we have never met.

My dad never missed an opportunity to say, you make a mistake and pay for it, for 18 years, stuff like that. Birthdays & holidays you would pick and choose if he would acknowledge me or not. When my dad passed away my mother blamed me. She told me her husband is dead because I did not go to where he was and take care of him. 

Then at 16 I met my now husband of 30 years. Once I turned 40 I realized I traded one man’s abuse for another’s. He is real good at forgetting my birthdays or Xmas.

I recently had a boob job, and I look great! I absolutely loved the results and obviously feel more confident about wearing clothes that didnt fit me as well before.. I am engaged and had some fights with my fiancé, I’ve never cheated or disrespected him, we live together and spend a lot of time together. He has been acting weird since the boob job, I was so happy that he would enjoy the enhancement and asked him to buy me lingerie bc he loves it and I feel way more confident now. So yesterday I did some shopping and bought some dresses that show cleavage, I am thin and tall and they look great, not like kardashian style or stuff like that.. However he called me a hoe, said he wouldnt want the mother of his children to dress like one nor marry one.. also he is a hypocrite bc he looks for girls in OF and I didnt use to care.. but now I think.. why is it ok when he does that but I cant dress a bit sexy?

He is giving me some macho vibes and after he said those things I blocked him and wouldnt come back to our apartment, I am with my family.

I also forgot to mention he said that my father and brother would be ashamed of me bc of how I looked.. so I asked them just for curiosity and they both said I look great! They even encouraged me to wear these. Just to give you some context..

I am seriously offended. What do you guys think?",2025-03-13 19:01:20,2025-03-17 02:12:12,all_new_posts

I had to leave my best friend because their partner emotionally abused and manipulated me. For almost a year I thought I was crazy for suspecting it but the more I dug the more my suspicions were validated. 

She had a history of emotionally abusing friends, I reached out to a former friend group of hers and was told a nearly identical series of events to my own experience. I reached out to current friends and they said they weren't surprised by this behavior and that she seemed like the type.

Yet when I told my best friend all of this they did nothing. They are continuing to be with someone who hurt me so badly I wanted to end my life. They made me think that something was wrong with me. That I was broken. That I was worthless. That I deserved to be treated like trash. To say that I am disappointed by their decision was to stay is an understatement.

For my own peace, leaving was the right choice, but I'm so devastated by this loss. They told me they would think about it, but it felt like they made their decision before I even finished talking to them. I miss them so much.",2025-03-13 18:20:47,2025-03-17 02:12:13,all_new_posts
1jaijlr,Migraine and feeling of lost post break up,Same_Distance2328,1,2025-03-13 18:09:44+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jaijlr/migraine_and_feeling_of_lost_post_break_up/,"June 2024 – I was on a work assignment in Turkey when I met K, a Kurdish guy. We spent eight days together, and things quickly clicked between us.

After returning to India, he kept pressuring me to commit for a month. However, I kept saying no because I was still in the process of ending things with someone else and had multiple reservations about K. I sensed he had anger issues and was trying to control my life unnecessarily. I wanted to take some time for myself to fully move on from the first guy, avoiding any overlap, but K insisted I stay with him while ending things with the other person. I explained that I couldn’t cut ties abruptly because we had mutual friends and I wanted to part on good terms.

His response? He threatened to expose our relationship at my workplace unless I ended things with the other guy immediately. Given the unsaid rules of my job, this could have cost me my position. Panicked, I did what he demanded. Later, he denied ever making such a threat.

The next four months were a nightmare.
	•	He forced me to tell my parents about him just three months into dating.
	•	He pressured me to quit my job and find a remote one so that I could move to Turkey.
	•	He slut-shamed me for having male friends.
	•	If I complimented even a female friend, he’d accuse me of sleeping with her.
	•	He justified hurting me by saying it was out of “love and care.”
	•	He constantly monitored my whereabouts, demanding to know where I was at all times. If I went out with friends, regardless of gender, without telling him, he would make my life hell.
	•	He controlled my finances, questioning how I spent money on my friends and family and telling me I shouldn’t help them.
	•	He reduced me to a lifeless, crying wreck. I cried almost every night. He would yell at me any time, for anything.

The breaking point came when I spent New Year’s with him and his family.
	•	My flight was delayed by four hours, making my total journey nearly 12 hours long. He decorated the hotel room with lights and balloons, which I appreciated with enthusiasm and kisses. But because I was exhausted, my “tired voice” wasn’t enough for him. I crashed immediately after arriving.
	•	The next day, he kept me hungry until 3 PM (which was even later in my time zone).
	•	That night, he accused me of being “incompetent at loving him” and insisted that I text him every hour if I was out—even though my stance was simple: If I know you’re at a party, isn’t it obvious that you’ll be busy for a few hours? Why do I need to keep proving I care?
	•	We got drunk on an empty stomach and passed out—meaning no sex that night. We had already been intimate that morning, but apparently, that wasn’t enough.

The next morning, he scolded me for not having enough sex with him and continued berating me over trivial misunderstandings, even when I agreed with him. During a four-hour train ride, he insulted and degraded me non-stop until I broke down crying. I was completely drained when we arrived at his home, where his mother also lived.

One evening, my ex called to offer a final apology. Since I had nothing to hide, I picked up. K exploded with rage and demanded that I leave his home immediately. As I sat on the floor packing my bag, he dragged me onto the bed and forced me to endure another round of his slut-shaming.

The worst part? The sex.
	•	He was obsessed with it, constantly pushing for intimacy in inappropriate places.
	•	His idea of sex involved only two things: I had to ride him, and I had to perform oral on him.
	•	If I asked for a change, he would do it half-heartedly for a few seconds before going back to what he wanted.
	•	He pressured me daily for phone sex, and if I agreed, he’d call me a slut.
	•	He called me a slut during sex, slapped me, and ignored me when I repeatedly told him I didn’t like it.

I finally broke up with him, realizing it was for the best. But even after that, he kept trying to manipulate me. When I finally told him why I hated sex with him, he lashed out and cut all ties, calling me an “ugly bitch” who only wanted to hurt him.


Now, I am left with migraine and no life. I can't get out of bed in morning just wants days to pass. I know I have been wrong at some places but I still don't believe my suffering can be justified. Help me to move on.",2025-03-13 18:09:44,2025-03-17 02:12:14,all_new_posts

1jai2iw,Run of the mill abuse and running my life,Legitimate-Clue-102,2,2025-03-13 17:50:06+00:00,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jai2iw/run_of_the_mill_abuse_and_running_my_life/,"Husband was on a work trip. I've been trying to make appointments for one of our infants (had twins recently) so she can get a helmet. I find out from the specialist that our insurance says it's going to expire so they may not be able to take our case. I know nothing about this so I call the insurance company. They inform me that my husband doesn't have me listed as someone privy to policy information. They offer to three-way call his HR company to ask about the policy expiration. They also tell me I'm not listed as someone privy to the information.

At this point it looks like he has forgotten to renew the insurance (probably not because employer insurance usually auto-renews), or has taken me and our 3 kids off of his insurance in another destructive fit of rage. I then have to call him, and I'm crying, because, people cry, and that's ok. I'm not hysterical - just crying. I explain the situation without telling him my suspicions about his actions, and he immediately screams at me. Why does he scream? Not because of what I found out - but because I'm crying. He hates crying. He has, in the past, even gone so far as to tell me to shut up when I'm crying, and stomped on the 2nd floor ceiling when our daughter cried during a bath. He tells me it's my fault I let the insurance lapse because I didn't give him our daughters' social security numbers (I handed them to him and watched him enter the information). I told him that I don't work for his company, so how can I sign us up for anything? Still my fault and I should call his employer. I rolled my eyes into next year. He's clearly got a guilty conscience about his actions.

I tell him I'm going to get off the phone (I always quickly end calls when he starts screaming - - there's no point in talking after that). He then starts texting me horrible things, so I block him. I can see he is texting how dare I block him, I'm a c-word, and that blocking him is abusive. I'm a bad mom and I made him lose his last job and prevent him from getting ahead all the time (he legit threw and broke work equipment in front of all his coworkers and got fired).

I called a bunch of hotlines to calm myself down because the drama led to a panic attack. He's like this every day. Multiple people have told him he's abusing me and he just does not care and tells them they're wrong. My counselor tries to make the excuse that he needs to be evaluated for Bipolar, and I have decided there is no more excusing his actions.

He apologizes in a text at the end of his rant with a ""sorry"". I didn't reply or anything. I'm beyond done. I don't want him thinking he has control over me, but of course, he then doubled-down and ignored me back. He didn't even tell me what time he'd be home from the work trip yesterday. He then did what he always does and waited to come home until after I was asleep (1am or so). I woke up to feed our twins around 3 am and he was in the office playing video games. That's all he cares about.

The next morning he, of course, acts like nothing happened. I had to continue to try to get information from him about the insurance so I could call and make appointments. He was full-on rolling his eyes when I told him he had to call them. I cannot believe a person like this exists.

Please, no, ""get out, it will only get worse"", ""leave"", ""or ""I allow it by being here"" ""you're not trapped"" comments. I'm looking for community and I won't be quieted.",2025-03-13 17:50:06,2025-03-17 02:12:16,all_new_posts

1jag2bc,Coming to terms with my sexual abuse trauma,Informal_Dark_7685,3,2025-03-13 16:28:23+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jag2bc/coming_to_terms_with_my_sexual_abuse_trauma/,"I grew up in a hoarder house, with parents who were always fighting. And at the time I thought that these would be the largest hurdles for me to overcome as a I got older. However, something I didn’t recognize as sexual trauma until quite recently, has seemed to take the front seat. 

Due to living conditions (no electricty, no heat, etc.) there were periods of time throughout my adolescence and childhood where I would need to sleep in my parents room. Oftentimes during these sleepovers in my parents room, I would struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep due to my parents being intimate not even a few feet from me. (I often slept on a couch that was at the foot of their bed). I would always think back then that it was just a product of my living situation and it was normal for parents to do this with their kid in the room. That they likely forgot I was even there. 

WILD 🙃 I know. Now as an adult, I realize that I can’t even have intimacy without realizing my dog / cat within the room. So there’s no way that my parents were doing this so frequently, without having any thought regarding their child sleeping at the foot of their bed. I now know that even though I did not experience the sexual trauma firsthand from my father, it still provided its own lasting imprint on how i can engage sexually. 

During college, while coming to terms with a lot of my trauma, my mother finally seemed like she might want to leave my dad. (She met someone online, it turned out it was some catfish… which i actually felt bad for because I desperately wanted my mom to escape the DV from my father). At this time, she had confided to me that my father often raped her throughout their marriage. 

In that moment, my understanding of my childhood sexual abuse changed. I was not longer experiencing witnessing my parents have sex, but witnessing my father often rape my mother. As it was clear to me at the time that she did not want to engage in intimacy with me sleeping so close. Looking back now I realized how often I was an innocent bystander to my mother being raped.

My mother unfortunately has never left my father, and has stuck by him throughout my healing journey. Aside from this, there’s so many other reasons that I’ve become no - contact with my parents. But this situation is the one I wish I could get an explanation for the most.

As an adult I now accept that this was sexual abuse, and I can claim that for myself. I find peace in knowing if I ever have children, this is not something I would accept as normal. I just only wish I realized earlier, and deeply wish that realizing this wouldn’t completely alter my relationship to sex.

Im writing this to see if anyone else experienced similar abuse and the additional experience of not realizing it until way later in life.",2025-03-13 16:28:23,2025-03-17 02:12:20,all_new_posts

And then I'm afraid of giving into to talking to him and feeling compelled to give him a chance??

Someone I once loved so deeply became my worst nightmare, turning my world into a living hell. I never imagined I could love someone so much that I would completely lose myself. When I walked away, I didn’t even know where to begin. Now, I feel like I’ve lived three different lives—the person I was before him, the person I became with him, and now, the person trying to piece herself back together. But I don’t remember who I used to be.

Some days, it feels like I’m moving forward. Other days, like today, the weight of it all crashes down on me. Maybe it’s because his birthday just passed.

I understand that with abusive relationships some people tend to go back multiple times in hopes of change or familiarity.

However, one thing that makes me question is do the individual actually want to go back or are they only going back to the abuser to avoid future trouble?

The guy I was talking to keeps going back to his abuser. This would probably be his 5th time I would say—but my second time giving him a chance.

He told me how toxic things were, his friends even told him, etc. Yet, he went back again. 

We got into a real intense argument this time because he called me a c-word and told me we only talked because they weren’t together. 

I’m convinced that he doesn’t truly feel that way with how his vulnerability began to show when he kept saying he was sorry for not telling me about her.

I think that he only told me those things because he probably wanted to show her that he doesn’t care about me to avoid abuse on his end.

She didn’t cook or clean, and intimacy was nonexistent. My job was to provide, to work all day, then come home and take care of her and the apartment. Every failure of mine was a moment of satisfaction for her; every success, dismissed. She once told me outright, ""I will never compliment you because I don't want it to go to your head.""
To the outside world, she put on a perfect act, but that level of pretense was exhausting. If things didn’t go her way, I was the one who paid for it. She was, without a doubt, the most selfish person I’ve ever known.
People change. Words leave scars. Anything given freely is taken for granted. Go above and beyond once, and that becomes the new expectation—never appreciated, never acknowledged. Promises made in love become weapons in conflict. No matter how much you give, you’re always doing something wrong, and she’ll be sure to remind you at every opportunity. The deepest fears and insecurities you trusted her with become ammunition when she decides you need to be put in your place.
She claimed she didn’t mean the things she said in anger, but she did—every single word. If you’re always the one initiating affection, stop and see what happens. Chances are, nothing will change—until the next fight, when she’ll accuse you of not being affectionate anymore. The friends you thought were yours as a couple?

For some background, I have been with my partner for 6 months. I tried to break up with him somewhat recently, but came back. I will list what led up to my decision.

• When a friend of mine criticized him and it made me have some slight doubts, he made up a false accusation towards her, made transphobic comments about her, then said that if I did not cut things off with her he would physically harm her. (When I tried to call him out after getting back together for doing something so horrible, he said that maybe it was ‘wrong’ but that ‘horrible’ is an exaggeration)

• He said I can’t hang up a tapestry or get a tattoo for a male deity I worship out of jealousy, he said it seemed like I was “fangirling”. (He still gets angry if I mention said deity)

• He would always come up with any tiny criticism about anyone in my support system who didn’t absolutely love him and would use it as an excuse for me to cut them off. He also made a ‘rule’ that anytime him and I were going through something I couldn’t talk about it with anyone else but him. (His suspicion has intensified since getting back together because it was a friend that made me realize how bad things were)

• He banned me from listening to kpop in the car or going to kpop concerts because he would get upset about the men. (He has now lifted that ban but was quite unhappy about it)

• He often ‘teases’ me and makes jokes towards me, but when I try to do the same he often gets upset. There was even one time he kept throwing sexist jokes at me and when I got angry he used my outburst against me.

• He attempted to beat up a teenager when said teenager tried to ask for my number, and refused to stop when I tried to pull him away. No one actually got hurt but it was to the point that security got involved. (He said after this event he realized he no longer wants to act like that and desires to change. It is true he has not attempted or threatened any physical harm since, but has said he still feels desires to)

• He regularly treated me like a therapist, even once saying “I don’t need a therapist, I have you.” (He later claimed this was a joke)

• He said I could only go to a couple certain places by myself that I know no man will bother or hit on me. He also said I couldn’t go out in very revealing clothing unless I’m out with him. (He has doubled down to saying I can’t wear revealing clothes in general)

• He has yelled at and hit his dog. He did ease on it after I called him out for it, but idk about when I’m not around.

• After I broke up with him then reached back out, he told me I was vile, cruel and shitty and berated me for a few days straight. He said that in my goodbye message I was ‘vicious’, even though I said “I love you” like 20 times and every person I have showed it to said it was rather gentle. Yes, I blocked him after, but it was because my friend told me he was potentially dangerous.


He claims me trying to leave him has traumatized him, and that his anger and behavior that led to me breaking up with him was rooted in him being mistreated by society and past trauma, so it was unfair of me to give up on him. 

He said that if I want to relationship to work I would have to put my all into being the best ‘wife’ I can be and to practice more initiative. As you can imagine his definition of a ‘good wife’ is quite traditional, and he wants me to fully adjust to his culture. I have been cooking for him, almost completely taken over taking care of his dog, cleaning, etc. With this plus adjusting to a new medication, I’ve been exhausted. The only solace I’ve had is going to the park by myself an hour a day to engage in joyful movement. 

However, today he sat me down and said he’s been disappointed in how I haven’t been doing enough things with him that he enjoys, and that me taking time for myself at the park everyday was getting in the way and making me too tired to do more things he liked with him. Out of exasperation I started crying and said that I felt like I’ll never be enough, and he said he’s the one that should be feeling that way because of the message I sent him when I broke up with him. Also he made me stay up until 1am until he felt like he was done venting and anytime I would say that I was tired he would say “didn’t you say you’d do anything for me?”

I’m feeling so exhausted, idk what to do. Should I feel bad? Am I overreacting? All my friends say he’s toxic and potentially dangerous, but he’s very good at convincing me that I’m the toxic one.",2025-03-13 13:51:48,2025-03-17 02:12:34,all_new_posts
1jabn9s,You deserve more.,No-Guidance-2399,15,2025-03-13 13:13:09+00:00,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jabn9s/you_deserve_more/,"Hi everyone,

I just want to share solitude and love to everyone that’s either healing after leaving, contemplating how to escape, and those that are unfortunately just experiencing the horrific behavior of our abusers. You matter, this is not your fault, and you absolutely are worthy of safety. Abuse can make us feel less than, because an abusive person’s low self-esteem encourages them to hurt us. Even though it may be difficult, I want you to know for a solid fact, you DO deserve more and you’re sooooo special. You light up the room when you walk in, you make someone happy that you’re alive, and there are people wishing for a you. 

What I’ve come to understand is that these abusers really hate themselves and their lives, so they try to reconcile that by being horrible to others. They believe this false sense of superiority and it’s just making them worse off. Even if you’re standing up for yourself, that’s still not a reason for you to be abused. I don’t care what they try to tell you. I still battle with the guilt of leaving people I really loved, but I’d rather be safe and offered genuine love than fearing the next form of abuse. I’m not saying you won’t be scared after escaping, but at least you have the certainty of yourself and no one attacking you every chance they get. These people are not on the same emotional and mental level as us, whereas we try to do good in the world and work on ourselves.

I used to cry because the person I loved so deeply kept actively choosing to tear me down and abuse me, despite me begging, presenting healthy connection tactics, praying, offering them spiritual advice, and reasoning with “a potential justified cause” of this behavior. Multiple times and it unfortunately had been happening this way my entire life. I urge you to find good community and expose yourself to a healthy relationship. You’ll see so quickly the red flags that they’d manipulated to look like slight yellows and light greens in the beginning or throughout the relationship.

I get hesitant to write about the very real experience, because I get watched online. That’s the worst part about it. I will never understand how someone could choose to hurt you, so you feel unwanted. But when you leave and seek support they even know you deserve, they either watch you or have people do it for them. Blasphemous. It just speaks to the fact that you do not deserve this. Over the past 4-5 years, my abusers have stalked me and continually harassed me with post-relational abuse, even though I let them be and chose to heal in private. You don’t have to. You can be as loud about your pain as you need, because you suffer in silence. You deserve to heal. You deserve to smile. You deserve true love.

I watched a video this morning of a girl about to marry a man that wasn’t even sure of her and now, she’s marrying a very good man, who believes her to be his best friend and the true love of his life. The reality is, unlike what some of us have heard similarly but were never treated right, this man was all about his talk. So, I say this to say that your love is waiting for you in SO many forms, please know it’s possible for each of us. TRUE Love finds you in the ways that you need the most throughout life, and it’ll never make you feel confused. Not about yourself of anything else. It’ll be the most certain and safest experience you’ve ever had. I’m wishing the best for you all. 

If you ever need emotional support or affirmations, please contact me! Xo",2025-03-13 13:13:09,2025-03-17 02:12:35,all_new_posts

1ja6ydr,I left but I'm scared I'll go back.,derrrskinner,4,2025-03-13 08:01:19+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ja6ydr/i_left_but_im_scared_ill_go_back/,"I posted here before, but that’s not really relevant anymore- Yesterday, I packed some of my shit and left my emotionally abusive ex (let’s call him Chris again). He gave me a three-hour lecture about how I'm the worst person alive, how I’m leaving him during the worst time of his life (his mom is sick, and everything is chaotic— I do feel bad about that part, I loved the old woman), how I’m a selfish, disgusting rat for “ruining his family” because I ""don’t feel right here anymore,"" and how I’ve been lying about loving him all this time. He said he’d be dead the second I stepped my foot out the door.

He threatened suicide multiple times and even cut his wrists while I was still there, but I should be thankful that he was “nice enough not to kill himself in front of me.” I listened, took it all in, and then left.

Then, on the bus, I got a call asking me to go back because someone needs to watch the dog while he’s at work tomorrow. For a second, I almost caved and went back. But instead, I called my dad, who helped me get my head straight over the phone. We made a plan, and I really left. I actually left. Can you believe that?

Now, I know I’m stupid, but I’m going back to look after the dog for today. That poor thing didn’t ask for any of this. Chris won’t be home while I’m there, so I’ll have a chance to pack up more of my stuff. But I still feel like I should go back. Last night, he lovebombed me, and for a second, I thought he might change (I’ll include some of his messages at the end). But I texted my cousin, who’s basically my biggest supporter and protector since we were kids, and she told me, “Oh HELL NAH, don’t believe a word he’s saying. It’s all manipulation.” So, I didn’t reply to Chris and went to sleep instead.

The first afternoon and night were pure hell. I had the longest, most painful breakdown of my life, crying and screaming like a little kid for around four hours after I got to my mom’s place. It was strange because Chris was actually on the phone with my mom when I arrived, crying to her about me.

I was considering catching a night bus back to apologize, to beg for his forgiveness, but instead, I texted someone again- my friend 'Dave' this time (who I’ve been accused of cheating with multiple times). Dave is straight, younger than me, and lives far away, he's like a little brother. The “evidence” for cheating? Dave calls me “babe” as a joke, which he does with all of his friends. Chris knew this before we even got together. Dave and I talked, and he said he thought I hated him because I hadn’t reached out in a while— I didn’t feel like I was allowed to. When I told Dave the entire story and about feeling guilty and wanting to apologize to Chris, he reacted the same way as my cousin: “Oh HELL NAH, don’t go back. I’m begging you, don’t go back.” So, maybe I’m not the bad guy after all.

Now, I’m on the bus back to Chris’ town, and I feel sick to my stomach. I’m scared that being there will make me weak, that I’ll regret leaving and want to stay. Please tell me I’m not crazy and that I made the right choice by leaving. Right now, I feel like I might have made the wrong one. My brain knows I did the right thing, but my feelings are all over the place.



The late night message without the really personal parts:
Hey there. I don't want to harass you, no misunderstanding, I just want you to know that I love you. I know that I made a mistake and that I wasn't good enough to you, as well as that lately I haven't been a good company, there were many problems, mom and dad, everything was upside down, I neglected you, I didn't speak to you as I should have and I am terribly sorry for that. And no, I don’t want to make excuses because there is no excuse for this. ...  I'm sorry I don't know how much this will help, if it will make things worse, I don't even know. I admit that I was wrong and that I wasn't good enough for you. I know that I yelled a lot, that I was passive aggressive, that many times I viewed you as nothing, that many times for my mistakes I blamed you. I saw that I behaved very badly and that I was wrong. You didn't deserve this. I can only hope that these few lines can give you a better insight and I would like to ask you for a second chance, I would like to prove to you that I will change and make you happy. And what we planned together is to make them come true. I know you are afraid. I'm scared too. ...  Please don't leave me, you're my everything, you are the one I've always wanted. You're all I have. I don't want anyone else, I don't need anything, just to be able to look into your beautiful eyes every morning and say I love you. I'm sorry that I was a jerk, idiot, wretch with you. I want to change and prove to you that I am changing and that our relationship has meaning. ... You are my only star, my moon, my sun, my light, my day, my evening, my everything. I love you. And I’ll always love you, I don’t know why I fell in love with you, I only know that I love you more every day, even if I didn’t show it. 😞 ... I needed this big stinking slap to think about this stuff and about myself. I'm sorry that I was like this, I hope I can get another chance from you, I love you, sleep well, have nice dreams, I love you",2025-03-13 08:01:19,2025-03-17 02:12:38,all_new_posts
1ja5s82,It's been almost three months...,Pitiful_Bug6336,2,2025-03-13 06:30:33+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ja5s82/its_been_almost_three_months/,"This is my first time sharing and posting on Reddit, I apologize if this is a lot..
Not really sure how to start a topic like this but I guess I'll start with the small stuff and try to keep this from being a novel.
I am a 25 year old (male) and my relationship ended 3 months ago with my 31 year old (female) SO.

Things between us started out like most relationships do; Overwhelming joy, sensations of true love/intimacy and feeling like we finally found ""the one.""

Fast forward three months into our relationship, I started noticing sudden changes in my SO's behavior. The night I started noticing these shifts, her tense body language and cold shoulder responses to me indicated that there was something wrong. I approached her with what I noticed and sat down to talk with her. She was cold with her tone and quick to anger. Still confused as to why she was coming off this way towards me, I asked her ""what's wrong?"" She blew up on me.
""You still have all these girls on your social media pages and it's extremely suspicious, I went through all of my personal profiles and cleaned house. If you really loved me, you still wouldn't have these random girls in your friends lists.""

After hearing this, it was a gut punch. I trusted her and I felt like she trusted me but with what she told me, it pinched my mind.Trying to reassure her, I told her I had no problem with going on my pages and removing all of my ""female friends"" if that meant proving to her that she had nothing to worry about. Mind you, I had done nothing prior or in that moment to break her trust. I understand insecurities and that early on in a relationship it is agreeable to have them.

This was a small fight which led to more fights down the road. From a fight in one month, to one fight a week, to 3 arguments a day, to 3 days nonstop verbal abuse and silent treatment. Almost 95% of our fights had to do with her accusations of my actions and her viewpoints of me.
I could not be any more transparent than I was with her and I still don't understand to this day, why she never chose to trust me or have faith in our relationship.

At around 6 months in our relationship, we had just moved into a new apartment. The 3rd day that we were there, she started accusing me of cheating on her. Knowing that this never happened and that I full heartedly believe in monogamy, she threatened to end our relationship. No matter how hard I tried to reassure her, prove to her that she is wrong and tell her that I could not allow myself to perform infidelity, it had no use.
She was extreme with her verbal insults, immensely accusatory of things she thinks that I did and brutal with her belittling. She said ""I am done with this relationship and it's over. Go find someone else.""
She ended up leaving our apartment, for the whole day without answering her phone to my texts or calls. Distraught, I still had to continue forward with my day with this situation infecting my mind.
I had to DJ for a wedding that day so I couldn't dedicate my time to fixing this fight. The whole day, I had to bottle up my emotions, perform and create a joyful atmosphere for this wedding and be a witness to the romance happening in front of me. Meanwhile, my life is crushed and my heart hurting through every pump. When I had finally finished my job, I felt horribly lost, hopeless and lifeless, crying the whole way back to my apartment.

When I got to my apartment, she had came back. After unpacking all of my gear, I came into my living room and sat down across from her on the opposing couch. I broke down in front her and just kept asking why she felt this way and what did I do to make you feel this way. Her response ""you should already know and I don't want to be with you, I think you should leave.""
Hearing this, I felt absolutely numb and questioned myself what the point of living is anymore. 
I got up without saying a word from the couch, stared at her while tears rolled down my face and I pulled my handgun from my pocket and put it to my head. She froze as she stared at me with no expressions in her eyes and no concern on her face.
I'm this moment, I was one second away from ending my life, all because I felt like my life wasn't worth living if I wasn't with her. She told me to put the gun down and I didn't move. She then grabbed her phone and called my mom. My mom answered and asked what was going on. She told her that I had a gun to my head. If it wasn't for my mother and the fear I heard in her voice, I wouldn't be posting this today. I left the apartment and I stayed at my parents house that night and gave my handgun to my dad, promising that I would never do this again.

I made the decision to start therapy a week later, to try and understand myself and my situation better.

10 months in and it only got worse.
This was the first time a full day of disagreements, turning into an arguments led to my SO physically abusing me.
I had enough of the back and forth bickering and locked myself in my bedroom. A few hours passed and I unlocked the bedroom door, hoping that my SO was calmed down and ready to have a healthy talk about what had upset her. Instead, she came in with the same aggressive behavior and told me to get out of bed and go sleep on the couch. I had established my position and place in the bedroom and told her I was not going anywhere and that her hostile behavior needed to change. Unphased, she circled around our bed, grabbing at me, pulling the sheets off of me and screaming in face to get out or she was going to hit me. As I backed up against the headboard, clutching at my phone recording this incident, she climbed ontop of the bed and repeatedly tried grabbing my phone out of my hand. She finally managed to grab my phone and threw it.
She then threw her fist straight into my left eye, punched me hard enough to where my vision went blurry. Struggling to get out from underneath her, I managed to wrap my arms around her shoulders and pin her back to the head board telling her stop and that I was not going to let her hit me again. After 5 seconds, I let go and immediately grabbed my phone and left the room. I heard her start crying while I left the room and went straight downstairs to the living room. 20 minutes past and she had come downstairs to the front door when I heard loud knocking coming from. She opened the door and 3 sheriff's had arrived. She called the cops and had told them about the incident that occured.

I was on the phone with my mom when this happened and I told her what was going on. The sheriff's approached me and asked me to come outside to talk about the situation. I did not hang up with my mom and put my phone in my pocket. Completely flustered and distraught, I was crying and in shock with what just happened, trying not to  believe that my SO would do this to me. The sheriff's were very aggressive towards me while they asked their questions. They were also asking my SO what happened inside my apartment at the same time.
After telling them 3 times what had happened, I told them I recorded the event on my phone. They asked to see it right away and I pulled my phone out of my pocket and my mother had still been on the call the whole hour I was outside. She heard everything the police had to say. I had to hang up on her and I showed them the video. Their tone with me changed in an instant and I no longer felt aggression from the authorities, rather it was support. After this, another 20 minutes went by and they finished with their report. They suggested that I should find another place to stay for the night but that I was more than welcome to stay at my apartment. I agreed with their suggestion and one sheriff offered to help me pack some clothes, food for my dog and my belongings. He then helped me bring them out to my car and said that they had the rest of the night handled and to get to my parents safely. A few nights went by and my SO and I discussed this incident. I had talked to my parents and close friends about this and they suggested that I end this relationship because it is not healthy. I told them that I still love her and that I believed that turning the other cheek, like Jesus was what I gave myself as an excuse to forgive my SO.

This situation repeated and happened two more times.

The second incident happened without the cops being called and involved, where my lip was busted and I was forced out of my apartment.
The third time, the last time, she punched me again in the face and clawed at my chest. The cops got involved with this and it was moments before I had to leave for work. This was also the last moment I held my son before my EX-SO took off and moved to another city to live with her mom.

Throughout all of this, my SO was pregnant with our son. She blamed her behavior and lack of control over her emotions on her hormones, sleep deprivation and post partum. Regardless, it continued even after her pregnancy. We are no longer together and our relationship ended 3 months ago.
She took my son with her and lives in another city, 120 miles away from me.

I filed a parenting plan 3 days after we broke up and she was served 8 days after I filed my petition and proposed parenting plan. I have not had one peaceful conversation with her since. When she moved, she started rumors and falsehood all over social media about me and my actions. Knowing that nothing she has been saying and claiming is true, she continues with this detrimental behavior towards me. The worst part, I have not seen or been with my son in 3 months. This is primarily due to her gatekeeping and withholding our son from me. This is alienation.

I cannot reach out to her because she has me blocked on all forms of communication. Even further, she has randomly and periodically unblocked me to harass me and further hurt my heart with false promises to go back to blocking me once again.

The worst part is that even throughout all this damage, I miss my Son beyond comprehension of words and I fail my own heart mind, still thinking and feeling that I love her and feel my heart crush itself over and over, knowing that I will never be close to her again.

1ja5omq,I don’t know why I keep going back,ZealousidealTale196,2,2025-03-13 06:23:11+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ja5omq/i_dont_know_why_i_keep_going_back/,"Boyfriend (34M) is emotionally and physically abusive to me (34F) and I don’t know how to leave. 

1. He blames me for everything including things like his cocaine/alcohol addiction problems that he had before he met me. Said it was my fault that he relapsed twice. 

2. Publicly humiliates me. Wants to FaceTime me so that everyone can hear him screaming at me. Calls me every name in the book. 

3. Has broken my iPhone several times (did not replace them or pay me back) and has tried to damage my car. Has even damaged an Airbnb property once and I was forced to pay for the damages. 

4. Has physically hurt me on multiple occasions, but because he did not use his fists, he says it doesn’t count as a hit. He once pulled my hair in front of kids. The mother of his kids had to call me to tell me that he’s physically hurt her too when they were dating and she’s sad that he’s continuing the cycle. 

5. Always screams at me if I am not doing something he approves of. Thinks that his opinion is the only thing that matters. I told him that my body is starting to respond to him in a way that I feel lost, numb, I’m becoming forgetful and uneasy. I started hanging up on him or if we are in the car, I’ll just get out if we are in a stop sign. It’s never a good idea when I do it but I feel like I need to for my sanity. 

6. I can’t hang out with my friends and family and I am not allowed to be alone. I work from home but I am not allowed to go to my work office and if I do he’s constantly FaceTiming me and if I don’t answer him, he threatens to come to the office. 

7. Always accusing me of cheating and because I have a child from a previous relationship he’s always accusing me of being with my daughter’s father. If I don’t answer my phone he’s always assuming that I am having sex with someone else. 

8. Always ruins holidays, birthdays, special occasions etc. Today was our 2nd year anniversary and he refused to spend time with me because he no longer sees me as a potential wife. (I feel relieved but knowing his patterns idk if I am in the clear yet)

9. Bad mouths me to his friends and family as if I am the one constantly hurting him. But acts like this “good” guy in front of his family and strangers. Says it’s my fault that he has to treat me like crap because he doesn’t treat other people like that. 

10. Intimidates me if I chose to leave him. Will call me non-stop and shows up to my house if I try to block him. I’ve had the cops come once but it didn’t do much. He cries and begs me to take him back. But then the moment he has me, he’s back to mistreating me, then breaks up with me again for any little reason. It’s almost as if he needs the control of being the one to break up with me. 

Despite all this, I find myself yearning for him. I feel sick thinking that the person who I hate the most, I want to be with the most. I don’t know how to get out. I know I don’t like how I feel when I am with him, but when he’s not around I miss him. This has morbidly messed up my brain. I never had an abusive relationship until I met this man. 

I understand I am at fault for constantly allowing him to come back.

1ja4ovo,"Problem with my boyfriend ""jokingly"" choking me",cycas-cycad,16,2025-03-13 05:13:21+00:00,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ja4ovo/problem_with_my_boyfriend_jokingly_choking_me/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 1 year, living together for 6 months. We've had a lot of problems with him crossing boundaries and I'll admit he has gotten better, but only after it gets to the point where I almost break up with him.

A little more context, we speak different languages, we know each other's language but we're not fluent. And I plan on moving to his county at the end of the year, but I've been planning on moving there even before I met him. 

The most recent problem is 4 days ago he jokingly grabbed my neck and pretended to choke me. It wasn't hard enough that it hurt and that I couldn't breathe, but hard enough to scare me. I have trauma with choking, so as soon as he did it I told him very clearly ""don't do that"" and ""I don't like that"".

I thought that would have been enough, but later that day he did it again in the parking lot before we went grocery shopping. I again told him not to do that and he asked ""why, do you have trauma? Who was it? I'll fight them"" (which I know was a joke because he doesn't  fight) I didn't want to unload right before entering the store so I just told him to let it go. 

Yesterday I was about to initiate sex, I was on top of him and once again he did it. So I walked away, and as I left he told me not to be so sensitive. Then when he realized how mad I was he apologized. And I told him if he does it one more time I will break up with him and he agreed not to do it again.

So the past day I didn't talk to him much because I was thinking about what I wanted to say and how to explain to him how serious that action was. Today we argued for about an hour and he said he played around pretending to choke me because I didn't tell him why I didn't like it, so he didn't  think I was serious. And I explained that I shouldn't have to give a reason, telling him I don't like being touched a certain way and that it makes me uncomfortable should be enough for him not to do it. 

The conversation spiraled into him saying that I'm accusing him of being a bad person and that he's not good enough for me, and that I should just find a better man. And this is how all of our conversations go when I'm trying to tell him how I feel and trying to figure out how to resolve things.

I do want this relationship to work because when we're not arguing and everything is good I couldn't imagine myself without him. But he's just so stubborn and I don't know how to get through to him and make him realize the things he says and does can be seen as abusive.

1ja4m3h,How bad are these messages?,Fran87412,20,2025-03-13 05:08:14+00:00,32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ja4m3h,"I feel like I’m perpetually stuck in a loop of always coming back to doubting. I’m so sick of it. I just want to be done. It’s like my brain defaults and tries to undo progress made. It will tell me I’m just being too sensitive. Or want to garner sympathy as a victim. Like imposter syndrome or something. And I wonder, if you haven’t really known a healthy relationship, is it just really hard to see how bad a bad one is?

I don’t want to call something abuse if it’s not, though I’ve done my homework and see the patterns. So I organized “receipts” that I could come back to whenever I doubt (please be nice, I’d like to think this is a safe space, but I fear some people might think I’m crazy for compiling receipts). 

Photo 1 is some mean things they said to me. Photo 2 are some back to back messages I felt exemplified what would contribute to cognitive dissonance.

Part of me is always afraid I’m in the wrong for thinking it’s abusive. TIA for any perspectives, especially contrasting to healthy relationship dynamics or identifying abusive dynamics if present!

It’s been over the 48 hour limit and….. crickets. I don’t think it it getting approved. What do I do now? Do I utilize the no cost lawyer I found and just file for divorce and hope he doesn’t come home and break all my stuff? Do I hope he doesn’t decide to put a hand on me for the first time? Our current agreement is I am at our home during the week. He is supposed to be at our home on the weekends. We have 2 kids I watch during the week. 

This past weekend he was out of town so we haven’t gotten to try this out yet. I’m also pretty scared to leave the kids with him at all (look at prior posts, specifically my first one). I’m debating just staying at our home while he is here so his time with the kids is still supervised. 

I anticipate he will be a different person once I file and he is notified. I am afraid of the calls he will make and the limits he will go to in order to show me how hurt he is. In order to control me. 

My main concern is I have secured a no cost lawyer and I don’t expect the lawyer to just keep sitting around waiting for me to file. I feel like I need to file for divorce rather soon. I have not heard from the lawyer yet personally they have not reached out but I plan to call tomorrow. 

He has told me he will start looking for other places but is concerned how long it will take due to not having any savings. He has told me he will go with me to get a custody agreement notarized at the end of the week, in which I will have them during the week and he gets supervised time on the weekends. I don’t know if I can trust his word but this is what he says.   

Advice? Do I just file and hope for the best at this point? Wait until we have the custody order notarized? I have no money to my name so if I lose this lawyer for waiting too long, I’m kind of screwed. ",2025-03-13 00:49:30,2025-03-17 02:12:53,all_new_posts

She's fallen for the same lies yet again. At first she had lied about who she had been seeing this whole time to me and my mother, as she knew how we would both react. She lied about the name, where they met, how they met etc. She made up such an extravagant lie just to keep her relationship with him a secret. Before she admitted anything, I had actually found out myself she was back with him two months ago, after I asked to use her phone to order something on her Amazon Prime account and seen an inappropriate text from him under his name pop up on the screen. I can't explain how I felt in the moment. I wasn't even sad, just disappointed. My sister had chosen to be celibate to be more closer to God after they had broken up all those years ago. To see that text and knowing she broke it for him, disgusts me. I didn't confront my sister or tell my mother at the time, I kept it to myself as it had to be my sister to tell her.

Cut to a few days ago, he received his food stamp card and offered to buy us groceries. My mother, still believing him to the person she's made up the whole time, says she'd like to meet him since he's offering to do such a nice gesture and that's when she finally came out and confessed who he really was. I had never seen my mother so distraught in my entire life, there was no consoling her. My sister is her first born and she just couldn't believe after all the pain, humiliation, the cheating, lies and even him almost ruining her credit, that'd she still give him another chance. But for whatever reason my sister wholeheartedly believes that he's changed and that God has shown him the way.

Despite her denials, I can see she's falling back into her old habits. Going out of her way for him every step of the process. Doing his laundry, letting him use her work issued public transport debit card, taking time off work to be with him. Anything he needs, she gives.

He used to live in his own apartment with a roommate but had soon gotten evicted, then he moved in with his brother for about a month or so. Got kicked out due to his brother's manipulative tendencies(Or at least that's what he told her). Currently, he's homeless and living in a shelter after much of his family, according to her abandoned him. And she feels bad because in her words ""he has no one else to turn to.""

So far, ever since she confessed the news, my mother has been so depressed. She barely comes out of her room unless she's doing chores or going to work. She barely speaks any words to my sister. My sister actually had the nerve to ask my mom if he could stay to take a nap for a few hours since his shelter puts them out for a few hours until they're allowed to come back. My mother has since disowned her. In her own words she stated that ""their relationship is done."" Now I'm just caught in the middle, working out how I feel.

I should note that both me and my mother have also gone through our own experiences of toxic and abusive relationships and we have luckily gotten away. I want my sister to be happy but I also have to look at the facts, no matter how much someone has changed there's just no possible way to build trust in them again. If they've abused you once, they'll do it again.",2025-03-13 00:40:11,2025-03-17 02:12:54,all_new_posts
1j9zcde,unsure if this can be considered some form of abuse,suprisedpikachumeme,1,2025-03-13 00:26:59+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j9zcde/unsure_if_this_can_be_considered_some_form_of/,"(reposted because i’m not sure if anyone saw my last post) 

I (17f) was in an online relationship/friendship with a girl i’ll refer to as J (16F), i met J in around late 2020 or early 2021 when i was 13 years old, we started dating a couple months later when i was 14. I broke up with her when i was 16, but i stayed friends with her until a few days ago.

it’s a very long and confusing story, but i’ll explain in the shortest way possible. 

I noticed some things when we were dating that were kind of red flags to me. at the time i had a habit of venting to J about a specific friend group instead of communicating with my friend group, when i vented to J she’d tell me to leave that group. i was having trust issues about that friend group (which were completely irrational, by the way. i was just overthinking and didn’t handle it the right way.) but i didn’t wanna leave the friend group. J convinced me to leave the friend group on two occasions (first time, J told me she’d leave someone who harmed her if i left that friend group. second time, she told me that leaving them would be her “best christmas present”, when i expressed that i missed the friend group, she acted really disappointed in me.) J would also say really ableist things. she once said “people who can’t count money are *slur for mentally disabled people that i don’t want to say*” even though she KNOWS i can’t do that, but  she said i was the “exception”. she would also kinda… brag? about doxxing people.

december 2023 to september 2024, i was receiving anonymous harassment on and off. whoever was harassing me would use very personal stuff against me, so i knew it was someone i knew personally. It was even more apparent that it was someone i had known when someone texted my phone number (again, with personal info that only 2 people would’ve known about) 

the other day, i found out that most of this harassment during that time came from J herself. i also found out that J told one of her ex friends that she wanted to isolate me from my friends in order for me to rely solely on her, J also told this ex friend that she “liked watching me be upset”, and apparently dated me as a joke. she made up so many lies about me, J even accused me of something so horrid, despite knowing i have trauma about the exact thing i was accused of. 


J told me lies about this ex friend before, the same lies she told the ex friend about me, and i wasn’t allowed to talk to this ex friend (the ex friend and i had some issues, the ex friend wanted to explain this stuff to me but since J told me she’d block me if i spoke to the ex friend, i didn’t hear the friend out. I only messaged the ex friend because i found out J was harassing her as well.) after talking to the ex friend, i blocked J on everything. i feel a little bit bad and i’m doubting myself about my decision. my mother and multiple friends were telling me this didn’t seem right back when i was dating J, and my old therapist even called J an abuser 

i’m wondering if this can be considered abusive in any way. reading this back, i don’t think it was and i kinda feel stupid for posting this. i’m sorry if this is confusing. ",2025-03-13 00:26:59,2025-03-17 02:12:55,all_new_posts

I left my abuser recently, and his voice haunts me on a minute-by-minute basis. One of his main “issues” with me was that I am “constantly seeking validation from men” and that my “body language” and the way I behave and dress in public shows him, and everyone else in the world, that I need attention and validation from men. Therefore, I disrespected him constantly throughout our entire relationship. He often used this as an excuse for his anger and abuse. He has said to me many times I don’t deserve respect because of the way I act, and no man will ever want to be with someone like me. I’ll spare the grim details, but he’s called me every name in the book and screamed at, belittled, coerced and intimidated me on a daily basis. I started to really believe him. 

I tend to be bubbly, extremely relational, and enjoy chatting people up (although these traits have all been beaten down to a pulp and are now completely absent). I guess some could interpret this as “flirty”, but his accusations and abuse surrounding my personality have left me perplexed, hurt, and in a dangerous thought spiral believing that I am and was a horrible partner. I understand the way gaslighting and these abusive dynamics work, and logically know he has deep rooted misogynistic beliefs and extremely controlling behaviors, however I still find myself constantly questioning my actions and the way I show up in the world in the aftermath of the relationship. I’m curious if anyone has heard a variation of this from an abusive partner? I feel crazy. ",2025-03-12 22:34:46,2025-03-17 02:13:59,all_new_posts

I've not typed this out before so I'll try to be descriptive without giving myself away.

My husband and I have been together for almost 20 years. We met online when I was 16 through a game. He was around 24. By the time I was 18, I moved overseas to be with him.

He had assured me that I had a job lined up - it was my one caveat to moving. I had made it clear that I never wanted to be a stay-at-home partner. When I got there, I found that it had been false.

Several years later, despite my birth control pills, I became pregnant. Originally, I didn't want it, but it was too late to abort so we went through with it and made things work. We were still living with his parents. We got married shortly before I gave birth. Almost two years later (being overseas for around 7 years by this point), I had the chance to borrow some money from a family member to move back to my original country with him and our child, to which he was excited and agreed as finances and recession had become a struggle in his country.

We were happy, nothing appeared wrong. We moved back to my previous country, I started studies to regain a foothold into the workforce as I had been out of it for seven years. He took a freelance job working from home. Money was very tight but we were making our little family work.

Over time, things changed. I grew, I got a degree and stepped into the workforce. He remained home with our child and his part time freelance job, which slowly became more full time. He didn't earn a lot, and I earned a little more, but we were slowly paying debt from the move and coming into ourselves.

Several years later, he got a full-time job in an office doing what he really enjoyed. He hated the town we were in but said he stayed for us and that he knew our finances were much better in this country. The office ended up being a very toxic environment, however, and one year later his role was disestablished and he was made redundant. Unrelated to his predicament (primarily due to covid struggles of small businesses), I was also made redundant from my job.

Emotions ran high, we were both stressed, but I managed to gather the money and move us a few hours away to a place he loved after I got another job a few months later. I thought it would ease his stress, and despite his struggles finding another job, he ended up going back to his old freelance work.

I thought he would find something better but he did not. I begged him to go to therapy as I watched him crumble - he had attempted to unalive himself during redundancy. I had been to therapy for about a year and been diagnosed and medicated with several mental health issues, which he claimed were not real. He said he preferred me off my medication, and I was not the girl he married. He started getting emotionally distant, abusive. Days of silent treatment and brooding, and punching furniture and throwing objects around when he got upset.

My friends have told me for years I am in an abusive relationship. I read a book from the library called Invisible Wounds and he got angry at the idea when he appeared to match all characteristics of a covert narcissist.

This Christmas past, he got really bad. He eventually apologised after I told him I was leaving with our child. He has started going to therapy, but I'm worried because despite all of the concerns I told the therapist in private, the therapist has seemed to dismiss it in favour of giving my husband a referral for ADHD instead.

He takes no responsibility for actions. He does not know how to cook or drive, or do basic adult tasks. He completely shuts down when I try to explain my feelings, getting defensive and claiming I'm blaming him for things when all I am trying to do is describe how I feel.

Something small as an example from just last night. He seems to really get upset if I go to bed earlier than him. I get up at 6am for work, he gets up around 11-12. He always seems disappointed and incredulous as he asks ""What? You're going to bed already?"" when I tell him I am going to bed around 10pm. I tried to tell him my thoughts and feelings politely and clearly. He came up and sat on the bed as I was in bed. I asked him what he was up to because he sat quietly for a while. He said he ""didn't want to become one of those people going to bed at 9 or 10"" as he's always said. I told him he had no obligation to, explained my early start times, and that I understood that he got upset if I went to bed early but it wasn't sustainable for me to go to bed as late as him, as it meant I only got four or five hours of sleep per night. He told me he doesn't get upset and I can go to bed whenever I want. I told him I do go to bed whenever I want and explained that he does get upset, he acts incredulous and disappointed every time I do, and he said he felt like he was being told off. I told him I was just explaining my feelings and that I wasn't saying anything negative, just how I felt, and he did his... I don't know how to explain it. He shuts his eyes and fists really tight and rolls his head as if his neck hurts, and then walked out. He stonewalls me every time.

I'm afraid I may have said enough to give me away if he finds this, though he isn't one to browse Reddit. I have small clip recordings, texts, messages. But it's all from my point of view too. I can't seem to explain to the therapist how bad it is, and I know I've repeatedly been told to leave, but he is in another country alone. I am also aware that it's ""not my responsibility"" but I am doing my best, yet again, to make this work. He waits until I seem to be ""fine"" again and then he goes back to his old self. I am also aware that, despite his passionate claims that he would never hurt me physically, there is always a chance. I am physically sick from the emotional toil it is taking, and I struggle to get into work every day. If I work from home, he seems irritated and claims that I'll ""get fired if I'm not careful"". I believe he is projecting his own insecurities on me for that, and other things.

TLDR: I am financially capable of walking away, but not mentally. I have repeatedly attempted to help him over the years but he keeps reverting back. I understand that I can't help someone who won't help themselves, but there's an invisible blocker in my head and heart that stops me from doing the logical thing. I am unsure what to do, how to explain it all to the authorities or even who to explain it to, and feel guilty about sometimes wishing something would happen to him to make it easier for me and our child.",2025-03-12 22:06:33,2025-03-17 02:14:02,all_new_posts

It's gotten even worse since then, with her flying into a rage every morning about something I did or didn't do. Yesterday it was because I had forgotten to light the mosquito coils by the back door. The day before it was because I had been playing with our son rather than washing the dishes (of which there were about three dirty plates). Shes yelled point blank that I ""disgust"" her and that she ""hates"" me. It's exhausting and distressing, and if it was just me, I'd have left long ago.

But we have a 3yo child who I adore and he adores me. I spend basically every moment outside of work caring and raising him. We even coslept together. But for the past few months my wife has been accusing me of being an unfit and negligent parent. Her reasons, in my opinion, are trivial, like missing a patch of skin while applying sunscreen or packing the wrong coloured hat in his daycare bag, but she considers my errors life-endangering, either because she is neurotic or because she's intentionally trying to position herself as the primary carer if we seperate.

The thought of having to stay in a hostile relationship fills me with dread, but the thought of only seeing my son half the week or less is worse. My worst nightmare is that I move out a my wife cuts off all contact between me and my son. I don't have the money to take her to court, and even if I did, a trial could take months or even years, by which time my son might not even recognise me.

Anyway, I dont expect anyone to have a solution. I just thought I'd share, and maybe give some insight into why some people stay in abusive or unhappy relationships. Thanks.",2025-03-12 19:57:45,2025-03-17 02:14:04,all_new_posts

I blocked him and stopped sharing my location with him. For three days he tried to call me, even though he's blocked the blocked calls still show in your call log. Court was on Tuesday. He hasn't tried to call since. The last time court happened he became very verbally/emotionally aggressive towards me. He asked for a modification on his house arrest and ankle monitor. The judge read my statement against him and then said denied. He was extremely angry, though he would never outright say that. 

Its been almost a week and I sometimes feel a sense of relief. I feel relieved that I'm not getting called told that I'm showing my gaping hole to the gym when I go to deadlifts, I'm glad he's not starting fights and questioning me about who is at the gym, im glad I can talk to who ever I want and be friends with whoever I want and won't be called a whore. I'm glad that I can sit in my car for as long as I want and I won't be accused of cheating on him. I'm glad that i am not paying his bills, giving him money or buying him things. I don't have to worry about people approaching me in the gym or spending to long in a store. 

My body is waiting. It expects a phone call that ends in me screaming and crying. It expects a seemingly endless text thread berating me about how terrible I am, accusing me of something I haven't done... its just waiting for the next attack, except that attack isn't going to come. I feel anxious, constantly on edge. My body expects it. 
I feel an overwhelming sense of loneliness... and the urge to constantly talk to someone. I didn't realize how much time I wasted arguing and fighting with him... countless hours... now that I have all of those hours to myself I have no idea what to do with my self.

I (30F) just got out of a 3 month emotionally abusive relationship/situationship. I kept going back because I told myself that the words didn’t hurt me, someone’s words can’t affect me that way. So I pushed through for the sex, for the adventure, whatever else. And now I’m seeing the truth of how it’s affected me. 

In the end my abuser expressed sincere regret and apologized, took accountability for some things, expressed little nice things that almost felt…genuine but wrapped up in self protection. 

I was so kind to him in the end. I said I like the idea of seeing him again but I want to focus on myself. I said I didn’t want to end things on a bad note. And now I feel so fucking stupid for that. Why did I extend such kindness to someone who didn’t deserve it? I was empathetic because I thought he was being genuine, but he had many opportunities to apologize and take accountability and people don’t change overnight. I see the truth now. 

I feel embarrassed. Idk how to get past this feeling of regret. That I should have expressed my hurt more clearly. He got off the hook with the thought that “oh good, she doesn’t think I was so bad.” That was his goal all along. Protecting the way I saw him. ",2025-03-12 16:15:10,2025-03-17 02:14:11,all_new_posts

When I left I did so on the premise that we could work on the relationship. But now I’m like ‘why the hell should I?’ I’ve been holding this effed up relationship together all these years. He can put in the work. He can get therapy. He can also get the house ready for the market because no matter what I’m not moving back into it. There’s way too much trauma there. I get anxiety just pulling into the driveway. 

He is a mental mess. He cries all the time. He hasn’t been drinking like a mad man. He said “I feel like I’m losing you”. Weird cause you didn’t seem to feel that way when I filed for divorce three years ago, or the first couple times I tried to get an apartment. Or all the other times I tried to go back to my moms when we were younger. The words that have been coming out of my mouth didn’t give you any hints all these years? I use to say all the time “I won’t put up with this shit forever”. He didn’t believe a single word I ever said. And NOW he’s sad. I’ve been sad pretty much the entire relationship. He pushed me to the end of my rope so many times and now he feels like he’s losing me? Dumbass. 🤦‍♀️

I’m not going to give much info about myself because I’m still a little scared, but for the last 2 years I’ve been in a really toxic relationship with someone who used to be my best friend. He’s never persay hit me, but he has called me horrible names, screamed in my face, thrown and broken my stuff, and most recently I realized I was actually being abused because he tried to charge at me with a tool in an attempt to scare me/hit me. He claims he wasn’t going to hit me but it was truly terrifying. 

He made me dependent on him financially under the guise of just me never having to work again because I “deserved that”, and has used his wealth as an advantage over me because he told me he doesn’t believe anyone else would “deal with me” long enough to give me this kind of lifestyle (expensive cars, multiple houses, 3-4 vacations a year, luxury bags, shoes, etc).

It’s taken me a very very long time to accept that what’s happening and what has happened to me is abuse, and tonight I’m finally leaving for good. It’s been so relieving and also so scary to restart, I truly love him but I cannot keep putting myself through infidelity, verbal abuse, emotional abuse, gaslighting, and all of the short and long term effects of this. Please wish me luck. Also if you’re going through any of this please try to exit safely, you’re worth way more than this.",2025-03-12 14:56:24,2025-03-17 02:14:15,all_new_posts

Yesterday, it started.  Wagon was left out by the garage, so it was my fault the kid almost had a meltdown leaving for school because he wanted to go for a ride instead (the wagon always gets left out, including by her).  I was sitting on the floor gaming for like 30 minutes after spending a couple hours getting the house picked up.  That glass and XBOX remote?  I've left it on the floor a couple times before (which is synonomous with ""always""), better not do it again tonight.  Oh, you kept the laundry running?  You needed to put that rug through the wash a second time, now it's your fault if dog pee smell gets locked in.

On and on throughout the day with the *little* things, enough to put me back on eggshells in case I'd started to get comfortable again.  Enough to make me second guess everything I do, enough to make me think ""fuck, what else did I get wrong?"" when she enters the room.",2025-03-12 14:52:15,2025-03-17 02:14:16,all_new_posts

He left after I just finished battling a months-long depression. His explanation was he didn’t want to take care of me and “resented me”  for trying to “put my health in between him and his needs.” He also initiated the break up three days after my grandparents passed away. 

From the beginning I entered therapy to not burden him; i got on medication and even had my mom help me while he was away on a work trip. It was my first time dealing with mental health issues like this and it was scary for me, but no matter how much I tried to  alleviate him of responsibility it didn’t matter. The end of our relationship was plagued by gaslighting and stonewalling. He called me names and made me feel so alone and crazy. I thought I was losing my mind. 

Two days after he left he took our dog and never let me see him again because “he makes more money than me and I have no family in the city we live in.” Immediately after this he met and started dating a fan of his band and started dressing completely different. Despite my pleas for an explanation or closure, he never spoke to me again. I found out a month ago he gave our dog away to his mom shortly after we broke up. 

I’m in therapy, I’m practicing self care, and I’m thankfully surrounded by a wonderful community of friends. But I’m still so paralyzed. I just can’t wrap my head around why he treated me so poorly and the memories of what he did make me feel so ashamed. Ashamed because I can’t believe I let him treat me this way… and ashamed because part of me still believes him. 

If anyone can please help me or give me advice on what to do, or at least reassure me 6 months is not too long. I get so depressed sometimes thinking about everything that I don’t know what to do with myself. I also miss my dog, and I still haven’t really had the strength to process my grandparents’ deaths. I’m trying to save myself but it feels like I’m just not strong enough. ",2025-03-17 02:14:26,2025-03-17 02:38:50,all_new_posts
