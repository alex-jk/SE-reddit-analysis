1jcsdmi,Kids afraid of adults,Careful-Physics-7578,1,2025-03-16 18:40:48+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jcsdmi/kids_afraid_of_adults/,"We are currently away from my husband, in the early stage of divorce, with restraining order in effect. I am aiming to have majority of custody of our 2 kids. Restraint order is for coercive control, rough handling of kids, severe yelling/berating of kids. Recently my 4 year old has been showing fear of other caregivers, including me and my mother. We however are not abusive with him. He recently told me to be nice to his little sibling. and that I was scaring his sibling, he was afraid I would hurt him. Another time my mother went to take a toy from the toddler, because he was being rough with it. 4 year old ran, as if to protect my toddler, and grabbed my mother‚Äôs hands. 
To me, he has learned to be afraid of caregivers. On top of how I want him to feel safe and secure, I am worried he will express these fears to a parenting evaluator. Has anyone experienced this? Of course I reiterate to him that I would never hurt him or his sibling, and I‚Äôm hoping over time, and away from his dad, he will feel safer. I can‚Äôt help but be worried dad has created problems that will actually work against us, despite me efforts to keep everyone safe. ",,,

In October 2024 we got into an argument, he went to slap me but I pulled back. He destroyed the room broke all work computers and the TV. Said he‚Äôll never do that! Dec 2024 he was drinking , I said something to upset him he spit on me , threw stuff out of the house , grabbed me like in a choke hold claims bc I was going to hit him. Never have I attempted to hit him , I‚Äôm very or made any gesture for him to think that. 
Jan 2025 we get back and he blames the breakup bc of me. Till this day he blames me . Bc when he spit on me and kept spitting on me I did text my adult son to come , no I couldn‚Äôt call the cops. He‚Äôll take the phone from me ,so I would walk away and text my son quickly and hide the phone. My son came and the only reason he smacked him was bc he heard from outside my bf . He wasn‚Äôt going todo anything but tell him to go. So bc of this my bf blames me , everything is my fault the breakup and why we‚Äôre not living together  or good as we should be. 

My thing is, is there a chance he‚Äôll never do it again do they continue doing this??? He said sorry once and bc I said hey you know what you did so it‚Äôs your fault as well. Idk what to do it‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt take accountability. üòì i do love him idk if I can walk away . IIwas fine in Feb when we separated and then he comes back . ",,,
1jcmj5f,what proof do I need for custody battle,Lakewater22,2,2025-03-16 14:22:36+00:00,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jcmj5f/what_proof_do_i_need_for_custody_battle/,"
I‚Äôm in Georgia. He‚Äôs also a fucking attorney. And also my boss. 

He pays me pennys. He won‚Äôt help me buy a car after mine broke. 

He doesn‚Äôt help with anything. Like we had twins and I‚Äôm so exhausted doing this nearly alone with maybe a couple hours of break on random sundays. I need alone time. Desperately. 

I could list a novel of abuses. But I don‚Äôt even want to. 

We are not married. What proof do I need to get to the court to make sure he has the least amount of contact with the kids as possible after we leave. Like I literally cannot have him with the kids alone. I do not trust him. 

One twin has 3 different meds 6x a day‚Ä¶. He doesn‚Äôt even know the name of the meds let alone doses or doctors. Has never tried to learn or help. Hasn‚Äôt washed a bottle or made formula. 

Our son has 11 specialists. He hasn‚Äôt been to one appt. I‚Äôm juggling this alone borrowing cars from people. 

I am so proud of myself finally ready to leave. 

He‚Äôs abusive every way but physically. And it‚Äôs gotten so extreme. I just want to run away with the kids but need to get things in order first. 

What do I need to do? I researched a women‚Äôs shelter nearby. 

Idk how I can call, pretty sure there are cameras in the house. Can probably borrow my grams car to speak with someone there. 

Crazy thing is it‚Äôs my house/rental agreement, but of course he won‚Äôt leave because ‚Äúhe has tenant rights‚Äù. I‚Äôm supposed to resign the lease soon and idk if I will. I‚Äôll never find somewhere cheaper to live, but I need away from him and need him out. Sad. I love my landlord. 

Ugh. 

The only thing holding me back is him having any custody of the kids. If I knew for certain he couldn‚Äôt we‚Äôd leave everything behind right now. I guess I need to gather proof but idk what proof even. Like. Do I put cameras in my house, that‚Äôs legal in my state. 

Do I get a voice recorder, what kind??????

I feel like I should have been gathering evidence a month ago. But ugh. 

He cannot accept our son Down syndrome. The other day he told me of an intrusive thought of putting g habanero pepper on his tongue because he‚Äôs always sticking it out. Our son is 5 months old. 

I wish I had that recorded. 

I‚Äôm afraid he will harm our son. ",,,

1jclc96,looking back at my teenage relationship TW: SA,misformambo,1,2025-03-16 13:22:51+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jclc96/looking_back_at_my_teenage_relationship_tw_sa/,"he was younger than me by 1.5 years, we were in the same grade at school.  i was at one point legally an adult and he was still a minor but that doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt or couldn‚Äôt abuse me. i think i couldn‚Äôt accept what was happening because i was the adult, i was supposed to be the more mature one, i was supposed to be able to stand up for myself. i know now that it wasn‚Äôt my fault, that what he did was not okay and not right and i did not deserve to be treated that way by anyone.

i don‚Äôt like to label people as narcissistic because of all the stigma that comes with it but i wish that at some point during the abuse i looked up signs of narcissistic abuse, that i had listened to other‚Äôs stories and experiences because when i finally did seek out those stories, i was taken aback by how textbook his behaviours were and how many other people had experienced the exact same thing i had and it made me for the first time since meeting him feel like i wasn‚Äôt on my own.

tw: sexual abuse
sometimes i have flashbacks of small things that happened and instead of feeling disgusted in myself, i feel angry. that might not seem like a step in the right directed but before now i had never let myself be angry, i had made excuses for his behaviour and made myself the bad guy because he made me believe i was.

there were points where the name calling, the public humiliation and belittlement, the constant emotional rejection and sparingly given slivers of ‚Äòlove‚Äô would build up and i would explode. this would happen every month or so, where i stopped being a punching bag and told him that what he was doing was wrong and it was hurting me and i didn‚Äôt deserve it. i had never been truely angry before i met this man, had never felt pure resentment and rage towards someone before. i was proud of myself for telling him how i felt but every time i did, he would play the victim and say i was abusing him by being angry at him for what he was doing to me. 

this is the part that truely disgusts me: when i didn‚Äôt cave from him playing the victim, he would quickly shift to egging me on, making me more frustrated, then he would tell me how hot i was when i was mad, how much it turned him on and how much he liked it. then we would have sex, rough sex like we were fighting and whenever he tried to initiate this i would be too disgusted with him to even remotely feel like doing that but then he‚Äôd keep pushing and pushing until i was too emotionally exhausted to stop saying no. 

i don‚Äôt even know if i was raped or if that counts as rape, because i still feel the tiniest bit at fault as i was the one in that moment being mad and yelling for once.

i later learned that this is called reactive abuse and that it was a response that he too eagerly wanted to see from me.

I now have a partner who truely loves me, who could never dream of intentionally hurting me, who apologises even when their nose accidentally pokes my eye when we kiss.

i never fully realised the toxicity of that relationship until i was given this pure care and respect by my new partner. i am so grateful i found them because they have helped me rewrite all the bad memories with good ones and that was something that therapy couldn‚Äôt do for me in the way i needed.

i hope everyone here comes to feel some sense of peace and contentment, that you find the strength to go on and that you find people who genuinely care and love you",,,
1jcjw6p,"as it turns out, major trauma has major effects",Alarmed_Worry5555,5,2025-03-16 12:00:03+00:00,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jcjw6p/as_it_turns_out_major_trauma_has_major_effects/,"i feel so isolated in everything i‚Äôve been through. even knowing that other people have been through it, its usually straight cis women being abused by their straight male partners and it feels so deeply isolating 

im a trans gay man, my abuser was cis and ‚Ä¶idk bi or maybe just gay. (not really sure because he said he was bi when i met him and was still with his baby mama but later started implying he was just gay. but that could‚Äôve just been him saying that to throw me off the idea of him cheating on me with a woman.) doesn‚Äôt really matter either way ig, but it adds this whole extra layer to the abuse he put me through

whenever i started acting a way he didn‚Äôt like (like, showing emotion or asking him to give me basic aftercare, how fucking dare i) he would start saying im acting like a ‚Äúfemale‚Äù. 
in the aftermath of strangling me he told me he ‚Äúnever would have put his hands on me if i was a female‚Äù

its so obvious he only saw me as half a man at best. a weaker, inferior version of a man that he could rationalize and justify taking his anger and violence and aggression out on but was still ultimately beneath him, because of my femininity.

the first two months of our relationship were spent with him hiding me from everyone in his life. partially because he was cheating on me and his baby mama at the same time, and i think also partially because he was ashamed to be seen with me. even in places where nobody knew him, nobody would recognize him, he would make me wait in the car and go into shops alone. 
eventually he did make a point of introducing me to some of his coworkers but i honestly think the only reason he did that was because he ended up breaking up with her at some point (thats a whole other can of worms i dont want to open) and was trying to like. idk prove himself to me or something. it felt like the biggest deal in the world at the time but it probably meant nothing to him. 
he never took me out on a date. not once. he promised me he would. he always swore he would. but he never did. it was never important enough to him to make the time so it never happened. or maybe he just didnt want to be bothered or didnt want to be seen with someone like me in public. 

its just so hard. especially when he made a point to always use my correct pronouns and name. as he‚Äôs getting arrested, he calls me his boyfriend to the police. i wonder sometimes if he said that because he knew my mom could hear everything from the other line of the phone call, or if that‚Äôs how he really saw me. i guess it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference either way. its so hard to feel like i‚Äôm finally seen and desired and loved for who i am just to have it all ripped away from me and it just be a facade. i thought for once someone loved me FOR ME, not in spite of me. i‚Äôm not convinced that love will ever find me. it was supposed to be him. i was supposed to be his handsome boy i was supposed to be his boyfriend, his fianc√©, his husband. he told me once i was the cutest guy he‚Äôd seen in the world and he wanted to be together forever. how can you say everything i‚Äôve ever wanted to hear from the same mouth that drips such cruelty and venom for my very identity and soul? 

i feel so alone and isolated in this experience in general, but it just compounds so much more when nobody i‚Äôve talked to really understands or seems to care that queer and trans people get abused too 
its like we don‚Äôt matter at all
the police and courts have misgendered, disrespected and dismissed me every step of the way no matter how many times i correct them politely 
its exhausting 

i just want someone to understand what i‚Äôm going through. the severity and intensity of it all. how deeply it affected every aspect of my personhood, my identity, my life, my personality, everything. i feel like a completely different person and i‚Äôll never be the same. and nobody understands that. 

my parents expect me to be able to act rationally, logically, patiently to emotional situations but i can‚Äôt do it anymore like i used to. it all just comes out, i have no impulse control anymore when it comes to being triggered. its like i can‚Äôt stop myself from doing or saying things. and i know a lot of it isnt exactly easy for them to deal with and my mom has been patient but its almost like they expect nothing to have changed. and its so hard to feel that pressure to act ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and over it and hold it together and patient and the strong one for everyone else when i just want everyone to be strong and patient for me for once in my life. 

i was already so tired of giving and giving and giving and giving everything i have and never receiving but i have nothing left to give anymore. he took everything from me with him when he went to jail that day and there‚Äôs nothing left of me now. its just emptiness. i have no patience or empathy or support in me to give to the people around me. i have no energy left to put on the fake mask of the perfect polite palatable trauma victim because even when i do i get dismissed, ignored and disrespected. but i have no other choice ig.

I just want to hear from others how they got over their relationship and broke the emotional attachment because I‚Äôm really uncomfortable right now being alone and I feel extremely heart broken.

It makes me so sad and upset that he‚Äôs forgetting me and now I have no one. 


Repost 
I don‚Äôt know where to start. Lately, I feel disconnected from everything‚Äînumb, anxious, trapped in my own thoughts. I replay things over and over in my head, trying to make sense of them. I saw him again, and now I feel so stupid for going back.

For the first time in a long time, we spent the day together. At first, it felt familiar, almost comforting‚Äîlike nothing had changed. We laughed, joked, and fell into old habits. I miss the good parts of him. He‚Äôs funny, quick-witted, magnetic. But there‚Äôs always another side lurking underneath, waiting.

As the night went on, his demeanor shifted. He started making comments, grabbing at me, saying how long it had been since he‚Äôd had sex. I brushed it off, tried to change the subject. I just wanted to be with him without it turning into something else.

By 11 p.m., I told him I needed to leave‚ÄîI had driven three hours to see him, and I had a long drive home. But then he told me to take him 30 minutes away, to some random street. Said he had to use the bathroom. It didn‚Äôt make sense‚Äîthere were gas stations everywhere‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt question it. Maybe he just wanted to drive, listen to music.

When we got there, it was empty in a quiet neighborhood. He led me to the restroom, looked in the mirror, flexed, checked himself out. Then he grabbed my chest over my sweatshirt and said he wanted to see.

And in that moment, I knew.

I knew I had walked right back into something where I wasn‚Äôt respected. I felt ashamed‚Äînot just for being there, but for the part of me that still wanted his attention, even though I didn‚Äôt want to be touched by him.

I told him no. He laughed, said, Just do it. And I knew‚Äîif I kept refusing, he‚Äôd get annoyed, angry. So, like before, I gave in.

It escalated. He pulled his pants down while I kept saying, We‚Äôre not having sex. He said he knew‚Äîhe just wanted to ‚Äúnut.‚Äù He kept pushing me to take off my pants. I kept saying no. He kept pushing. And eventually, I gave in.

He sat on the toilet, made me stand in front of him for what felt like 30 minutes, biting me, slapping me every so often. I hated it. I kept thinking, How did I end up back here?

At one point, I tried to stop. I told him it was late, that this wasn‚Äôt why I came. I told him he lied‚Äîhe planned this. He just looked at me, knowing I wouldn‚Äôt leave. Then he pulled me closer, still exposed, still expecting me to keep going.

I felt trapped. If I refused, would he get angry? Would he turn on me?

Eventually, he finished. I just kept saying, What are we doing? This is so stupid. Can we go? I had a four-hour drive ahead of me, and none of this was what I wanted.

He acted surprised, like I was overreacting. Then he switched‚Äîhugging me, joking like nothing had happened.

He apologized, said he didn‚Äôt realize I‚Äôd be upset. Said he really cares about me. But it‚Äôs always the same‚Äîhe frames everything as ‚Äújust having fun,‚Äù but he never actually listens.

At one point, he put his hand on my neck in a sexual way‚Äîlaughing, acting like it was nothing.

But it‚Äôs not nothing.

I Keep Trying to Make Sense of It. But I Can‚Äôt.

A few months ago, I ended this relationship. And now I‚Äôm realizing‚ÄîI think it was abusive. But I feel so conflicted. I don‚Äôt want to ruin his life. He has nothing. No money. No stability. He clearly has mental health issues. But at the same time, I feel deeply wronged.

His family ignores what he does. When I try to talk about it, I feel gaslit‚Äînot just by him, but by them, too. It makes me feel crazy.

We were together for five years. There were good moments, but there were also times when I felt completely powerless. Things would feel fine for a while, and then something awful would happen. And then, it was like it never even happened. I started questioning my own memory.

But I know what happened.

These Are Some of the Things I Know Happened:
	One time, I was crying, and he slapped me in the face. The more I cried, the angrier he got.
	‚Ä¢	He pushed me into a towel rack during an argument. It dented. He was mad because I accidentally tossed his pants, and they hit his face.
	‚Ä¢	He tried to force me to drink shroom tea. When I refused, he shoved it toward me until it spilled, then slapped me hard, called me a ‚Äústupid bitch,‚Äù and blamed me.
	‚Ä¢	He stormed into my apartment once, furious that I left him at his brother‚Äôs house after drinking, even though I was trying to make sure he was safe. He threw my stuff everywhere, ripped my shirt in half off my body. My roommate had to kick him out.
	‚Ä¢	The first time he grabbed my neck, I was half-naked. Afterward, I had to get on a Zoom meeting, and my voice was scratchy. When I brought it up, he said I was exaggerating.
	‚Ä¢	In the mornings, he‚Äôd refuse to drive me to work unless we had sex. If I cried because I was tired or late, he‚Äôd call me names or threaten not to take me.
	‚Ä¢	During sex, if he couldn‚Äôt get aroused, he‚Äôd pinch me, pull my hair, call me degrading names. I‚Äôd cry, ask why he was mad. He‚Äôd blame me, call me a ‚Äúcheater‚Äù or a ‚Äúbitch.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	He climbed on top of me once and hit me in the head multiple times because I accidentally hit his eye with his pants while handing them to him.
	‚Ä¢	He drove erratically once, pulling my hair, saying we‚Äôd both die because I talked about leaving him. I had a panic attack while he was screaming.
	‚Ä¢	He choked me‚Äîmultiple times. Not for long, but long enough to terrify me.
	‚Ä¢	He wouldn‚Äôt let me go to the bathroom during sex. Wouldn‚Äôt let me stop even when I was crying. If he lost arousal, he‚Äôd pinch me, pull my hair, dig his nails into my skin.
	‚Ä¢	His cousin once overheard me crying naked during a fight and walked in to check. He got even angrier, blamed me for someone seeing me like that.

I hate admitting this, but I gave in to things a lot because I was afraid of what he‚Äôd do if I didn‚Äôt. When his brother was staying with us and sleeping in the same room, he‚Äôd make me have sex with him in the bathroom. It felt humiliating. But I didn‚Äôt know how to say no.

Early in our relationship, I think he did something sexual to me while I was half-asleep after getting high for the first time. I‚Äôve tried piecing it together, but it‚Äôs vague. Later, he started demanding sex even when I was crying. Sometimes, he wouldn‚Äôt pull out‚Äîjust to have control over me.

He made me feel like everything was my fault. He called me a slut, a bitch, accused me of cheating if I wanted to see friends or family. Meanwhile, he was the one cheating.

One time, neighbors called security because he was yelling, throwing me around, and I was crying. He screamed through the wall at them, calling them whores, saying he‚Äôd kill them. Afterward, he blamed me.

So Why Do I Still Feel Conflicted?

I know he has his own trauma. His own issues. A part of me still wants him to be okay. But I can‚Äôt shake how deeply wrong all of this feels.

I met my ex partner in April 2024 and we grew close very quickly. I thought he was the one. He saved me from my abusive family and him and his mother allowed me to move in with them after a horrible incident involving my cousin physically attacking both of us. My ex partner‚Äôs name is Heywood and he seemed very nice, until he showed his angry side. He was very sweet when he was in a good mood, but when angry he was a completely different person. He once drove his car recklessly while arguing with me and said if we crash it‚Äôs my fault, grabbed me by the neck multiple times, pushed me harshly to the point I flew across the hallway and blamed me for it, threatened to physically harm me and made himself look like he was going to do it just to scare and threaten me, grabbed me and held me, restricting my movement against my will, got beaten up by two guys in the middle of the night for putting his hands on me and blamed me for it happening and accused me of putting his life on the line because of it, threatened to take all my belongings from me and kick me out with absolutely nothing, and was verbally abusive and unsupportive, especially in times I was struggling with mental health and trauma. Told me to get over my trauma and the reason why I flew across the hallway in the first place was for opening up about it. He ended our relationship recently because I confronted him of continuing to follow someone on instagram who did something traumatic to me and I feel as if I was the problem. I have BPD and I understand having a borderline personality partner isn‚Äôt easy, I often got anxious and insecure in the relationship and would accuse him of not loving me and accused him of wanting to leave, but I was mostly very good to him.

Son born 2007
Married 2007
Daughter born 2011
Asked for divorce Sept 2020

I already left in fear because I knew who he was. However his duality, manipulation, and lies had me thinking we were splitting amicably. 

August 5th, 2021 while I was at work, he broke into my residence and waited for me to come home from my morning shift. He beat me with a baseball bat, had zip ties and duct tape, then stabbed me in the chest with a fixed blade hunting knife. Proceeding to hold me at gunpoint. 

I talked him out of killing me by telling him a story to tell police and that we would get back together. 

I was airlifted to a hospital 2 hours away. Knife barely missed my heart and lung.

He left a note, cash, kids birth certificates etc. at his place, evident he intended murder/suicide. 

I am stuck in a loop of doom. He is in prison until we 2029 and will be 56 years old. I am convinced he will ""come for me"". But that's so far from now!

I have no mother, and I cannot talk to my father about this because he ""took the exes side"" the whole year after I filed for divorce and moved out. Didn't get to go to Thanksgiving or Christmas with my DAD for the first time in my then 40 years because of his manipulative abilities. 

My current husband was my boyfriend at the time, and the first time he met my father and my son was at the hospital the day I almost died. 

I just feel like ""my people"" are tired of me being so.... stuck. My house is generally ""not clean""... I barely cook.... like WHEN will I get out of this loop? But they also don't want to hear about it anymore and I thought maybe unloading on willing strangers might help.

When anything happens in his games or with his friends, I'm always the one that has to deal with his yelling, cursing, throwing, slamming, and stomping. 

This ended up escalating when I couldn't pick him up from work one day since I was so nauseous I couldn't get out of bed. He came home angry, and when I asked him what's wrong he yelled, ""I can't feel my fucking fingers which is why I don't like to fucking walk!"" And threw his phone in my direction. Luckily, it missed my head by a few inches. (Also, for context there's a bus system he took before walking ten minutes to our home)


I've been slowly moving in to a new apartment, and it feels so freeing. I hope to be fully out in a few weeks when my coworker helps me get some of my bigger stuff and my pets. 

I feel like I should be feeling guilty right now like I have every time I upset him for years, but I just find myself feeling excited. I'll be leaving a note the day I leave telling him exactly why I left and to never contact me again (and I'll be changing my number).

I just can't wait for a peaceful new chapter. I'm sure I'll feel guilty and mourn when I'm finally out, though. ",,,

So this entire year, I've been worrying about how he's going to adjust. I've been worrying about things like him only having one parent (there is a no contact order that covers the kids), us not having the wealth other students there have, etc. 

I learned yesterday that he finished this year first in his class (75) academically and obtained the only perfect score on his Kindergarten readiness exam. 

I wanted to share because 1) sometimes it can feel like good news is few and far between in this chapter of life, and 2)  if you're like me when I was making the decision to leave, you are worried about whether the children will adjust okay.

I stayed with him for a while because he said he would change, but after a conversation with a friend I decided it couldn‚Äôt go on. 

She suggested that I just block him and possibly get a restraining order, but I still saw the good in him and didn‚Äôt feel right saying nothing, so I sent him a message explaining where I was coming from and telling him how much I loved him. I also grew close to his mom and she was abused by his father, so I sent her a message explaining things too. 

But I got so scared of leaving and worried for his safety I reached back out. He said he was upset, but that we could work it out. Then a few days later, he started berating me. He told me I was vile, vicious, cruel, that I shot him down like a dog, that he tried to kill himself and that it was my fault, that I‚Äôm horrible for not being patient with his progress. This went on for days. His mom also sided with him and hated me. He told me if I wanted things to work again I would have to put my all into being the perfect partner (or ‚Äòwife‚Äô as he worded it) and always put him and his mom first, even above myself.

I‚Äôve been trying to do what he said, always cooking for him, cleaning for him, almost completely taking over taking care of the dog, trying my best to sit patiently during his angry moments. My only solace would be an hour a day where I would go to the park to engage in my own joyful movement. I was exhausted from all this. But a few days ago he sat me down and told me that I wasn‚Äôt doing enough, that my time at the park was taking away from me doing things he enjoys, that he was dissatisfied and still angry and traumatized over me trying to leave. He said that he‚Äôs been doing too good to deserve this, that I could never find someone as good as him. This went on until 1am, he wouldn‚Äôt let me go to sleep until he was done. He started again the next morning, it got to the point I was curled up on the floor sobbing. Our poor dog was shaking and peed from fright, my bf just called him a ‚Äúpussy‚Äù. 

After all this, he started acting all sweet again and apologized for ‚Äòacting like a jerk‚Äô. Things are calm now, he‚Äôs acting sweet and loving again, but after the event I called a DV hotline and they are going to set me up with a legal advocate. But now I feel awful and scared to leave again. Is he right that I‚Äôm not being patient enough with his progress? He has grown in some ways that I‚Äôm proud of him for. But all this torment feels like punishment for me trying to leave, and I‚Äôm worried about our dog, even though our dog is very attached to my bf and my bf says he loves him. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy most of the time. Why does it feel so hard to leave? I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll miss the good.

He wants me completely moved into his apartment by the end of this month, and even wants to get married soon. We‚Äôve only been together for 6 months. I want to leave before all this happens, but I fear that I‚Äôm being unfair.",,,

Why. I spent 3 years of my life dedicated to him and our future.. I tried so hard to make him a better person because I felt awful knowing that our mutual friends hated the way he is.

I get so upset knowing that he‚Äôs out there with other women, either taking them on dates, sleeping with them in the same bed we used to hug each other in, or both. Why do I get like that? It‚Äôs like he forgot about me and all our moments together, all our plans we had for the future. I just hope these women don‚Äôt pet our cats.. Especially my little Jolyne. 

I‚Äôve been isolated from everyone. He won‚Äôt admit what he did wrong, he will never give me closure. I just want him to acknowledge the physical abuse he put me through on a near daily basis ‚Äî but I‚Äôm not sure if that will make me feel any better. He took everything I worked hard for, and now I‚Äôm homeless with nowhere to go. Maybe if I had kept my mouth shut then things wouldn‚Äôt be so bad.

I had a dream about him last night; we were in our home, on our bed. We shared the sweetest kiss, the ones I remember from the good times we shared together, and he held me in his arms. He told me he loved me, and then he stroked my hair. It felt so nice hearing his voice telling me sweet things. In that moment I felt loved.

These were my encounters that are signs of DV 

Emotional: 
- Cussing at me (using foul language in arguments) 
- Calling me horrible names (b*tch, c*nt, stupid, etc)
- Disregarding my feelings to make his feelings seem bigger 
- Telling me I shouldn‚Äôt wear more ‚Äúrevealing‚Äù clothes because I‚Äôd be seeking men‚Äôs attention
- Constantly asking ‚Äúwho I‚Äôm trying to look good for‚Äù anytime I‚Äôd put a little more makeup on than usual, or do my hair 
- Saying or doing awful things to me behind closed doors, but making me feel guilty and like I‚Äôm the bad guy if anyone found out about some of the things he said or did 

Physical:
- Isolating me from my friends by saying he doesn‚Äôt like them and trying to make them seem awful (and I‚Äôm not seeing it because they‚Äôre my friends) 
- Using scare tactics during arguments: furrowing brows, showing teeth, clenching jaw
- Yelling during arguments
- Escalation from slamming his hands down during arguments, to throwing items, to throwing items at me, to grabbing me, to throwing me onto bed and pinning me down 
- Also slapping me on occasion (but never the face) 
- Driving erratically with me in the car 

There are a lot of other things he‚Äôd say or do, smaller in detail, that I won‚Äôt list here. But if anyone has questions on if what they‚Äôre experiencing is DV, please reach out. I wish I found a post like this when I was experiencing it, because at the time I couldn‚Äôt decipher if what I was experiencing was normal or abusive.

It got tense I got scared I asked him to leave he wouldn‚Äôt we talked a little more he did stay calm but he was just acting like I was acting insane bc I was keeping my distance bc I was scared then I asked him to leave again still wouldn‚Äôt leave so I grabbed my phone my pepper spray and ran outside and asked why he wouldn‚Äôt respect me asking him to leave and he continued to sit on the couch and ask me to come back inside I said I had 911 ready to be called please leave this went on for like 5-10 mins before he eventually started leaving and saying if he left now he‚Äôd never talk to me again how I have no reason to be acting like this. Like I didn‚Äôt feel safe the night he strangled me he wouldn‚Äôt let me leave his house and this night he wouldn‚Äôt leave my house that was so triggering and he just acted like I don‚Äôt have trauma for what he did. And like really what would have happened if I went back in that house? What was his plan? Bc I was hysterical no meaningful conversation could be had at that point. Why couldn‚Äôt he just leave the first time I asked? This has to be my breaking point I can‚Äôt live like this. ",,,

I have left many times but always come back because I don't have money. I would like to get a job but I have to care for my 4 year old son. He is too young for full day kindergarten. I've looked no other free programs long enough to help. 

I am in a catch 22 because I need money to put him in daycare, but I need him in daycare before I can start working. I need money for gas but I need a car to get to work to make money. 

My husband enjoys keeping me trapped like this. Everytime I leave he cuts off my phone plan and car insurance to punish me. Since I need to live out of my car because there aren't shelters in my area, without gas money I can't sustain. 

I am waiting so patiently for my son to grow up so I can work but it's not coming soon enough. 

I take pictures everytime my husband leaves a mark on me. But my children witness everything and they have started mirroring our behavior and it makes me so sad. I need to get out. 

My family and his family have turned a blind eye. They tell me that I deserve it because I'm standing up for myself which is bad and I need to be a good submissive girl to my husband. If he beats me it's because I am not obeying him.

I have reached out to hundreds of people - lawyers, police, social workers, churches, friends, family, random strangers, the domestic hotline, been in domestic abuse shelters. But it all ends up in the same place. They tell me *I* have to leave. He won't change but *I* have to leave. Since his marks on me aren't bad enough to put him in jail for longer than a night, calling the police only makes things worse. I did that once and it made things worse. Unfortunately I just have to keep documenting and build a bigger case, or wait for him to beat me badly for police to lock him up for a long time, or wait for my son to grow up so I can get a job. 

My husband tells me once I get a job he will work less and make me pay for rent. But I will have to figure out how to not give him what he wants and just leave once I get enough money. I just have to prepare for that. 

I'm not looking for advice so much as just prayers I guess and validation. As I said I've talked to hundreds of people and they all said they can't help me, I have to help myself. ",,,

Ended a long-term relationship with someone who I really loved deeply, but unfortunately had not managed to work out his mental health/emotional abuse issues throughout our 4-year relationship. We were engaged but I postponed the engagement and then broke things off because he wouldn‚Äôt stop his behaviors, try hard enough to change, or seek therapy, no matter how many times I begged him to.

He never hit me or physically abused me but he had a huge anger problem (he has trauma and impulse control issues and grew up with abusive parents) and would yell at me, call me horrific names (swear words, insults, name-calling), dump me, threaten to leave me or end the relationships dozens of times, give me the silent treatment, throw things around the house, kick stuff, punch/slam his fists, break random things, etc. It was really stressful and caused me immense anguish and I asked him so many times to treat me better, he would apologize and be better for awhile until doing it again after a few weeks or months.

I eventually reached my breaking point when his last episode (involving him acting aggressive and screaming/throwing things around the house, but not at me) caused me a nervous breakdown. I was in a fight or fight mode and basically couldn‚Äôt function for weeks.

We broke up, but he‚Äôs recently been making a big effort to work on his mental health and says he will do anything to change and better himself as a human. He says he recognized the error in his ways, the abuse cycle, how he abused me, and is finally actually doing the things I asked him to do all those years. He is meditating every day, going to therapy, and his overall mood and demeanor seems to be very different. He says that me standing up to him and not taking his BS anymore has given him a massive wake-up call about how destructive his behaviors and mental health have been to him and to everyone around him. He says he wants to change and be a better version of him, not just for me, but for himself. He seems generally less reactive, angry, and explosive. I really love the calm, sweet side of him - the kind, caring side that‚Äôs not so tormented by his own trauma and rage. I miss this side, it‚Äôs who I fell in love with.

So we are in a limbo state. We broke up, but we are talking, so not exactly together but not fully apart either. I‚Äôm considering giving him another chance in a few months or so if I am convinced that he‚Äôs actually taking the right steps. I miss and love him dearly but I am still very unsure. We have talked about how I‚Äôm unsure, and how neither of us are in a place to go on dates with or sleeping with other people right now.

The thing is, over the past couple of months, about 3-4 men have hit on me/seemed to possibly express some level of interest in me (which hasn‚Äôt happened in years; I swear somehow men can sense if you‚Äôre not in a committed relationship!). One was an old friend from high school who ran into me, another was at a pizza place, and a coffee shop. I told my high school friend (we chatted for a bit and I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was flirting with me) that I‚Äôm open to friendship but not emotionally available to date (because of my complicated relationship situation). 

When a random guy around my age struck up a conversation with me at the coffee shop, I was friendly and chatted. I was not flirtatious, just nice and friendly as I would be to anyone talking to me, and had no idea if it was inappropriate of me to be talking with him. We didn‚Äôt talk about dating or anything inappropriate, just talked about the area, how there aren‚Äôt many people our age here (most people are much older than me and it can get lonely!), jobs, etc. I enjoyed talking with him but also felt so guilty about it. Was I leading him on? Being disloyal to my ex, who I have a complicated relationship with? I didn‚Äôt tell him about my complicated relationship status because it didn‚Äôt come up and it would have felt very awkward to mention it. He asked for my number to stay in touch and since we were having a friendly chat I gave it to him, as I have to other friends I‚Äôve met (I recently connected with a couple of women and gave them my number too). 

I can‚Äôt help but feel like I did something wrong and I feel so confused and icky about all of this. If the coffee shop guy asks me out on a date I‚Äôll just tell him that he seems like a genuinely cool person and I appreciate connecting as friends but I‚Äôm ending a complicated long-term relationship and not emotionally available to date right now. Was it wrong for me to talk with him? Should I have ignored him when he was friendly and approached me to say hi? Told him immediately that I have a boyfriend/partner (even tho I don‚Äôt)? Should I have refused to give him my number when he asked (I was conflicted but didn‚Äôt want to be rude to someone who was friendly)? All the work I do is virtual and I often feel so isolated and lonely these days, it‚Äôs nice having people be friendly to me. I would have also been thrilled if a woman my age approached me and gave me her number to stay in touch as friends.

I've been reading about the cycle of abuse, and I too watched my mum get abused.

I am with an abuser, but its my own fault. He doesn't really beg me to stay, he doesn't hold me captive. We don't have children together and we don't even live together. So why do I find it so hard to let go?

Last time we were together two weeks ago I was trying to play a game. He dropped his toast on the bed I was sitting on and I asked if he could clean it. He asked me to get up and I said I dont need to get up, he can just get a dustpan to clean it. He ended up throwing his toast at me. I told him he was acting childish and he ended up pouring an entire drink over my head. I locked myself in the bathroom after that until he left.

  
We've barely spoken since. This isn't the first time he has done something like this. But this time is different. Yes, I say this to myself every time. The abuse always changes. But this time, he didn't even say sorry. When we have spoken, he justifies his behaviour. He said I shouldn't have called him names. He said he would do it again. I was disgusted when he said this. To go back would be me saying ""I give you permission to abuse me.""

Yet I know, when I will be lonely, which happens often as I don't have any friends, I will think of him. I will idolise the good parts in our relationship, which is literally just him accepting me for who I am - Someone who's done mostly nothing with their life.

How do I stop? Has anyone else felt this way? Am I the only person who cant let go of being repeatedly abused just because of 1 good day in a month? What is wrong with me?",,,

I was doing pretty good, spending time with friends, going out more and taking back my control. However this week it's been...rough.

Sure, I occasionally had flashbacks and heard him call me stupid, all the favorite curse words (b***h, c**t, w***e, etc), all the verbal abuse and assaults and it didn't bug me as much. But this week has been rough with it amping up to the point where my nightmares came back and having panic attacks at work just being near the men. It's just been so bad and like...I knew it'd happen, but I didn't expect it to get this bad after 6 months of leaving. 

My question is, does it get better? With handling the flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety of being found? What does healing look like? I'm in therapy, there's a safety plan enforced at my job who's aware of the situation, I'm with friends and enjoying my hobbies again and relying on my support group but...I don't even know what HEALED looks like, or at least healing progress. Will it ever get better? I don't miss him, nor do I ever want to go back especially since my life would be at risk, but I just want to know if it'll get better and what does ""better"" even look like with everything that has happened?

Our relationship has been on and off for about a year and a half. We met August 2023, moved in together in November 2023, lived together until March 2024, when I moved back to my parents house because the abuse was too much. I was hospitalized for SI in December, 2023 and tried to kms in February 2024. 

He moved to be closer to me (my parents were in a different state then where we lived). It had always just been emotional and verbal abuse but now he was getting more aggressive. Once he lunged across the bed at me because I was trying to leave. Another time he wanted me to leave and I was waiting for my mom in the living room and he pushed me and then picked me up and dragged me outside, slammed the door in my face and then came out the side door to continue yelling at me. 

I've been trying to break up with him for a long time but I always miss him.

This time was different because I actually reported him to the police after he sent nudes of me to people and said he was going to kill me if I didn't answer his call. (I was really trying to move on and he didn't like that)

But I still miss him. I want someone to hold me and to love me, and when he wasn't abusive he made me feel so loved and not alone. 

I feel guilty that I'm ruining his life by pressing charges against him and I'm overreacting to the situation because he didn't actually hurt me he just said he would. 

I also feel like I can't say I'm a domestic violence victim because he didn't actually hurt me.

Disclaimer: I am writing about a situation of my relative because her reddit is being actively monitored by her abuser. I will be able to call her to share comments. 

I do not know all the details and their history of the abuse, I only know that ‚Äúit was not that bad before‚Äù and that it has rapidly escalated about a month ago - that‚Äôs when she reached out to me for help. He hit and strangled her several times, there are photos of bruises on her neck and recordings of conversation that lead to one of the attacks.

She is ready to leave this weekend while he is at work. She has most basics packed, some cash stashed, and a temporary housing arranged in a different city. She, however, feels uneasy about leaving unannounced. She wants to somehow let him know that she left. She is convinced that it isn‚Äôt a big deal because the abuser is only physically violent when he is drunk. She says she only expects him to be verbally aggressive.

I think it is a bad idea because what if her farewell causes things to escalate even more? He is a very strong man and she is a physically sick weak woman. There is absolutely no way she can fight back if he attacks her again. I believe she is not dead only because he let her live.

I need some tips/advice please.",,,

So, I came on here to talk about being in the ER, and leaving my son‚Äôs dad‚Ä¶ My abuser.

I spoke with a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who ended up blaming me :( she said ‚Äúwhy do you keep allowing him the space to hit you?‚Äù :/ then she told me to ‚Äúmace him‚Äù and I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs illegal‚Äù (the state we live in isn‚Äôt a stand your ground state) and she says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù then, one thing that gets to me is the, ‚Äúif it were me‚Ä¶‚Äù because if it were YOU (or her) she would act however she‚Äôll act but I‚Äôm not her and she isn‚Äôt me. Our lifestyles are different too. I‚Äôm a full time stay at home mom and I rely on my abuser‚Äôs income. She‚Äôs a mom too but she works‚Äî she‚Äôs a flight attendant so she gets to travel too. When she was a stay at home mom, she was a lot more compassionate, but now she‚Äôs back to who she was before, and she feels good about herself. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ a mom‚Ä¶ trying to survive. It makes me not want to talk about it. I don‚Äôt have the income to leave in a flash but I have a plan! And my plan is in motion, just because people don‚Äôt see it at lighting speed doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not happening BUT I HATE THAT TOO!!!! That I feel like I have to explain myself :/ but no one asks him to explain why he‚Äôs abusive. I felt good prior to speaking with her, like, I was ready to talk about it but now I just don‚Äôt want to talk to people I know. I feel safer with y‚Äôall, strangers on the internet, than friends. I have no tangible community.",,,

I just want to share solitude and love to everyone that‚Äôs either healing after leaving, contemplating how to escape, and those that are unfortunately just experiencing the horrific behavior of our abusers. You matter, this is not your fault, and you absolutely are worthy of safety. Abuse can make us feel less than, because an abusive person‚Äôs low self-esteem encourages them to hurt us. Even though it may be difficult, I want you to know for a solid fact, you DO deserve more and you‚Äôre sooooo special. You light up the room when you walk in, you make someone happy that you‚Äôre alive, and there are people wishing for a you. 

What I‚Äôve come to understand is that these abusers really hate themselves and their lives, so they try to reconcile that by being horrible to others. They believe this false sense of superiority and it‚Äôs just making them worse off. Even if you‚Äôre standing up for yourself, that‚Äôs still not a reason for you to be abused. I don‚Äôt care what they try to tell you. I still battle with the guilt of leaving people I really loved, but I‚Äôd rather be safe and offered genuine love than fearing the next form of abuse. I‚Äôm not saying you won‚Äôt be scared after escaping, but at least you have the certainty of yourself and no one attacking you every chance they get. These people are not on the same emotional and mental level as us, whereas we try to do good in the world and work on ourselves.

I used to cry because the person I loved so deeply kept actively choosing to tear me down and abuse me, despite me begging, presenting healthy connection tactics, praying, offering them spiritual advice, and reasoning with ‚Äúa potential justified cause‚Äù of this behavior. Multiple times and it unfortunately had been happening this way my entire life. I urge you to find good community and expose yourself to a healthy relationship. You‚Äôll see so quickly the red flags that they‚Äôd manipulated to look like slight yellows and light greens in the beginning or throughout the relationship.

I get hesitant to write about the very real experience, because I get watched online. That‚Äôs the worst part about it. I will never understand how someone could choose to hurt you, so you feel unwanted. But when you leave and seek support they even know you deserve, they either watch you or have people do it for them. Blasphemous. It just speaks to the fact that you do not deserve this. Over the past 4-5 years, my abusers have stalked me and continually harassed me with post-relational abuse, even though I let them be and chose to heal in private. You don‚Äôt have to. You can be as loud about your pain as you need, because you suffer in silence. You deserve to heal. You deserve to smile. You deserve true love.

I watched a video this morning of a girl about to marry a man that wasn‚Äôt even sure of her and now, she‚Äôs marrying a very good man, who believes her to be his best friend and the true love of his life. The reality is, unlike what some of us have heard similarly but were never treated right, this man was all about his talk. So, I say this to say that your love is waiting for you in SO many forms, please know it‚Äôs possible for each of us. TRUE Love finds you in the ways that you need the most throughout life, and it‚Äôll never make you feel confused. Not about yourself of anything else. It‚Äôll be the most certain and safest experience you‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôm wishing the best for you all. 

If you ever need emotional support or affirmations, please contact me! Xo",,,
1jablxw,He has a drinking problem and is kicking me out,NoPractice111,3,2025-03-13 13:11:19+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jablxw/he_has_a_drinking_problem_and_is_kicking_me_out/,"Hi friends, not sure if this is the right subreddit but I‚Äôm grasping at straws here. 
A little backstory:
My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months. We met off Tinder, but went to the same high school and have many mutual friends. After our first date, he was constantly trying to go on more dates with me and I was enamored; the connection was there. We began dating shortly after and he moved into a new house that needed some help fixing up. I helped him fix the house, and at that point I was spending so much time there that he was begging me to move in with him. Everything was great so far, so I figured why not. Through the months I met his whole family and I loved them, they accepted me as one of their own. We talked about marriage, having kids, how we‚Äôre both ready to settle down and have a family. 

We eventually moved into a new house (renting) and that‚Äôs when things started to take a turn. He started drinking, and he‚Äôs not the kind of person who can handle it. He doesn‚Äôt know when to stop. He will drink until he is belligerent and a completely different person. Usually when he gets that drunk, he will start an argument with me and try to pack up his things so he can leave. I never let him drive like that, so he‚Äôs never actually left. Every day after a fight like that‚Äôll, we always talk about how he has a problem with drinking and he‚Äôs going to stop. The usual. At first the fights were a month or two apart. And then it was every two weeks. This week it‚Äôs already happened twice. 

Last night after he lied to get me out of the house, he made me sit at a bar with him and his friend while he got drunk, and refused to let me drive his car. He then drove to drop his friend off, and then sat in his driveway with him for 3 hours drinking close to 18 beers while I sat there and twiddled my thumbs. My phone was dead at this point and I couldn‚Äôt do anything. Then he tries to leave. He can barely walk, can‚Äôt speak a coherent sentence, and wants to drive. At this point I‚Äôm crying, begging him to let me drive because I am stone cold sober. My best friend died from being in the car with a drunk driver and I am extremely uneasy about the situation. He refuses, rips out of the driveway, and takes down his friend‚Äôs mailbox. He severely damages the side of his car, gets a flat, and knocks off his side mirror in one go. He has to pull over and tells me to get a ride. My phone is dead, he will not let me use his. It is 1am. He starts calling me toxic for trying to control his drinking, and breaks up with me. 

I sit here now in our shared house and I am unsure what to do. I have no money to my name. He hasn‚Äôt let me have our (private) landlord‚Äôs number this whole time, and is saying he‚Äôs calling her to tell her I need to leave. All of my things are here and I have nowhere to go. I have also paid 40% of the rent this month which is good for 24 more days. Can he legally kick me out with no warning period..? Not that I want to stay, but I do need somewhere to rest my head while I figure out my next steps. I really am just at a loss. I got a concussion a few days ago (unrelated) and that, mixed with the emotions of what is going on is rendering me unable to think. 

TLDR; (now ex) boyfriend is trying to kick me out of a house that I have paid 40% of rent for, effective immediately.",,,

Well the last couple instances i find myself wishing i could have someone that makes me feel safe. Wishing i could experience a normal relationship before i die. Thinking about what i have to offer outside of the pain i carry etc. is this unhealthy? I have kids and haven‚Äôt even left yet and no job or family to go to. Why the change in my thoughts?

I don‚Äôt really know if my feelings are valid or if i really am being controlling and crazy. I‚Äôm very confused. 

We moved to a new place to disconnect from the city and the corporate world after he had a mental breakdown (justifiable) *insert terrible act of injustice that he suffered*Husband said he‚Äôs not gonna make any friends or be his very outgoing bubbly self. We argued about this as i thought it incredibly unrealistic and he tends to have these dramatic introspective (but not actually solving the real problem) episodes. Anyways He‚Äôs a smart,funny, humble relatable guy and people flock to him when he shows this side. We went through a very rough patch where he determined he was gonna spend a lot of time rebuilding broken pieces of our relationship and emphasized spending all our time together. He would say that if he could find a place cheap enough he‚Äôd not go back to work and we would just spend time together. It was a hard time for me. I do enjoy spending all my time with him but he was having frequent episodes of anger and distress about large scale/macro things like economics or religion, government corruption etc. all things i can‚Äôt solve but have to listen to and not piss him off with an opinion he doesn‚Äôt like. Fast forward we are here and he‚Äôs very outgoing making friends with everyone and constantly cracking jokes and making everyone smile. He‚Äôs fast tracking his way into every friendship that comes up. He drops our religion of 4 years and the friends we made with it. He did have valid reasons for the friendships and valid issues with the religion that can‚Äôt be ignored but he did it abruptly and we have kids. There was no drinking, no smoking, no cursing,  now he does all three simultaneously. He says people change and went from us being a team and me being ‚Äúthe most important thing in his life‚Äù to me being a bitch thst doesn‚Äôt allow him to grow  as a person. People change over time. I‚Äôd bring up that not everyone is a good look for a friend. People that are drinking alot and using vulgar language a lot aren‚Äôt the people we want to attach to at this stage in our lives with young kids and goals to be better and do better. But when i try to talk about this he says I‚Äôm crazy. I feel like he switches up too often and i have nothing that i can count on as a stable trait of his. I feel very insecure in the instability. I‚Äôll try to express it, he will deny deny deny and the. He will eventually say something mean and off topic. Or even bring up a reason why I‚Äôm stupid in comparison to him and then it just all goes to shit and I‚Äôm calling him vindictive and abusive. And he‚Äôs telling me that the thing that angers him most and that I‚Äôm basically asking for it when i call him those names. He has a rule that i can‚Äôt track his character or he will lose it. What a mess.

1ja0anb,My 4 year relationship with my BPD ex fianc√©.,Cam9101,2,2025-03-13 01:12:23+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ja0anb/my_4_year_relationship_with_my_bpd_ex_fianc√©/,"I have recently left a 4 year relationship. A very very bad, abusive in the final year, relationship that ended with me with my father and her with the friends she constantly complained to me about.

When we separated it was after she dumped filthy cat litter on my head that I had to clean from my hair for 2 days. She would often throw glass and ceramic, pans, etc but glass was always broken when she snapped. 

She has BPD in the 2nd degree and has been cheated on before which is why I always tried to be open and honest with her. It got to the point in year 2 we just couldn't make things work and we took time from each other. Foolishly I allowed myself to have sex with two women in two days because I was scared and destroyed mentally. My last relationship ended similar to how it was going and I spiraled, which I did voice to her but it's no excuse for my actions in weakness. After that I promised I'd tell her when we got back together. 

This unfortunately came at a bad time because she would eventually ask me if I had done anything while we were apart. Yes I had but at the time I know she couldn't handle if I just came out and said it; so I lied. To this day its the only lie I've ever told her but she would eventually go through my phone with the passcode I gave her because I didn't mind her going through my phone and she discovers the messages from 1 of the women and she proceeds to toss my ps5 and throw me out of her place, I was staying at college during this time. I wanted to leave and keep the 2nd secret but I'm not a liar so I told her about the second. I embarrassingly banged on her door to no avail for 30 minutes , she would take me back like 2 weeks later.

Yet people with BPD have a hard time coping with betrayal especially from those who they live dearly. 

From that point on she saw me as not ""black"" or ""white"" but a grey area ""what will I do next"". ((I allowed her to have my passcode and passwords after this.)) Our relationship deteriorated slowly for the next two years she'd call me a b word often, blame-shift, accuse, deny feeling uncomfortable or down, accuse me of babying her by acknowledging her illness when she would demean herself, and in the last year hit me, hate me, deny me sex, deny me her presence, run to her friends she claimed to be upset with all the time and even doing petty things like unplugging the wifi box and throwing water on me. What scared me the most and when I knew it was over was when she threatened to break my glasses, I'm virtually blind without them. I also have had the cops called on me 3 times in her rages when I held her down to not cut herself on glass I ALWAYS HAD TO CLEAN.

I hated her friends after a while because they were like her and I tried to understand why they disliked me so much but it's because she never after going off to them about me, went back and fixed the wrong things she said. She accused me of sabotaging her car after we split even though she scratched mine and also broke 2 of my TVs

I hate that her life will be easy because I know it will. She doesn't feel my pain; last message I sent her was about a month ago, a final goodbye and she just called me weird and I apologized. I still think of her often her voice, the gap of her teeth, her sad face, her joy eating my food. I wish I could forget her moans, we were so in tune or so I thought and now someone else will have her. She's pretty, has a fat ass, dresses decently and is bisexual(that's a little joke). No but seriously she's with her friends now and I'm sure they're out there blaming me and having the world fall at their feet.

I hate all of her friends but one the most and I'll say his name Max. He's a trans man who we both(me and my ex fianc√©)wanted to at a certain point have a threesome with okay cool cool. We ended up falling out multiple time because my ex fianc√© would come home and complain to me about him and I had enough but you can't ever make someone drop their friends; this friend was bad for them, still I let it go. We tried to make up and we're in his words ""associates"" at the time he asked me this question no bs ""do you want to watch my partner and my ex fianc√© naked cooking for us on valentines. I was like that's cool and all and we continued to talk more and he eventually said we aren't friends and I was like but you legit just asked to see my partner naked in a kitchen gown? 

My ex fianc√© would never take my side against her friends I even went off on two of them like 3 times before I called it quits trying to help that way.

so she would eventually conceal problems she had with her friends. This would make her feel as if well ""if I don't want to talk to him about something I don't have to"" I SHOULD'VE LEFT THEN. Communication became shoddy and eventually we wouldn't even interact anymore for weeks and even texting became mundane and she'd block me on social media and not post me or follow me often. It became embarrassing to post the pictures over and over. 

A month before we separated I sexted a girl one night on Snapchat and in my soul I knew I knew she was coming to check my phone because I had changed the passcode on my phone earlier in the day so she could see me struggle to put my passcode in. I hate that we separated but I just couldn't take being ignored anymore I deserved better so I left my phone on the charger woke up to her accusing me of cheating the entire time, keep in mind she hadn't come into my room to see me for about a month and a half towards the end of our last year together. I just didn't care anymore. I didn't consider us together at that point she would block me and go to her friends often our last kiss was in a Wendy's parking lot where I ""struggled"" with my passcode.

If any partner refuses to communicate LEAVE, you don't know what you don't know.

I'm happy it ended but I hate being without her no one will take the time I did with her. I was 19 when we began I am 23 now. We lived together in our own place for 2 years and had 2 cats that she took in the end she now lives with her friend and I'm ruined. ",,,

No family no close friends. A ridiculous amount of context here, but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs important anymore.

My husband has severe mental health struggles, and it‚Äôs taken a huge toll on our marriage. The breaking point for him was losing a brutal custody battle for his child. The forensic psychiatrist and guardian ad litem both recommended we get custody, but the judge ruled against us, leaving his daughter with her mother. He had documented abuse from his ex and even had her father testify against her, but nothing changed.

After that, he completely unraveled‚Äîshaving his head in a rage, quitting his job, blowing all our money, and putting us into debt until we had to sell our home. His ex-wife was a constant source of stress and conflict, and even after winning, she continued making life difficult.

The Abuse and Escalation

During this time, he became emotionally and verbally abusive‚Äîchasing me around the house, screaming in my face, demanding that I hit him, and then cycling through apologies before doing it all over again. His best friend even stayed with us and told me I should leave but didn‚Äôt want to say too much because they‚Äôre childhood friends.

This isn‚Äôt new behavior. Early in our relationship, I hit him first during an argument while drunk. Police were there for the music being loud and he told me to go into one of the rooms. I said no, he grabbed my arm and i punched him in the face. To stop me he punched me several times, and I briefly lost consciousness. I carried guilt for this and still believe I was at fault. You shouldn‚Äôt hit anyone unless you have to, right? And i despise women who hit men because they know that they can‚Äôt hit them back. I‚Äôm very remorseful and ashamed about it. A year Later, we had a heated argument over something trivial (whether robots can have emotions), and when I tried to walk away, he grabbed me by the neck, threw me on the bed, and choked me.

For years, he told me I was the reason he screamed and that I needed to ‚Äúlearn to shut up.‚Äù He said if I attacked his character (calling him crazy, pointing out overreactions, saying he was a bad friend or a bad person), he would react aggressively. I internalized this and tried to be careful, but no matter what I did, if he was in the mood to rage, he would. He once dragged me across the floor, crouched over me, screaming in my face‚Äîdespite me following every rule he set for how I should respond to his outbursts. I brought this to his attention several times and no explanation. He gave me all these things i better not do because it‚Äôll provoke him and nothing worked? 



In December of last year We moved to a farm for a fresh start, selling our house and getting an RV. I handled the financial mess he created, even had to sue a contractor who ran off with our money, and made the transition happen. Everything outside of us is wonderful here, but inside our marriage, things have gotten worse.

Religious Shift & More Instability

We had converted to Islam four years ago, and it brought a lot of stability. Then suddenly, after moving, he abandoned the faith, started drinking, smoking, and engaging in inappropriate conversations with coworkers. I told him I was uncomfortable, but he dismissed me as controlling. He often takes me with him to hang out. Maybe like 70% of the time I‚Äôm with him and he‚Äôs actively engaging me and making me a part of the socialization. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm sitting on the side. He says people just feel comfortable around us and think we are cool so they just spill their guts which is just not appropriate and i rather not participate because it all sounds like mess. Drama and mess and inappropriate context. 

But before the farm these instances happened -

One night after a fight, he went to the train tracks and said he was going to kill himself. Another time, he choked me because I stayed up late working as an admin for a friend‚Äôs religious YouTube channel. He called me a ‚Äúpiece of sh*t‚Äù for not prioritizing his feelings over that, even though he was asleep when I started working. After that, he checked himself into a mental institution.

His behavior swings between suicidal, homicidal, or being the sweetest, most loving man. He has moments where he‚Äôs completely devoted, then suddenly shuts me out. He has extreme attunement skills, gives me his undivided attention, wants to be around me 24/7.

After we got to the farm,

Over the religious conversation where i brought my concerns to him about the drastic change and what to tell the kids and how uncomfortable i am with feeling like he ripped everything away, he yelled and kicked me and the kids out of the rv. It took me some times to pack and when we got on the road he text saying to comeback and that hes got to start putting the kids first and that we can live together and maybe something will change in the future. So i came back. 

Now last night we go to a neighbors to sit springs the fire and that neighbor and another neighbor want to talk about sexual stuff. In particular one wanted to talk a bit how he was sexually harassed by a girl who just recently moved back and the other neighbor thought it was funny and just egged it on etc. i was just kinda sitting there nervous chuckling and wishing i was dead. I am modest in nature and he knows that and has promised to keep certain boundaries in agreeance with me. But then he decided not to and there‚Äôs no discussion. He did tell them to steer the conversation in another direction and they didn‚Äôt and i know he can‚Äôt control other adults but i see groups around the farm and this one they constantly talks bad about other people and talks about sexual stuff isn‚Äôt the one i war to be a regular member of nor does it align with anything we planned or promised each other and he acts like im just controlling. Maybe he‚Äôs right? Idk. Well we went home and i said nothing and we enjoyed the rest of our night and i was sweet to him just trying tk ans sense of everything ur j was quiet this morning. He said he was going i. Late so he could help around the house. One of those moments where he‚Äôs like the best husband ever and this does happen regularly.  But i was short and kind of melancholy so he jerk asking what wrong and i kept saying i didn‚Äôt wanna talk about it and that it‚Äôs not an emergency or anything.  After i took the laundry to the laundry room we stepped outside and i told him idk if i really want to be at this farm anymore. I‚Äôve earned him about his overly inviting behavior and how we have opportunity to build friendships with people who hold the same values and he‚Äôs slowly but surely pushing us into the drinking, smoking, cussing , vulgar group despite us being invited to a birthday with managers and owners only and not that that makes them good people by they‚Äôre wholesome and have good habits and that‚Äôs what they want. They could‚Äôve been the Janitor, mailman, chef, poop scooper and i would‚Äôve been happy if they all aligned with us on what‚Äôs important and valued family and doing good. Anyways he listened and then said that he tried to steer the conversation but can‚Äôt control that they do. I told him that i get that but it‚Äôs not about this conversation it‚Äôs about boundaries. I don‚Äôt have people coming up to me telling me who they screwed last night because I‚Äôve established boundaries. He says that means he can‚Äôt talk to anyone at all and I‚Äôm controlling him. I tell him i don‚Äôt want to talk anymore and I‚Äôm going to let the kids know I‚Äôm driving him a cross the street and he says ‚Äúwe already told them, you remember all that‚Äôs hit but can‚Äôt remember that we told them‚Äù

So i get pissed because he does this when the conversion isn‚Äôt going in his favor. He starts jabbing at me so i tell him that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs doing right now ant to stop and he starts yelling and escalating and telling me to just drop him off because he‚Äôs done. So now im emotional and telling him im too old for this shit anymore. And he tells me I‚Äôm crazy and to pull over and let him out of the car on the side of the highway and i say no there‚Äôs 2 semi trucks behind us and he grabs the steering wheel and out his foot in the driver area to press the break. I let him out and drive off then i stop and call him and tell him he better get back in the car because he‚Äôs gonna hear me and that he doesn‚Äôt shit every time. He gets the spotlight off the issue and then just fights with me so he gets in the car and i yell at him and say I‚Äôm tired of this cycle and i didn‚Äôt even want to talk because i knew it would end this way and i said he didn‚Äôt do what he should to avoid boundaries and at that moment he screamed to let him out because im not recognizing that he said to steer the conversation which was him establishing a boundary that the neighbors just didn‚Äôt respect.
He choked me and punched me in the face, grabbed the steering wheel, put his foot down in the driver pedal area. And i called 911. A manger from his job pulled up to see if we were ok and he told them i was holding him hostage and i told him that he punched  me in my face. I‚Äôve never called 911 before despite all the previous instances. 
I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs relevant anymore. I‚Äôm so exhausted and have been for a long time.  

Every time this happens i feel immediate guilt and wish i had said nothing or said the right things. I almost always crumble first. He‚Äôs been my best friend for so long and in such a derp level that i just feel like i can‚Äôt breathe if we are at odds. We have been through alot and faced alot together and even have a 4 year old ",,,

He was originally going to take a plea deal but could not attend the mandated DV classes due to starting a new job apparently.  The prosecutor refused to accommodate him and change the plea deal so the case is going to trial. I just found out today after expecting this to be over. 

I‚Äôm so scared the judge won‚Äôt believe me. It‚Äôs my word against his. I went to the police a week later after staying at his apartment multiple days after the assault and I feel dumb. The only charge is obstruction of breathing because he put his fingers down my throat which impeded my breathing. There is no way to prove this. I did go to the doctor a week later and was diagnosed with a concussion. I submitted photos of my hair pulled out along with a photo of my lip bleeding after the assault. These photos were taken at his apartment after the assault. 

He had submitted security cam footage from the camera that was in his room when it happened as evidence it ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt happen‚Äù. He cut out part of the video (obviously when he tackled me to the ground), the prosecutor found out after examining the footage. That part obviously does not make him look good but it doesn‚Äôt prove that he did anything. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some reassurance and positive words. ",,,

This occurrence I started the fight by being angry, he threw me on the couch and strangled me and I ran into the corner, and he followed and I hit him twice in the face.  He blocked me on everything and kicked me out. Not proud of my actions. Im wondering if I file a report the case would fall back on me since I hit him.

I have BPD and can be difficult with my insecurities and anxiety and had many many episodes but i know he shouldnt of hurt me physically

 I've sent really nasty messages a month prior lmao threatening to slash his tires if he cheated on me- call me crazy- I never did it lol but idk if those would fall on me or irrelevant.

For context: I moved into my apartment about a year ago and I live next to a couple. I have repeatedly heard the man scream at her and call her disgusting names. About a week ago I heard a bang against the wall followed by him yelling obscenities at her and I called the police because I was concerned that he had either punched the wall, or that he had slammed her against the wall. Today I heard him screaming his head off yet again calling her a stupid bitch and telling her to shut the fuck up and I decided to call the police again and explain that I called the other night. When they showed up today, I watched through my peep hole and they spoke to her for a while and then I don‚Äôt know how but she ended up getting arrested instead and she started crying as the cops took her away in cuffs.",,,

When we got home i got changed into some shorts and a t shirt, i vaguely remember being half on the bed and half off like my legs off still stood up and him coming up behind me pulling my shorts down and well yeah, when he finished he told me i had bled and he left to clean up- i remember crying but stopping before he came back in and when he did he asked me like a dozen times if i was okay. The next day i brought it up explaining i hadn‚Äôt said yes and he told me i‚Äôd just repeated idk to him and that i didn‚Äôt say no. i‚Äôm not entirely sure i understand what happened to me, if something happened to me. 

edit- i can confirm i wasn‚Äôt roofied however i was on medication which made drinking hit harder it was one of the reasons i hadn‚Äôt drank in a while i wasnt blackout but i was definitely not sober id say i was probably like a 7/10 drunk. i think i ended up drinking a bottle of 9% wine then i also had a lot of shots of vodka, captain jacks and malibu we had been playing drinking games and beer pong but with vodka and captain jacks as the mixer. I‚Äôve also woken up sometimes to him touching me down there over and under my pants before but he‚Äôs pulled away the moment ive woken up and pushed his hands away i just feel i should mention this as well.

1j9s6uj,So many lies - how to regain trust in myself,Electrical-Heron-619,3,2025-03-12 19:13:33+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j9s6uj/so_many_lies_how_to_regain_trust_in_myself/,"I just found out he lied about his daughter having (possibly terminal) cancer to keep me around and get money out of me that it turns out he probably used for drugs.

He moved to my country and lived with me for the last 2 months we were together (he‚Äôs gone now thankfully). There had been red flags when we were together in another country but I was in a vulnerable state and made excuses for his behaviour. The abuse ramped up when he was here and was pretty constant - controlling, jealous, manipulative, verbally and emotionally abusive and would smash things in anger. The night I left he came close to attacking me and threatened to badly harm himself in front of me. 

It‚Äôs been heavy unpacking since then and realising all the patterns. 

At one point I‚Äôd tried to put my foot down, he seemed to be having more self control, then one night reverted and it was bad and worse from there. He had told me that night was because he‚Äôd found out his daughter (w her mom in his home country) was very ill. He‚Äôd been unable to get a work permit so even though I‚Äôm currently unemployed we were living off what little I had. I gave him extra money ‚Äúto send back for cancer screening tests‚Äù and from there he claimed it was leukaemia and likely terminal and he needed ‚Ç¨400 for chemo. I was broke so maintained I couldn‚Äôt help but felt awful.

After I kicked him out and he want back to his country, I found a crack pipe in my place. He claimed he never used it and hadn‚Äôt used in 5 years (long before we‚Äôd met).

His mom contacted me today, he‚Äôd stabbed himself in the leg aiming for his artery and she was saying she wants to get him help. First time she spoke to me openly in confidence - it was quickly clear he‚Äôd lied to her about me shutting him out and I took the chance to ask about his daughter as the ‚Äúfacts‚Äù had gotten very confusing. Suffice to say it was all a lie and (thankfully for her) his daughter is fine. He‚Äôd been using since getting back there so was probably using the extra money while here for drugs.

I can‚Äôt believed I shared a bed with this guy. I worked for decades to learn to trust people and he‚Äôs stolen so much of that progress from me. He lied about his own daughter being terminally ill just to trick me into staying with him, put up with his abuse and give him drug money. 

I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm out and fought the first moments of reconsidering, but it‚Äôs just so sad. And now I‚Äôm so isolated all this came out today including getting sent a picture of his leg covered in blood and I‚Äôve no one in this city I feel I can ask to keep me company this evening or just give me a hug as so many of my friendships have become so much more distant. 

Feeling really alone and sad rn so thanks to anyone for reading and just want to skip all these realisations and be over this saga already. ",,,

I didn't talk to my mom from age 11 to age, probably 34 because of a nasty divorce where she hit me when I was a kid. 

Fast forward, now we are on okay terms and my daughter stays with her from time to time. 

She confided in me that her she doesn't want to call him boyfriend, but guy that lives with her occasionally hits her when he gets angry. 

She will not call the cops. She's the type of person that doesn't have a cell phone. Just a landline and lives in the middle of nowhere. No internet etc. 

I felt like if I was closer to her I would probably just handle him myself. He's not a very tough guy. I could lift more weights than him when I was 11 if that gives any context. 

I don't want to get in legal trouble. I'm not sure where to go from here. I also don't want to confront him and then have him kill her later after I'm gone. 

He's a real looked up too guy in their community as well. Church going religious nut.

We, the undersigned, call on Congress to pass the Justice Without Time Limits Act, which would eliminate the statute of limitations for rape and domestic violence cases resulting in injury. Survivors deserve the right to seek justice, no matter how much time has passed.
 
Why This Matters:
 Many survivors delay reporting due to trauma, fear, or systemic failures in law enforcement.
 Thousands of rape kits remain untested across the country, allowing perpetrators to walk free.
 Advances in forensic DNA technology allow cases to be solved even decades later.
Survivors own their DNA and deserve access to rape kit results upon request.
No perpetrator should evade justice simply because of an arbitrary legal time limit.
 
We Demand:
The elimination of the statute of limitations for rape and domestic violence injuries at the federal and state level in the United States.
Mandatory rape kit testing and a national rape kit tracking system.
The right for survivors to access their DNA test results without obstruction.
 Special Victims Units (SVUs) in every law enforcement agency, ensuring trained officers handle these cases properly.
 
Justice should never expire. We urge Congress to take immediate action by sponsoring and passing the Justice Without Time Limits Act. Survivors deserve better.
 
Sign this petition and demand justice today!

I want to break up so badly but I care deeply for him. So deeply in fact that I‚Äôve sacrificed my needs and self worth for the entirety of our relationship. 

We got together in August of 2022, I was 17F and he was 22M. We‚Äôre now 20F, 25M. I thought he was perfect, everything I‚Äôd ever needed as I have not had a good history of  ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù. I consider him my first everything.

It didn‚Äôt stay perfect for long. 2-3mo in he started cheating on me and starting physically altercations and it only got worse from there. I was naive and thought if I loved him the way I wanted him to love me, I‚Äôd fix him. 

In January of 2024, I found out I was pregnant. He demanded I get an abortion, his family even offered to pay for it. I told him no and that if he wants he can be a deadbeat bum and pay for child support. Somehow I forgave him and let him stay. 

He was good during my pregnancy until he wasn‚Äôt. He was getting off to people behind my back and there were 2 times during my pregnancy that I felt my life may had been in jeopardy. I haven‚Äôt told anyone about those 2 incidents. I forgave him, believing he‚Äôd never do it again. But it wracks my brain every single day.

He was so sweet, caring and gentle during the birth of our daughter. Yet somehow still found time 5 days after giving birth to like p0rn on FB of a pregnant woman after refusing intimacy with me during my pregnancy. The incidents that happened during my pregnancy and postpartum have scarred me mentally and feel truly unforgivable‚Ä¶ 

The last time he has done anytbing to jeopardize our relationship that I know of was a month ago. I told him that was my last straw. I tried to forgive him but all of this has added up tremendously. The problem is, I believe he genuinely has changed in this past month. He‚Äôs everything I waited for him to be for so long but I can‚Äôt forget the past. I can‚Äôt trust him fully. I fantasize about being and living alone every single day. Raising my daughter alone, with me. It is effecting me deeply to feel like by staying, I‚Äôm playing with his emotions and his head/giving him false hope‚Ä¶ I care for him deeply but I don‚Äôt know if I love him romantically anymore. Thinking of marriage makes my stomach turn‚Ä¶ and we‚Äôre engaged. I just.. I‚Äôm so at a loss. I wish the best for him truly but I feel at my end, even though we get along well as of recently. He talks to me tenderly but I find myself hating him most of the time. It hurts my heart. He told me the other day ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay if you still hate me‚Äù. Except it‚Äôs not. I believe he‚Äôs changed. I just don‚Äôt know if I can do this anymore. ",,,

It's gotten even worse since then, with her flying into a rage every morning about something I did or didn't do. Yesterday it was because I had forgotten to light the mosquito coils by the back door. The day before it was because I had been playing with our son rather than washing the dishes (of which there were about three dirty plates). Shes yelled point blank that I ""disgust"" her and that she ""hates"" me. It's exhausting and distressing, and if it was just me, I'd have left long ago.

But we have a 3yo child who I adore and he adores me. I spend basically every moment outside of work caring and raising him. We even coslept together. But for the past few months my wife has been accusing me of being an unfit and negligent parent. Her reasons, in my opinion, are trivial, like missing a patch of skin while applying sunscreen or packing the wrong coloured hat in his daycare bag, but she considers my errors life-endangering, either because she is neurotic or because she's intentionally trying to position herself as the primary carer if we seperate.

The thought of having to stay in a hostile relationship fills me with dread, but the thought of only seeing my son half the week or less is worse. My worst nightmare is that I move out a my wife cuts off all contact between me and my son. I don't have the money to take her to court, and even if I did, a trial could take months or even years, by which time my son might not even recognise me.

Anyway, I dont expect anyone to have a solution. I just thought I'd share, and maybe give some insight into why some people stay in abusive or unhappy relationships. Thanks.",,,

About 1 yr later ‚Ä¶ and the mask has completely fallen off - I can see the relationship for what it truly is: abuse, point blank. No sugar coating it. I can see that I do not love this person and we are not ‚Äúsoul-mates‚Äù or ‚Äúcosmically intertwined‚Äù, I am in a trauma bond. I‚Äôve lost a lot of myself, become isolated, fearful, and above all just so gd exhausted - but I‚Äôm not done fighting. Even with this clarity, I‚Äôm having trouble formulating an actionable plan to escape- just to a hotel for 1 night or 2 to rest, to breathe for a second. To make the calls I need to and to re-connect with my local DV organizations to help me secure stable housing amongst other resources. Im ready to leave, I‚Äôm packed, but I have reasonable and genuine fear that if I go while my abuser is home something bad may happen, and I‚Äôm experiencing major brain fog & issues with my executive functioning in general. Sometimes I will just lock myself in the bathroom and literally do nothing for an hour or two bc I‚Äôve been in survival mode so long it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm paralyzed sometimes. Im planning on reaching out to a DV advocate through text but im worried even with writing this I‚Äôm being monitored. He‚Äôs not psychologically well and prone to paranoia and psychotic episodes. I‚Äôm in the Midwest in a rural town 1,000 miles away from my entire family and everything I‚Äôve ever known - my parents don‚Äôt understand the full scope of the situation - hell I don‚Äôt even think I fully grasp what the hell is happening to me right now. Currently there is an active no contact order protecting me from him, but when I was evicted I had no where else to go ‚Ä¶ or at least felt that way ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm trespassed from this property, and he‚Äôs been charged with assaulting me (which prompted the no contact) but then we had a situation in which I had to spend a night in jail as well as him for violating my own no contact. So it creates this environment where I‚Äôm scared to call anyone for help or report it because I really don‚Äôt want to go back to jail, it was one of the worst experiences aside from the abuse that I‚Äôve had. My charges got dropped. Also - he got me a cat pretty much as soon as we met, she‚Äôs been through all of it right by me. She‚Äôs sits on my chest and purrs when I have panic attacks, and sometimes the fact that she is excited to see me when I come home from work or wake up in the morning is the only nice and kind thing that happens to me all day. She‚Äôs family, it would literally tear my soul in half to leave her behind. It doesn‚Äôt feel like an option. But I‚Äôm willing to be realistic and make a hard decision if i have to. Deciding to leave is a hard thing, but I can do this. We can get out. I‚Äôve secured a small short term loan from a local credit union and I sell clothes on Depop to generate some more income but my financial situation is dire. No savings, ~$550 in the bank, $40 cash, I have cat food and litter, my ID and cards, my laptop (broken charger I have to get replaced) some toiletries, and anything sentimental that isn‚Äôt too big to carry. I took the next week off after this Friday (03/14/25) when I have a shift at a local coffee shop. I don‚Äôt have a vehicle and im in an Uber desert essentially with one singular taxi that only drives within the city limit or else it‚Äôs sort of expensive. I‚Äôve looked at a couple options on Turo for a truck/car for a day or two but I have limited funds. I‚Äôm struggling to put the pieces together, but staying is only making it worse. So - shot in the dark time. Any advice, tips, tricks, guidance, encouragement‚Ä¶. Anything and everything helps. ",,,

I had to do a larger than normal grocery run, and I am now a single mom so obviously I needed to bring my son. I‚Äôm in a location that the only family around to help watch him is my ex‚Äôs family so that was a no go.

So, due to previous experiences, I HAD TO put my son in the main compartment of the cart. No if, ands, or buts, it had to be that way for my freshly out of trauma, single mom brain to not have the hell raising toddler in the middle of a grocery store screaming that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to sit there‚Äù and ‚Äúlet me go‚Äù for an hour, which garners aggressively judgmental looks. And the 10 trips we‚Äôd taken previously were without incident simply because I let him sit in the bottom part of the cart.

As you can tell, this one was NOT without incident, but I did not know that at the time. 

To my surprise, my son and I completed our entire grocery store shopping experience with joy and random sing-a-long‚Äôs and queued up to an empty cashing lane, to which I was met with, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have your own bags, do you want some but you‚Äôre going to have to pay for them‚Äù to which I met with a ‚ÄúI have my own bags!‚Äù But then looked into the cart and realized all of my items were on top of them so I had to empty the cart (that still contained my happy son) onto the conveyor belt to get to my reusable bags. 

She huffed and puffed, refusing to scan a single item until I had reached the bags, whilst I‚Äôm apologizing profusely, calling myself stupid, and she‚Äôs just huffing and rolling her eyes. 

I have everything finally precariously placed as my son looks on in wonder as I rip the bags out from under the last remnants of the items we had joyously gathered together. 

She finally slacks and asks me to donate $1 to whatever charity, at which at that point I went ‚Äúsure, whatever, that‚Äôs fine‚Äù in hopes she‚Äôd be somewhat less hostile. 

However it continued and she demanded all the items in the bottom of my cart have their barcodes pointed upwards so she didn‚Äôt have to help, so‚Ä¶.without realizing my son was standing up at the end of the cart, I pulled the cart towards me to adjust and then everything went slow motion.

I see my toddler toppling backwards out of the cart, back of the head into the floor. I‚Äôm trapped in the cash out lane between my cart, the person behind me and that damned conveyor belt. My eyes go wide, my son is screaming, I can‚Äôt reach him, but by the grace of god, the teen in the next lane over can reach him and lifts him into the cart so I can reach him. I hold him, he‚Äôs crying, and I realize she‚Äôs 4/5 through my order so I tell her to finish because I won‚Äôt be making this trip again and refuse to restart it the next time as I was checking over my son.

She‚Äôs huffing and puffing all over again, muttering how I should just leave and go to the ER. I already KNEW my night would be spent in the ER, but what SHE didn‚Äôt know is that I had been previously trained and worked as an EMT, so I knew 1) he didn‚Äôt loose consciousness, 2) he wasn‚Äôt vommitting, and 3) he was completely coherent and acting like my simply shocked from getting hurt son. So finish my order, we‚Äôll check out, I‚Äôll frantically drop it at home and grab all the things I need from home to make him comfortable because I know ER visits aren‚Äôt quick and let me go.

So I finish finally, and walk out but a lady from inside chases me down and reminds me to do an incident report in case he‚Äôs more injured than expected. 

I may seem apathetic rn but I was in a horrored shock during all of this. I was beating myself up over finishing the order, over moving the cart that caused him to fall, over being the horrible mom that let him in the lower part of the cart instead of dealing with the screaming for strapping him into the child safe seat. I was horrified. 

But I walked back in with him to do a quick report before the long night ahead. 

To his credit, the manager was so sweet, he was helping me fill it out as my son kept stating how he hurt and had a headache and I sped through the paperwork. But then SHE walked up and went ‚Äúwhy the hell is she filing a report?!‚Äù She turns to me and goes ‚Äúyou know it‚Äôs YOUR fault this happened right?‚Äù
I said ‚Äúyes, that‚Äôs what I was finishing writing in the report, so don‚Äôt talk to me‚Äù
She continued about how I was going to try to sue the grocery store and I was a bad mom‚Ä¶..and to be honest, the thought NEVER crossed my mind to sue because I was simply filing the report so it was there and SHE is the one that made me want to. 
She kept spouting about how I didn‚Äôt care about my son and finally the manager came back with my copy of the report and I left.

 Luckily, after spending almost 7 hrs in the ER, we found out he‚Äôs ok. Which was made easier from the stop at home to get his favorite plushies and tablet and snacks. Obviously if he had been worse off I would have dropped everything and ran out of the store with my son to the hospital. 

But right off rip she was a dick for no reason, then attacked me afterwards. 

My philosophy is that you never know what someone is going through so why treat people like shit right off the bat. You literally have to earn my ire. 
I shouldn‚Äôt have to enter an establishment and go ‚Äúhey, my child and I were abused for years and just got out of it and I have trauma disassociation and memory loss so if I don‚Äôt react appropriately to traumatic situations, forgive me‚Äù.

Ps, talked to her corporate office and stated that I would never want anyone to lose their means of income and maybe just do some training on customer service and empathy.
Because there was no reason for her to run up as I‚Äôm making a report as I‚Äôm basically crying and telling me it‚Äôs all my fault and telling me what a horrible mother I am because my son fell out of a shopping cart.",,,

He doesn‚Äôt do this regularly but when he does he binges for days and does absolutely ridiculous dangerous things. Yesterday he spent the whole day at multiple different bars and it was day 2 of his binge and I didn‚Äôt want me 26f (8 months pregnant) or my child 2f around it so when I got off work I went to our house grabbed our things and went up to my mother in laws house (she lives right in front of our house on the same property) this is something I do when he gets like this to avoid conflict. His mom and I went to where he was and took his vehicle so he could not drive it & we drove it home. His phone was in the vehicle and his mother brought it in the house. This is normal and he usually doesn‚Äôt even notice and just gets his phone once he‚Äôs sober. This time was different though usually he just goes home passes out and the next day when he sobers up we talk he apologizes and we go home and he does work on this behavior. This time though he came up to my mother in laws house and at the time he showed up I was alone with my child in the home. He went around the house banging on all the windows screaming nonsense and kicking things over all over the place. I heard him wanting his phone and I wanted to just give it to him but he was acting so scary and I was alone with my child so I just kept the doors and windows locked and told him to go home and go to bed and went to a safe area with my child until my mil and fil got home. When they got home they started talking with him and he was just arguing saying obsurtities about me and that he wanted his phone so I walked out the door a bit closer to him and threw his phone towards him and told him to go home. His phone hit the ground and shattered and was unusable. He seemed to just see red he was furious I went back inside and my fil came inside and I was scared that he was going to go home and hurt my cat in our house. (I know now I shouldn‚Äôt have gone and this was stupid) He was still on the porch screaming when I decided I had enough time to just go to my house and grab my cat since he was on foot and I was going to be in my car. I left my child with my fil, I drove down to my house ran inside grabbed my cat and as I was getting in my car he slammed the front door causing the cat to get startled and jump out of my arms and run onto our porch trying to get in the door I went to the door grabbed him and next thing I know my husband had pushed me to the porch ground, I had my cat in my arms and was crouched over him in fetal position screaming please stop I‚Äôm leaving please don‚Äôt hurt me he kicked me on my back I peed my pants and before he could do anything else I was able to get my cat and I in the car and back to my in laws. 
He has never physically hurt me before and I do not know how to deal with this situation now. I am being told we are both at fault because I should not have thrown and shattered his phone. I feel as if breaking his phone is not comparable to being physically hurt by him or a reason I should have been hurt by him. I do feel bad about breaking his phone and have said I would take care of replacing it but ive had multiple people now tell me that I warranted the physical behavior and was in the wrong as well.

I told him yes, in January which I showed the cop a video of my ex choking me. He told me an investigator would reach out to me. He sent me a link to submit evidence of my bruises which I did.
2 days later the investigator calls me to meet him at the station, I go and basically he has me explain both January and February incidents from start to finish to him also he sent me the link to where I provided evidence from both days. Picture of my bruises, video of the choking and text threads. That day he also had a girl police take additional pictures of the bruises on my body. I informed the investigator my ex states I hit him but I can‚Äôt recall if I did or did not in the January incident where he choked me in the video.
After meeting with him I emailed him recanting my statement and cooperation with the investigation, that I‚Äôm not pursuing charges nor a protection order.  He called me to verify my ex hadn‚Äôt contacted me to change my mind. I reassured him no we are not in contact and I did not feel threatened in any way. He stated in the email he would note my decision on the report.
From a mutual friend 2 days later I was told my ex met with the investigator but basically he focused on asking him about the physical parts only not the whole story from start to finish like he had me do. He left and was told to submit evidence on the link as well. He stated to our mutual friend that he submitted a picture of a bite mark on his back done from me in the January incident but I truly don‚Äôt recall doing that. I can‚Äôt confirm nor deny. (Note: both incidents I did tell the investigator we had been drinking those days) he says the investigator has not contacted to ask him about the picture of the bite mark on his back because my ex didn‚Äôt remember about the mark until after he had already left from meeting with the investigator. That same week my ex got a lawyer and they just sent the investigator a letter stating they are representing him. The investigator has not reached out to me either. It has been about 3 1/2 weeks already. 
I called the DA victim advocate office in the courthouse they stated they didn‚Äôt have my case # on file and that since no arrest had been made they would reject the case that it‚Äôs up to the police department to make the arrest and that is how they get involved. I told her the investigator told me he will submit the case to the prosecutor and they would decide if the case gets picked up or not. That he said it‚Äôs not up to the PD but the state so I‚Äôm now confused in all this ",,,

I was in an abusive marriage and my ex husband would grab my arms and leave bruises when he would get angry and yell at me. I have a feeling this is now happening to my oldest son. My nine year old came home with bruises on the back of his arm again. A couple of months ago, he one in the front of his arm and it looked like a thumb print to me. My son said he couldn‚Äôt remember and then switched and said it was from running into something at school. This week he has more bruises but on the back of his upper arm, at first he said it was from dad grabbing him and then switched to falling down the stairs. I only have two photos and a video of these bruises. Is this enough to fight for custody or a restraining order if my son says he cannot remember/changes the story?

1j9bnzf,Fleeing domestic violence in Los Angeles,DivineLove777777,1,2025-03-12 05:02:07+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j9bnzf/fleeing_domestic_violence_in_los_angeles/,"I‚Äôm in a really tough situation and need advice. My shelter is closing on June 30 because LAHSA pulled their grant due to fraud. Instead of rehousing us, they‚Äôre just telling us to ‚Äúget income‚Äù to qualify for a PATH subsidy. Originally, we were told the subsidy would cover the deposit and part of the rent for the first year, tapering off gradually. Now, they‚Äôre only covering the deposit.

I was laid off while at the shelter and went on General Relief (GR) as advised by my case manager. But now she‚Äôs giving me the runaround, and since my GR is ending soon, I no longer qualify for housing assistance through it.

I‚Äôve been in the shelter for almost a year, and I‚Äôm beyond my breaking point‚Äîmentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I don‚Äôt feel safe here. I even had to issue a cease-and-desist to the main site coordinator for verbally assaulting and harassing me. I‚Äôve never been homeless before; I‚Äôm here because I‚Äôm fleeing domestic violence.

Recently, I got an offer for a fully remote state job‚Äîmy dream job. I‚Äôve been applying for months, and this is the only offer I‚Äôve received. But I have nowhere to set up an office, store paperwork, or hang professional clothes for video calls. The department hasn‚Äôt confirmed whether I need a hardline internet connection either. My car is literally my only space.

Now, my case manager suddenly tells me LAHSA has a housing program for people with mental health diagnoses. I got documentation from my therapist confirming PTSD and depression, plus verification of my physical disability. She says this should make me eligible, but she doesn‚Äôt know when LAHSA will get back to me. I‚Äôve been here for a year‚Äîwhy is she just now telling me about this when she‚Äôs known I‚Äôm fleeing domestic violence?

PATH is income-based, so I don‚Äôt qualify until I start working. I filed a grievance with LAHSA about the shelter closing with no rehousing plan, and they were shocked. They said it‚Äôs against their policy to exit people without a plan. The person I spoke to said she‚Äôd look into it, but I haven‚Äôt heard anything since. Apparently, the shelter was supposed to find a new grant, not shut down entirely.

When I tried to push for answers, the site coordinator basically mocked me and told me I should be ‚Äúlooking for housing.‚Äù How am I supposed to do that when they withhold info about internal programs? I also went to the Department of Mental Health for help, and they told me they don‚Äôt do housing‚Äîyet people from my shelter have gotten apartments through them, with rent covered and Section 8 vouchers, even though they weren‚Äôt fleeing DV or disabled.

I‚Äôm supposed to be on the emergency housing list for DV survivors and disabled individuals, but I have no confirmation that‚Äôs actually happening. I also reached out to D.A.R.T. about DV housing, and they were supposed to follow up with me today, but I haven‚Äôt heard back.

I feel like I‚Äôve exhausted every possible option. Does anyone have viable suggestions? I have to take this state job, but I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to succeed without stable housing.",,,

We have technically stayed together during this time but ultimately over the last 2 weeks I felt very confident in my choice to break up with him, I had hard days with normal feelings of heartbreak but I knew I would be ending the relationship. I wasn‚Äôt sure when or how but I knew I was ready and I was slowly detaching from him and us. 

This past weekend we went to a wedding out of town for his brother (none of his family knows about the abuse or any of our business) and it was an amazing weekend and now, since the incident that happened in the beginning of February- I feel attracted and truly attached and in love with him again. He has been dedicated to me and making things work after everything that happened and I never reciprocated those feelings until now. I know we can‚Äôt be together and it can never work out realistically, especially because of the fact my friends and family know about the abuse and I know I can truly find a healthy love one day. But I can‚Äôt help but feel back in a headspace/ trauma bond that I thought I had grown from. 

Is this a normal thing to happen in abusive relationships? Is there a possibility I can get back to the mindset I was in before this weekend? 

I‚Äôm turning 25 in a few months and don‚Äôt want to waste more time with someone I know I can never be with but I‚Äôm still so in love and attached to him as I thought he was going to be the man I married. ",,,
1j96yzs,I've put up with this shit for 12 years.,Existing_Phase1644,1,2025-03-12 01:01:33+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j96yzs/ive_put_up_with_this_shit_for_12_years/,"For context, I live with my folks. My step-dad is hard of hearing, and my mother is an A type personality with a history of domestic abuse that was trained into her as a kid. I, myself, don't drive, have a difficult time finding work of any kind, and at 40, post attempt, with PTSD, just livethrough this continued hell.   
Day after fucking day.  
We walk around on egg shells because who knows what the fuck is goingto set her off. She lashes out whenever she feels like it, saying it's back talk whenever I have a conversation with her, or whenever she hears something she doesn't like.   
She pushes him around a lot, insults, degrades, punches, slaps him, justifies it by saying his mother did the same to me once, or if her mother or father were at the house, we'd be getting our asses whooped, but since they aren't, she will.   
She's only hit me a few times, mainly because I put a stop to it for a while, and the last time i simply let her, because it was kind of justified. Ate more than I was supposed to.   
I've basically stopped talking in general, stopped trying to figure out a way to get my life on track, battling with light to medium depression, and just focus on what's in front of me. She tends to start arguments for no reason other than to try and start an argument, threatens homelessness and yeah, my resume isn't the greatest.   
I hate living here, but I don't have anywhere to go.   
Since I've failed to get into the military she's been verbally and emotionally abusive,  manipulative, and randomly starts screaming throughout the house.   
I get it. 

I'm 40, should have my life on track at this point. But that's still no excuse to hit me or her husband and then get offended when we call her out on it. I've gotten numb to it, no point in letting what she does to me both directly or indirectly affect me anymore then it already has.

There was a moment, just weeks after I had gotten ack, after I had broken up with my girlfriend at the time, where I really needed someone to talk to, it was a mental spiral that really fucked with my head. I tried approaching her, but she said she didn't have time for me. The next few moments after she left were a blur, thankfully, the attempt didn't take. 

now a days? I just try to get through the day as blank minded as possible. I don't date, I don't invite people over, I don't go to the campus. I just sit around waiting for a heart attack to take me so I don't have to live through this fucking hell anymore.   
I'm alive for some reason, still. But I don't think god or whoever made the right choice in letting me live. At least, that's how i felt back then. Now a days, I just.... try not to think at all. ",,,

1j90z9v,healthy mechanisms to stay away from my abusive ex,No-Vegetable-8450,3,2025-03-11 20:38:31+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j90z9v/healthy_mechanisms_to_stay_away_from_my_abusive_ex/,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm hoping someone could give me a bit of advice. I feel very stuck. I have been in a abusive relationship for about five years now. 


The last year has been the best year I have made a lot of steps forward. Cutting contact a lot of the time for maybe a month, two months at a time but I always end up going back, the cycle usually starts as okay will be friends and then the friendship starts to become possessive, he‚Äôll usually will turn into the person that is abusive, mentally questioning me about everything who I‚Äôm with what I‚Äôm doing, isolating me from having a life outside him things like that. 

The issue that seems to keep me stuck is that I seem to want to still be civilised with him or on talking terms? Or that I feel like I don‚Äôt want him to see me in this bad light? 

I feel like verbally he has always been so hard with accusations on cheating and other guys that I feel the need to be this ‚Äògood girl‚Äô and prove that I‚Äôm not out or with anyone else- this will include us staying in contact and just being friends but him feeling the need to know inner details about my personal life. 

For example, we aren‚Äôt speaking momentarily because I went to see a physio and he flipped the lid because it was a man. 

I can‚Äôt live like that, I won‚Äôt live like that. 
But I really struggle with not reaching out to nearly fix his perception or getting him to understand why I‚Äôm innocent. 

I really hope this resonates with someone, I‚Äôve been in therapy, doing amazing work on myself and know I will come out the other side of this and finally cut the cord. 

I think with this post I‚Äôm really looking for coping mechanisms in the mean time, things to not make me feel awful and keep me from contacting him to ensure that he knows I‚Äôm a ‚Äògood girl‚Äô as such. 


I‚Äôve came such a long way from reactive abuse and the girl I used to be would be so proud, I just feel so stuck on these end parts and trying to fix these bad habits. I‚Äôm nearly 1000% sure he knows what he‚Äôs doing by this silent treatment and accusations because he knows it‚Äôs the only way to reach me.

Thanks for letting me post this and vent. And I really appreciate anything that might give me some help with this. ",,,

He messed with her car where she is staying at her friend‚Äôs house, so it‚Äôs still a problem. 

Should I bother to keep trying to get authorities to respond? Or just get her a new apartment and leave it alone?

Well Anyways skip forward a few months from that conversation and were out drinking and I'm already alittle over tipsy and that conversation comes up again. This time being alittle drunk I told them that I didn't know if I would or wouldn't have a 3 sum with them. We'll they continued to buy me drinks throughout the night until I was so drunk I couldn't walk and had to use there arms to help me up. We'll we get back to there place and ended up hooking up. The next morning I left and just went home. We never really talked about it again and technically I said yes but I was also really drunk. Now I just can't get it out of my mind we have hung out multiple times since then and nothing has happened. But was I taken advantage of? Is this considered rape since you can't constant while drunk? I would have never done it sober and feel ashamed about what happened and that i continue to hangout with them. But shes my best friend since we were little and i dont have anyone else I talk to.

We have been together since the 21 April 2024 and I've been the only one who worked to this day.

Even if i have quit my job on July i still managed to sell item (my loved Pokemon card collection or Hunter x Hunter collection, vr headset, Nintendo switch and a lot of stuff) to buy food and other stuff like theater or date together.

But recently i have nothing much to sell and couldn't get a job (live in France) so we just eat bread with nothing else.

And he have helped us with max 50‚Ç¨ worth of groceries since April 2024.

He we're kicked out of is house because tbh we are ""not like usual couple"" cuz we are 2 men that love each other i guess, so this isn't a simple situation (is mother is horrible she never said hello or thx you to me).

But after that safe place that my parents and i offered to im, and all i have done he keep saying me to get a job and 1 hour ago he just told me in front of my mother that this is MY PARENTS that's feeding him and not me, like i never done it before, at cost of what i have worked for to afford and cherish (god i miss my collections), he even add that he loss 3killograme in a week (cuz we don't eat so much) but said it like it's my fault.

I know i'm not perfect, like no one is.
But I've always do my best and i don't know what to do and worst of it, I'm starting to think i don't do enough even if i got nothing to give anymore.

I just feel that I'm been used, what I can't bring my self to believe.

He is also very unpleasant with me for no reason sometimes and insulting me freely (i do it too, but not that much and mostly just to respond to is aggressiveness)

He used a lot of ""then i broke up with you"" emotional blackmail.

And everytime we argue it goes really far and 2 time i told him to leave he just hit me and slap me.

I could add more details but i feel like i said to much and i just need answers to this question.

I'm i doing enough ?

Does abuse of me financially ?

What should i do or what i could do or he could do to get this better ?

The relationship and relationship advice told me le to post this here so i do

Im afraid the next time i will told I'm he do the same btw.",,,

1j8vz4x,I need guidance on helping someone experiencing DV,doofydink,1,2025-03-11 17:14:09+00:00,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j8vz4x/i_need_guidance_on_helping_someone_experiencing_dv/,"So I (21m) am a student living in a smallish college town, and have known this girl (22f) for about two years now. Over these two years, she‚Äôs become one of my closest friends, and at this point we‚Äôve both admitted that it‚Äôs become more than that really. For context, I work a part-time job and she is also one of my coworkers. One day she showed up to work with CLEAR signs of a physical altercation happening between her and her bf (bruising under the eye), and since that day I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about it. This was about 8 months ago. Around the same time, my roommate was moving out so I was gonna have an open room in my apartment. I ended up telling her that if she ever needs a place to go for a night or to even move into that she is absolutely welcome, and she pretty much said yes on the spot, but warned me that it would take a long time for her to be ready. 

Since then, she‚Äôs told me more about her situation. She ran away from home and moved in with this guy when she was 16, and mind you, this vile dude was my age when he had her do that so not only is he an abuser, he‚Äôs a groomer. He constantly insults her, tells her she‚Äôs useless and that he hates her and doesn‚Äôt even want her around, so the abuse goes beyond physical as well. From what she‚Äôs told me, there is nothing left but a trauma bond in their relationship, and she tells me everyday how she can‚Äôt wait for it to be over. 

Currently, she still wants to move in with me whenever she can, and I‚Äôve made sure she‚Äôs still comfortable with that plan. I try not to push her to do it too hard because I know just dropping everything in your life and leaving on a dime is no small choice, and as well as that I know she‚Äôs trying to avoid doing the same thing that got her into that situation in the first place. I guess what I need guidance on is, what can I do besides just wait? Should I get the police involved if I ever see a physical sign like that again? Should I be encouraging her more? Will I be putting myself, or worse her in danger by inserting myself into her life like that? I‚Äôm 21 and never been in a situation like this so I may be in over my head trying to help, but I see so much of myself in this person that it hurts me more to watch and not do anything about it.",,,
1j8uxcc,Reporting my ex partner for sexual abuse,AggressivePassion835,1,2025-03-11 16:31:18+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j8uxcc/reporting_my_ex_partner_for_sexual_abuse/,"*TW: sexual assault, grooming*

I (24F) know that I should contacted the police regarding this situation, but it‚Äôs more complicated since it mostly involves coercion and sexual abuse so I‚Äôm unsure if what he (34M) has done is basically a crime. I don‚Äôt really have much proof in my end either since I have him blocked off everything, and I later consented only to please him. I‚Äôve also had another former partner of this person speak to me regarding an incident where he was choking her out, and she thought about contacting police but never took action; I‚Äôm not really sure if I want to speak directly to police agencies since I later gave in to what he did towards me even though I never verbally consented what he did to me (long story short, he‚Äôs into hard BDSM, rape fantasy scenarios, and humiliation kinks in which the second time we had sex he just put this onto me without warning).

This situation is also extremely complicated and fucked since I‚Äôve known this person ‚ÄúFoley‚Äù since I was 17 (2017) We met at this retail store I worked at, and he was 27 at the time; we didn‚Äôt start becoming friends at least until I was 18 by the time I was in college. By the time I left college at 22 (2022), we started hanging out and during that time we began seeing each other again for 6 months. But we was still inflicting these weird kinks, and I only stayed because I loved him and wanted him to stay. I broke things off with him because I found out that he was in a 2 years relationship with someone else (‚ÄúI‚Äù) in which she told me more about his behavior including when he choked her out.

Recently around last August, Foley reached out to ‚Äúmake amends‚Äù but only for us to resume seeing each other romantically. But it was only for 4 months, and honestly things became worse; the last time we saw each other, I had a traumatic sexual experience with him which led to me finally cutting things off and blocking him for good.

I‚Äôm now realizing the fact that his behavior was abusive and the grieving process has been tough. Some days I‚Äôm okay, but then I find myself crying and feeling helpless because I don‚Äôt know what to do or what action to take against him. I go to therapy to talk about everything, in which my therapist suggested that I should possibly speak to authorities about this. But with what proof? I literally have nothing to show, and I feel like a lot of things would be used against me since I reconciled with him the 2nd time and later consented to everything afterwards. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a grooming type situation, but he would often comment during sex that he‚Äôs wanted me since I was 17 and it‚Äôs just fucking weird and disturbing. He would say how much I was ‚Äúin love‚Äù with him at this time, but it was only a crush. We barely knew each other or were even close the first year we worked together.

I feel awful because he‚Äôs also in a situation in which he‚Äôs possibly at risk of getting deported, and part of me wants to submit a tip no matter how fucked up it sounds (if anything, that‚Äôs the last thing I‚Äôd want to do). Overall, I feel extremely helpless and I don‚Äôt want to face rejection from authorities from the fact that I don‚Äôt have much to show  on my end.

*update: I contacted my local police district and they suggested for me to come in to speak to an officer. As for them pressing charges and something actually being done, it depends on whether a detective would be able to accept my case*",,,

Just feeling alone and hoping to hear from someone out there. I've been with my husband since 2020. He's always been controlling/possessive, we started as a long distance relationship and I thought things would ease up when he knew that I was fully invested in him. As time has passed, the verbal abuse is still there, but physical abuse grew as well. I'm in another country with him alone, and I'm just sad. I feel like he took everything from me. I don't really have friends anymore or anyone to talk to. Right now I'm at a hotel, I'm staying here until I get paid and can afford a ticket to go home, not for another week. He always blames everything on me and says that I take no responsibility for anything. We had a perfect month, and once my period starts everything blows up. It's hard for me to take the verbal abuse when I feel emotional. I feel guilty for fighting back. I feel guilty that he says I ruined everything and wasted so many years. I feel heartbroken because I love him anyways. I can't stop crying, and I always question myself. What if I just found a better way to swallow it all? Maybe it would all stop. We had so many dreams for the future. We were going to move to my country. I still question how much better life would be if we did. Where I could be the one to have more of a lead. Maybe then he would see the real me more and not think I'm stupid, and lazy, and pathetic, and a piece of shit. It's hard for me to do things here, I don't speak the language, and he always says I'm just lazy and don't push him to go out and do stuff together. I know I don't deserve it, but I know I'm not innocent either. I want kids, I want a family, I feel like I'm wasting my life trying to get things to be better when I know they won't. I feel hopeless and crushed. I just don't see anything positive right now and really need some help. I love him through it all, but I know I'm just stupid.

I tried to build a life in my abuse and I tried to be content with what was happening. I've seen so much but it's time for the new chapter to begin.


How do I cope with leaving my life and items behind to escape? Shelters don't allow me to bring my items with me, only the bare miniumin.


I know people say your life is more important than items but I have to get rid of things that matter to me that I won't be able to get back. I know freedom will be worth it but it really hurts right now.

Saying goodbye to my bed, my favorite desk, my books, my blankets, everything.

It honestly scared me so bad I looked at her and I asked what the fuck was wrong with her and why the fuck did she just do that? I kept saying you did not just do that and she looked at me and said all I do is fuck everything up and she walked away to go talk to one of her friends When I tell you to look in her eyes was not my girlfriend. It was some evil entity it was full of pure hatred and it scared the shit out of me.

Minnesota lawmakers propose introducing a bold new bill, the Freedom Against Interpersonal Reproductive Entrapment (FAIRE) Act, which aims to address coerced parenthood as a form of domestic abuse. The law would allow individuals who feel trapped in a forced pregnancy, surrogacy, or adoption to seek ex parte protective orders‚Äîsimilar to restraining orders in domestic violence cases‚Äîto block or stop the process.

Supporters argue that forced parenthood can be just as psychologically damaging as physical abuse, leading to depression, suicide, and mental health crises. The bill would offer immediate legal relief, allowing courts to issue orders preventing one partner from coercing another into becoming a parent against their will.

Critics, however, worry about due process concerns, potential misuse, and even claims that the law could lead to state-mandated abortions in extreme cases. The bill's broad language raises questions about how these orders would be enforced, including whether law enforcement could intervene in an ongoing pregnancy.

Does this law go too far, or is it a necessary step in protecting people from reproductive coercion? Should forced parenthood be treated as a form of domestic abuse?

We have some slight issues, he still has no career goals/no drive, the jealousy issues have been a work in progress but have gotten significantly better. I could go into more detail regarding those issues but the most recent event is what I need advice on. When my BF drinks he has always become more jealous, incoherent, not recognizable etc. When drinking together it typically ends with him getting mad, me crying or me crying because I think he is upset, obviously I realize this is my anxiety from the past times we've drank. Typically, the morning after these events I start to gaslight myself about why I was so upset as the alcohol hurts the memory, although I remember the feelings being real last night I typically question the details which makes me less confident of my emotions so we both apologize have conversation and feel better. 

Last halloween (2024) my sister (F23) my BF and I went out, my sister and I were at a table talking to some guys, my BF saw this and I waved him over, he has this face like I had murdered his mother. I instantly try to shut this down cause I can't handle it, long story short he was insanely hammered (not an excuse) and pushed me hard into a hightop, tried to come after me again and my sister got in between him and I. I had my hands in my hair stressed and he commented I hope you rip it out. He had never been physical while drunk with me before at this point, the next morning he can't remember so I tell him. He starts to cry, apologize etc, we discuss recognizing limits. I tell him if it happens again I will leave him but all in all I end up comforting him then forgiving and forgetting. 

3 days ago it happened again, I asked him to sober up while I was outside waiting with my friend till their ride came, I come back and he obviously worse. Later, I explain I was just sad and wished he had sobered up when I asked. He kept claiming he had nothing wrong, once I was ready for bed I told him I was headed up and he ignored me then called his friends inviting them over. As I am grabbing the rest of my things to head to the bedroom, he tells me he is tired of this. With that I finally loose control over my emotions, i start to cry and tell him he is being very mean and I head upstairs and lock the door behind me. 3 minutes later he is knocking, his sister is sleeping in the room over and I was nervous he was going to wake her up so I crack it and very calmly tell him i'm going to sleep alone tonight, or I can even more to the other bedroom and he can have this one, that I just need space. He begins to tell me I should be the one alone, I am a waste of his time and tells me he wont talk to me when I go on my trip, I explain that isn't what I said and I just need some space, he then switches me and asks me to leave him alone during my trip and leaves. 2 minutes later he is back but more aggressively shaking the knob then banging, i crack the door at this point he aggressively bodies the door open hitting me and asking me ""whos in here?"" I am starting to cry again and keep repeating ""please leave, please just leave"" I try pushing to just get him out of the doorway, he won't move and is silent. Now I am scared and shakily still begging him to leave, as an attempt to scare him I say ""I am going to call my parents"", he starts smiling and laughing in my face and eventually does leave the room after I stop talking, he calls me a bitch as I shut and lock the door. I had to call my dad to come get me, while he went back out, lost his phone and was even walked home by the cops. Before he lost the phone he was sending miss spelled texts, that he can't figure me out and I am a mistake. 

He doesn't remember this the next morning, says he is sorry if he disrespected me and that he thought we had a goodnight. After explaining what happened, he tells me he is sorry, how he is disgusted with himself etc. I leave for a 2 week europe trip today with my sister, I told him we could talk more when I get back. I know I should end it, I know these are signs, I am just terrified of the hurt, I genuinely love him, we have a great relationship aside from the drinking, he is my best friend, so kind and loving when sober.

1j8m9ju,How am i supposed to feel?,imsomewhereinnarnia,1,2025-03-11 08:45:43+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j8m9ju/how_am_i_supposed_to_feel/,"I‚Äôve always felt that my boyfriend had very violent and aggressive tendencies with me. Simply throwing me around (in an unsexual manner.), pushing/shoving me, throwing things as soft as a pillow, but with all of his force to where the impact itself hurt, hitting things around me, etc. There was a time i simply told him i wasn‚Äôt going to do something, he then pushed me as hard as he could on the asphalt we were walking on.  Before you assume, OF COURSE I SEE THE SIGNS. I trusted him though. I have slapped him in the face before i admit, but after that time i had matured, he hadn‚Äôt. We got into an argument one night where he was being very violent and aggressive with me, no he had never hit me at this point. He was doing the usual shit, grabbing me by the face, throat (not to where i couldn‚Äôt breathe), jaw and head, he even went to the point of sticking his finger so hard into my cheek i have sores from my brackets. When i would cry, he would do it more and tell me to ‚Äúshut the fuck up‚Äù. After he continuously grabbed me throwing me around because i was crying, to where i hit the bottom of my head/upper neck area on a hard piece of this futon we were sitting on. While i cried over that he mocked me, telling me to shut up more. He then said something that really upset me to where i did go to slap him, i mean he was just hurting me so badly?? I halfway miss to where my fingers only hit his jaw, he then slaps me across the face. Not that hard to where my head turned. I attempted again, finally got it but i am 5‚Äô3 110. He is 5‚Äô8 160. He‚Äôs a big guy compared to me. He then hit me back so fucking hard my head turned and i could hear it echo through the house. Maybe i was wrong to hit him, maybe not. He isn‚Äôt a bad guy. I just need to know if i should be worried that he will physically abuse me without me doing anything in the beginning, maybe even risking my life.

I‚Äôm in my early 30s now and though I‚Äôm content most of the time in my solitude I want to find someone to share life with. 

I downloaded some dating apps and as I‚Äôm scrolling I‚Äôm seeing some really great guys, ones I have a lot in common with- but I can‚Äôt help feeling that every single one of them is out of my league. They‚Äôre more attractive, funnier, have friends, have a nicer smile, etc.

Buts it also deeper than that- I start to feel unloveable and unworthy, like I actually am the POS my ex told me I was. I‚Äôm just not good enough for anyone.

Has anyone else gone through this? What helped you?",2025-03-11 00:50:21,2025-03-17 02:05:32,all_new_posts
1j8ee2h,My boyfriend trapped me in our home.,Old-Cup-6065,7,2025-03-11 00:43:51+00:00,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j8ee2h/my_boyfriend_trapped_me_in_our_home/,"My boyfriend (M/27) and I (F/27) have been together over a year. I will say the good times are really good however once we moved in together I've been discovering new things about him every day that I don't like. 

We moved in together 6 months after dating. I justified it because I needed a roommate to cut costs or I needed to move back to my parents due to a career switch. We also were co workers prior so we have an existing friendship so it wasn't like I didn't know him.

After the big move I just felt something was off so I went through his phone and found out he had been emotionally cheating on me with a girl Ive already specifically told him I did not like. After that, on routine almost every two months something big happens and I want to leave but he ropes me back in. The other big one I will mention was that he has a porn addiction. 

It's now been three months since the porn addiction discovery. I broke up with him on the spot he begged and begged to stay together. He stayed with his parents for about two weeks then he moved back in. Everything has been fine since until last night and I do not know what to do. 

For context I work two jobs. I have a day job in sales and I bartend at night on the weekends. Saturday night is like my night. I have Sunday off so I work my day job go close the bar and then I go out for about an hour with my best friend and other co workers. I don't have a lot of free time so it's my night to let loose... Responsibly. Yes I drink but I respect my limits. I really just want to have good conversation hear live music and play some pool.

My boyfriend has started voicing that he doesn't like this. I've put my foot down because it's one of the only nights I get to see my bestie and it's been our tradition since we were 21. Our schedules are conflicting now so this is one of the few times we actually get to catch up.

He has now started trying to invite himself. If her boyfriends coming along I'll gladly invite him but if not... I don't. He then started coming into the bar an hour prior to close sitting there getting wasted. I've asked my co workers to cut him off. They don't. He then follows us around and almost tries to physically stand between me and whoever I am trying to talk to. 

On this night in particular his brother and sister in law who is pregnant were in the area. I love them to pieces so I of course told them to come to the bar and invited them to hang out with me and my friend. At this point my boyfriend has already walked in and started his drinking. He got a ride from a friend and they left so apparently he was ""stranded"" once everything is cleaned I tell them I'm going to go wash my hands when I come back my boyfriend is almost forcng his ear on his sister in laws belly to the extent his brother stepped and said ""whoa whoa you usually got to ask first"" 

My boyfriend immediately turned to me and said ""I'm sorry if I've made you uncomfortable babe"" he then started informing them of my miscarriages (that were not with him) and my infertility issues. When we were walking out it was just us. He asked again if that bothered me. 

I replied yes... And went into detail as to why. He started yelling at me telling me that I'm not happy for this baby to be In our lives. He would not stop. 

I told him ""let's not talk about heavy topics while we are intoxicated"" let's make a note and revisit it in the morning. He then went on to tell me I don't love him and that I'm selfish. I almost bailed on everyone but instead I stood my ground and figured I have existing plans and he doesn't get to mess it up. 

The night went on and basically when we were around people he was the sweetest most perfect angel when it was just us he was verbally attacking me. My friend picked up on it and asked me to walk to a different bar down the street just her and I. Do a shot (it was industry night) and come back. 

I go up to my boyfriend and I tell him ""we are going to go to ""bar"" do a shot and come back. Are you okay with that?"" He said yes and gave me a big ol kiss. 

She keeps trying to open up the conversation that something is wrong. She told me If I needed a place to stay to tell him we are having a sleepover at her house. As this is going on he is blowing up my phone. He walks into the bar we are at pissed as can be. Not responding to my friend speaking to him ECT. We go to walk with her to her apartment which is downtown and as we are hugging goodbye he high tails it to my car. We get in and he yells at me the whole way home.

Hes saying things like ""fuck you!"" ""You left me and you left my brother! How disrespectful of you!"" ""I'm going to call your parents to tell them about your behavior"" ""you will be the laughing stock of my family"" he then breaks up with me and asks me to take him to his families. When we get there his yelling gets more intense telling me I don't love him. So I go to our house. I was nonverbal this whole time and he was so mad that I wasn't speaking. Begging me and almost forcing me to look him in my eyes. I tried to pull over he got more abrasive.

When we arrived I asked him to please leave me in the car while I cool off. He got more in my face so I got out of my car and thought I could walk around the block maybe give him time to chill out and me time to decompress. Before I know it he is running down the street yelling and cussing at me. Saying ""I'm going to fucking catch you. You think you can run from me! I can run faster"" so I turned around to walk home. My outdoor cat was with me walking (he always walks with me) he then started saying I was being so crazy I scared out cat. 

Still not saying anything I walked inside and locked myself in our bathroom and started hyperventilating. He was outside yelling still. He then stuck something in the key hole to unlock it and started shining a flashlight in my face. He kept trying to put his hands on me as ""comfort"" but I kept asking him to not touch me I basically had myself wedged in the corner I tried to push him away. After that he stands in front of the sink like he is about to puke. I say ""babe let's go to the toilet"" he won't respond and projectile vomits all in our sink. 

After this he starts yelling at me ""your going to leave and not help me when I'm sick!"" ""And your going to push me!"" I was fed up at this point so my response was ""I'm not cleaning that up you are"" I walked away and I go to the upstairs bathroom to take my makeup off and get ready for bed. Before I know he barges in with a towel covered in vomit and throws it in my face. I looked him dead in the eyes and said

""If your going to throw things at me get out of my house""

He goes ""oh it's just a towel"" and starts reminding me of all of my flaws. 

At this point his sister in law texted letting me know they were home and that she had a lot of. I questioned texting her but didn't. 

Our argument got heavier as I was trying to kick him out. I then decided I was leaving. I grabed a bag and headed to the door. I texted my friend a brief synopsis and wondering if I could stay with her and her boyfriend for the night. As I head for the door my boyfriend pushes me. He blocked the door. Everytime I move towards the door I'm getting pushed I'm getting pulled. At one point it was almost open and I thought I could duck under his arm and squeeze through the passage and he slams it shut on my fingers. I imediatly go for the back door. As I get to the kitchen he is there again pulling me and pushing me. I sat down in defeat. He then sat next to me and cried and cried about all this traumatic shit I've never heard about his life. 

As I was sitting I texted his sister in law what happened. I was hoping his brother would come get him. Instead I was told ""yeah he gets like that when he's too drunk. Usually his mom just has to babysit him and wait till he calms down. I think you just need to try to deescalate the situation."" She then went on to tell me ""I don't think ""boyfriend"" is dangerous. Some people just a cross a line when they are fucked up"" 

We went to sleep after and then I told him he needed to leave and I was breaking up with him. Keep in mind I woke up with bruises which really made it sink it. Anyways He refused to get up. Refused to leave. Was so apologetic. He doesn't even remember what happened. Said he won't drink again. Said he won't hurt me again. While I was trying to leave the night prior he did threaten the fact that he is on this lease so I can't make him leave. 

I feel stuck. I feel drained. And I'm scared it's going to happen again but next time it will be worse. I don't want to live my life tip toeing but he's right I can't kick him out. Not without a police report at least. I grew up watching my mother be abused and I always swore to myself I would never be her. But here I am. I am my mother. 

I keep telling myself when our lease it up I will either move or I will resign without him and have him removed. But I also know the more time I spend with him I always automatically make every wrong doing he has done to me... Forgivable. I treasure our good moments. I am at a loss. Im ashamed of myself and I'm so scared of what's next in our relationship but I am also so scared to be without him. I'm scared to say ""we broke up"" I'm scared to tell my family who loves him what happened. I am scared to not have him with me when I need him. I am scared to say goodbye to this life I thought we built.

She sent me pictures and the way i cried for her all night breaks my heart, especially because I was her a few years ago. 

This man has beaten her black and blue, knocked her out, given her black eyes, dragged her on the street in public and who knows what else that she hasn‚Äôt told me. She currently lives with him and his entire family (who she says had no idea this was going on as she would wear make up and hide it from them) hours away from me and her sister and the rest of her family lives states away. 

To make matters worse, she was pregnant and it seems like she wanted to keep it but then decided to get an abortion ( I‚Äôm guessing something happened between them that made her want to make that decision) but because of the state we were in, she had to fly to another state to get it done. He couldn‚Äôt even bother going with her and she had to go thru the process all alone. This also wasn‚Äôt the first abortion she‚Äôs gotten since being with him. 

She admitted to me while crying she knows he‚Äôs going to kill her one day. I always had my suspicions he was abusive but I didn‚Äôt know any of this was happening, she hid it so well. I had gotten her a train to come back the following day and she was so ready to get out. She was going to live with her sister and try to get her life together. Because of him, she has lost so many good jobs, lost her car, doesn‚Äôt have any money saved up and basically has to start from 0. I was anxious for her to actually get on the train because she has left him and went back to him so many times and i was hoping that since now she was admitting all the horrible things he‚Äôs done, maybe she was ready to leave. But then the next morning when she was getting ready to leave, she admitted that he asked her to stay for at least one more day and cancelled the ticket. She tried to play it off that it was because she couldn‚Äôt fit all her things on a train and would figure out another way to get all her stuff packed and get here. 

This is where I‚Äôm torn. My husband is telling me to tell her sister but her sister is younger and instead of being nurturing, she responds with anger. I know when i was in that situation, i wouldn‚Äôt want to talk to someone who was angry with me. I also feel like her sister will tell their parents and I‚Äôm not sure what will happen then. I know they can‚Äôt force her to leave him but what if they do and then she ruins connections with them? She also said she could never tell her mom because her mom worries enough as it is and i know her sister will tell their mom. But im a mom now too and would want to know if my daughter was going thru this. I also know i will never forgive myself if something happens to her and i never said anything. 

She‚Äôs suppose to come to our town for her sisters birthday next weekend and their mom will be here then so im wondering if i should tell her sister beforehand so maybe they can try to talk to her once they‚Äôre all together ?? 

She already feels like she has no one and i dont want to make things harder for her but at the same time if it means i might be able to save her life, it‚Äôs worth it. ",2025-03-10 18:27:24,2025-03-17 02:05:40,all_new_posts

In 2003, my sister tried to get the case reopened, but she was ignored. Last year, I started pushing again, and Indiana State Police have finally reopened the case. But no family should have to fight this long just to be heard.

I‚Äôm now advocating for legislative reforms to prevent other families from going through this. If you believe in holding law enforcement accountable for misclassified deaths and ensuring real investigations into suspicious suicides, I‚Äôd love your support.

1j82but,Potential Abuse from Autistic Partner,PaintingWooden7399,4,2025-03-10 16:13:09+00:00,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j82but/potential_abuse_from_autistic_partner/,"I am writing this partly to vent and partly for advice because I'm really not sure what to do in this situation.

My partner (M 29) and I (F 27) have been together for over 6 years and have lived together for the past 5 years. My partner is diagnosed with Asperger's/Autism, which I didn't really know much about before being in the relationship with him. Recently I have been unsure if some of his behaviour during his Autistic meltdowns can be considered abuse or if they're just symptoms of his disability.

Some of these issues include-

\- he regularly puts his mental health issues above mine i.e. if I ask him to rephrase something to help me better understand it, he can't do that because that's forcing him to mask and he shouldn't have to mask in his home

\- if he can't finish a task that he's set for himself, he gets more and more agitated as time goes on where he hits road blocks and can't sort the task. The agitation often escalates to him throwing objects across the room, breaking things that are causing him distress, shouting, etc. I feel like I have to step in to help keep him calm or else I might get in the cross hairs of this anger and violence

\- when he has an autistic meltdown he's often unaware of his surroundings and convulses, but wants me to be physically close to him in these moments. Often in the midst of this he can climb on top of me, physically restraining me or over powering me, occasionally hitting me, kicking me or biting me. He also often blames me for causing the meltdowns because I accidentally interrupted him during a task, didn't do something he asked me to do 'because his brain needed it', asked him the wrong question, etc.

\- he often tells me he wants to express his love to me by pulling my hair or biting me but he tries to repress it. When he does randomly yank my hair, and I get upset at him for it he won't accept responsibility for doing it 

He says that he does all of these things because of his autism and that's just how autistic people/brains express themselves, but I am very uncomfortable in this situation. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells to keep his mood calm in our flat and if I try to create any distance between us (going in the other room, leaving the flat, staying at a friends) because I feel uncomfortable, he kicks off more, threatens to break things, hurt me, or physically stops me from leaving. 

Does this count as abuse or not because of his diagnosis?

I don't know how to start looking at myself in an objective point of view to figure this out. I could really use some help or advice. I don't want to be justified or told that this may be normal.

I (f25) and my boyfriend (m26) were having an argument while drunk. I went to bed while he still drank more in the kitchen. He came in and grabbed my phone and told me I was cheating. I let him take it to check it. When he couldn‚Äôt find anything he threw my phone at me. I grabbed it and immediately called an uber to my mom‚Äôs. He grabbed my phone again and asked me where I was going, I told him not to worry about it because I want to leave. He grabbed my phone and threw it on the floor and started stumping on it, breaking it. I got up from bed and when I reached down to grab it he reached down too and I pushed him away from it. He pushed me and took my phone, at this point I was afraid and I rant to the neighbors and asked them to call the police because he had taken my phone and was breaking it. The police came and they wanted to take pictures of me, I told them i didn‚Äôt want that, I just wanted my phone back to go to my moms. The cop said okay and then told me to put my hands behind my back. I was extremely confused because I hadn‚Äôt hurt him. 

I spent the weekend in jail and was ordered to not contact him which is fine because I no longer wanted to and I definitely do not want to go back to jail.

I am now 4 years into my failing marriage but even back then deep down something inside me saw it as foreshadowing or maybe even the reality of my marriage but I was not ready to accept it. It just looked like poetry when I placed the pieces in my ring dish so I just took the photo‚Ä¶ and stayed for another two years.

I read that one way to work through cognitive dissonance is to write down everything that person has done to hurt you. It makes it real. It makes it undeniable.

It's been over 2 years since I last saw my ex that would have killed me, and I was finally starting to feel like I would give dating another chance. I matched with the hottest guy on Hinge, we texted all the time until we went out (art museum evening date) and he was really sweet and we talked for 7 hours straight that night. We hooked up and it was definitely a little rough but super normal as far as what guys my age and type are into (and I'm fine with it).

We didn't see eachother for a few weeks but talked on the phone, he never made the conversation sexual at all but he came over last week and it felt like he was a completely different person. I was still recovering from a concussion (from my neighbor holding my head underwater, long story) and I told him that, and he still pressured me into giving him head. I didn't explicitly say no so I don't hold that against him, but after he was done I kept telling things about how my life had been going with school, internship searching, friends etc. and he would interrupt what I was saying to do really degrading things. 

Important to note this is a second date, he pulled a roll of duct tape sized electrical tape out of his bag and was like 'how do you want to be tied up' and I said uhhh...maybe another time, 15 min later he tried putting these white tablets in my mouth and I freaked out even when he said they were mints and he had one. I was talking about switching my major (we're both lying on my bed) and he just looks at me in the eye and spits on my face.

A couple days went by, I was really upset because prior to anything physical he had said he's looking for something long term and he could see us being really good together, and so for him to act like he did after saying that shattered my heart. He texted asking how I was, and I said I wasn't great and that I didn't think we would be happy together because we have very different perspectives on intimacy. He responded with the sweetest message back. 

I feel like I made the wrong decision, like because I already have PTSD maybe I was overreacting or something. I guess I'm just looking for advice because if it was really 'just a sex thing' I think I could communicate boundaries with him. I also know that I might be addicted to the way he made me see myself, or that all I've ever known is intimate partner violence that was objectively much worse. I am so sad because this would have been the first guy that wasn't just using me as a punching bag and a sex doll. I miss him so much I can't stop thinking about it and I have no idea why.",2025-03-10 02:17:55,2025-03-17 02:06:00,all_new_posts

The first five we were extreme alcoholics where he would choke me almost every night, he's given me black eyes which I've gone to emergency room and lie and his begging behalf, dragged me around by my hair, punched my in the side of the head, etc. The only proof I had was a message between us after we got sober where he was admitting that he strangled me and ""is that all our relationship was going to be about"" as well as pictures from the black eye and me in a scrub and hospital room. I never said anything, or did anything because we were in a relationship together. It was finally after I got tired of all that on top of talking to girls behind my back, extreme verbal abuse, neglect, laziness. I found out from my oldest son who was his ""stepson"" that he was abusing him as well. Not as extreme but he shouldn't have ever put his hands on my son. I took him to court, showed what limited evidence I had. My kids were also interviewed by their lawyer but because they're minors there testimony is considered ""hear say"". I got granted five years of a more or less stay away order. We can text but only about our shared son (my youngest). I also have primary placement, all medical decisions, he pays child support. 

Why does it feel like it doesn't matter, and there's no justice for those who were brainwashed and abused. I'm in trauma therapy finally after waiting three years after leaving him. I want to get the ""stay away"" order extended but I don't think I will be able to.

After five years if he has good behavior can he take me back to court and get everything I was granted (aside from the stay away order). He has rather limited visitation too. ",2025-03-09 23:52:37,2025-03-17 02:06:02,all_new_posts

WEEK. that spans my entire right side from my armpit to my thigh from where he was kicking me while i was literally sleeping on the floor. i cant even move very well and ive considered going to the hospital because i keep having dark brown almost black blood as if i have my period but i dont. he called off work because i hit him. if i called off work every time he hit me, every time i bruised, was exhausted, hurting, aching, i wouldnt have a job because i dont remember a time in the last 6 years where i wasnt feeling absolutely horrible. before one bruise heals the next is already there.

basically i just feel like these people are such whiny babies, truly. the world revolves around them. they cant take what they dish. he cried last night to me and told me hes so sorry and he deserves it and all this shit. i didnt even entertain it, i was still riding the high from being able to jump on his back. hes very very tall and just generally big and i‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù so i felt like an action hero. he started crying louder and yelling at me and said something like ‚Äúim literally crying and begging for you to comfort me and youre walking away.‚Äù he was crying super loud so i said ‚Äúif i cried like that when you abuse me every single fucking day youd be in there yelling at me calling me a pussy and telling me to shut up. at least i keep my crying to myself. you sound like a baby‚Äù which just made him angry and the whole cycle started over again. the funniest part was seeing how his narcissistic ass acts when he gets what he dishes, even the tiniest little bit over all these years the first time i ever retaliated and this is how he acts?? nothing makes you feel more strong than seeing how someone else would handle your situation, especially the person who put you there. i live 400 miles from my mom now so i have nothing, i had to quit my job, i know nobody here. i havent talked to anyone i know since december last year, and i was thinking about reaching out my friend and he reacted like a baby, as expected. i guess being so completely isolated from everyone and everything made me go feral, but i‚Äôm still riding it. hopefully i can make him rethink the way he treats me and shift the power dynamic a little. the funniest thing by far was when he said i couldve killed him. from punching you in the face??? you literally stepped on my neck like.. two days ago. i felt something crack in the back of my head, and now ive had a headache ever since. god knows what he knocked out of place. you were so close to killing me and didnt care, and this is just the most recent time. i literally felt like laughing. i said something along the lines of.. ‚Äúyou think that couldve killed you? you come within inches of killing me multiple times a month and have no idea. some day you really could kill me and you‚Äôd be surprised because youre you stupid to know what youre doing.‚Äù obviously that didnt make him very happy. 

i wonder how long i can ride this high. theres been two fights since, and i didnt fight back, but i still feel so good from the night i did. i feel invincible.

My biological parents get along well, but just were not a good match. My father has dated a few people throughout my life, most ending fairly quickly. He began dating a woman about 4 years ago let‚Äôs just call her Miley (44F). Me and Miley did not get along from the start. This was not just usual stepmom stepdaughter rivalry, she made a point for me to know she hated me. It started with making fun of my clothing, and my dad‚Äôs. Honestly, I can‚Äôt recount every awful thing she‚Äôs said to me because I‚Äôve blocked most of it out. But it just got so much worse. My father moved me and him 100 miles away from home so we could be closer to his new girlfriend. Now all we had was her, and her family. This family owns a mega church in the city, and three companies, they‚Äôre everywhere. The family has so many deep rooted issues. My father decided it would be best for us to move in with Miley so we could all have a ‚Äúhappy family‚Äù I refused this idea and my father was upset with me because he thought I was just being petty, I knew it was a bad decision. So we moved in with Miley. Things got so bad. She set up cameras in our living room, hallway to my bedroom, and in her son‚Äôs (11M) game room. She commonly watched me for no reason on these and would make comments just to frazzle me on these cameras (through the microphone). She made sure to let me know her sons did not want me living with them and did not like me. She also told me how her son‚Äôs biological father did not like me, because he did not like how I moved in with them (like it‚Äôs my choice?) One day I got home and found my bed covered in pee, and then all my stuff animals, my laundry baskets, and even worse ALL MY LINGERIE. I instantly knew it was her son, her son commonly shits in closets in the house and blames it on the dogs, and like that he blames this on the dogs. 
I was going crazy and told my dad and he was enraged, when he spoke to Miley about it she said she can‚Äôt do anything and it‚Äôs not her fault because it‚Äôs her son who did it not her, her son refuses to admit he did it, and she does not let me or my father speak to him about it. After, Miley crashed her car into mine well pulling out of the driveway, who knows if this was on purpose, when it happened I called my father to express how upset I was and on the cameras she listened to the entire conversation then ridiculed me and my father for talking about her. (My dad had to pay for the entire repair of the car, Miley did not give a dime)
Miley blamed my father for this, that he was too dramatic. Now going forward things got so much worse. 
Miley makes fun of everything my father does, refuses to eat his meals, refuses to be close to him, and refuses to tell him anything that‚Äôs going on.
Miley sets up situations to embarrass my father, and to stress him out. She will commonly try shit talking MY OWN FATHER with me which I do not. Even Miley‚Äôs  own family has admitted to me that they know she is awful to my father. She screams at my dad if he tries disciplining to her kids at all, even though she screams at me constantly for everything I do. 
My father‚Äôs family is scared for him and wants him to leave her, but he is financially stuck since he helped pay for her house to be renovated and now has no money left. 

I know some may say that this does not sound abusive, but please remember I am the child and do not see much they hide a lot of it from me. My dad is numb, and a shell of who he used to be. I am scared for him and what I am wondering is if I should graduate so we can move away because I think he is only staying so I can go to school in the city Miley lives in. 

I love my dad and I want him to be happy again, I am scared. ",2025-03-09 22:12:34,2025-03-17 02:06:06,all_new_posts

Basically, he jokes around that he'll beat me sometimes for not doing a piece of housework, and has even joked about ""killing"" the cat, when she has annoyed him. He'll also laugh way too much at when watching sitcoms at night, as if I'm not around, even though my room is next door to he. He also admits it's fun fooling around with me because he knows I don't really like it and  knows I think it's kind of stupid of him to act like a child.

He'll actually throw a fit if the cat legitimately does something wrong, or if he has to unexpectedly to waste his time on even a minor setback on a long or busy day, even if the request has a legitimate point. Not to mention he seems barely capable of internalizing his anger. He'll also shove me out of his room and tell me not to bother him or hang out unless I actually need something or playing around with the kitty in his room.  He's also joked around my sister and uncle taking me to live with them. Oh, and another thing, one of is more annoying habits is he NEVER throws away any dirty food packaging in the trash after it has been used. I always have to throw it away, even though he lectures me about not letting bugs in the house.  
It's annoying, and I can't really stand it, knowing that he'll react badly if I put my time over his. Is this something of concern?",2025-03-09 20:49:31,2025-03-17 02:06:09,all_new_posts

I have a temporary PFA against my ex. I was granted residency of my house. The police escorted him out and arrested him on outstanding warrants. 

The evening he was bonded out he went to my house. He took everything out of his car (bags of clothes and papers) and piled it on the porch. He also broke my doorbell camera off the house. 
I did call the police and they initially told me on the phone the PFA was against me specifically and didn't have an address on it. I told them it did and I was granted residency.
 The officer did call me back and apologize. He ""didn't have all the information"" when he talked to me the first time. They also let him drive away in his car with a suspended license. They did write up the violation and texted me the case number. 
Now my question is what do I do about him messaging me everyday. He has also called a few times. Nothing abusive but he goes back and forth between being mad at me and then trying to get me to talk to him or meet up with him. I have not replied or answered at all. 
Court for the PFA hearing is next week. Do I call 911 for every message/call as a violation? Or just keep collecting evidence and show it to the judge?

I instantly switched and went to whatever force was needed to get him to stop. I picked up a wood plank and just kept going until he stopped.

I basically beat the crap out of my husband the moment he started to attack me. It‚Äôs like I switched and was out for blood, I didn‚Äôt even care if he would have hurt me more than I did him.

He had the GALL to complain to me about his arm hurting after I went ham. Like‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry. What? You want to fight someone and not get hurt? 

Ahh! But you wanted to fight someone you thought was weaker than you and THAT‚Äôs why you‚Äôre upset you got hurt!!!

Fucking idiot. 

I feel weird about NOT feeling guilty. It‚Äôs like I suddenly realized how freaking pathetic he really is, the moment he started complaining to me about what got hurt. 

Excuse me??? You want me to feel sorry for you‚Ä¶ After you literally FREAKING attacked me???

Like ummm? If I had been a dude and you got hurt in a fight with me you wouldn‚Äôt be complaining üôÇ 

I started making fun of him a shit ton later on. Like ‚Äúuuuuww I tried to beat my woman and she hurt me back uwwww‚Äù like you are pathetic. PATHETIC!!!

This weekend, she missed my niece's birthday which would've been the first time we've seen her since Thanksgiving, and she's been telling us for months that was when we would see her again. She is unable to tell me why she didn't come and is turning her phone off instead of telling me why. She says she wants to leave him, but I am really struggling to see that at this point; she's evasive and honestly acts like she's afraid. He won't let her go to counseling, he won't let her drive herself, and won't let me drive to pick her up. She is terrified when I tell her that I'm gonna tell someone about all this and threatens to not talk to me anymore if I do. I am DESPERATE for some resources, locally or of any kind at all. Someone that could call her? A crisis interventionist type situation? anything is worth a shot at this point. Thanks in advance. ",2025-03-09 15:45:06,2025-03-17 02:06:15,all_new_posts

I always knew the signs, the cycle, what it looks like. I guess I thought I would be better prepared to know what to do if it came down to it. My friend is poor, can‚Äôt find a job, lives with her physically disabled dad and is only 19. She met a boy that she‚Äôs been seeing for around 6 months maybe more or less, he helps out with her financially since her father is unable to provide things like groceries etc (as well as letting her use his car since she can‚Äôt afford one). She‚Äôs a long distance friend i‚Äôve known for over 5 years at this point, she lives in the States and she became pregnant with him (by accident of course) For the past few months he‚Äôs been abusing her in more ways than one, he‚Äôs cut off my contact with her because he went through our messages where she told me some things he‚Äôs done and I told her to leave him. She‚Äôs facetimed me showing me bruises only to rush off the phone because he came back, he helps himself to come over without an invite or heads up and told her she has to leave the window unlocked so he can enter at any time. He is ALWAYS over and it seems impossible to reach out with her because she‚Äôs asked me to not text her anything involving him and I can‚Äôt ask if he‚Äôs over either. So I never know if it‚Äôs safe to reach out or not. He‚Äôs texted me off her phone as well as other people pretending to be her and lecturing her friends for disrespecting him (while he‚Äôs texting as her) He‚Äôs controlling, dangerous (owns a firearm), manipulative, physically abusive, will punish her with dangerous things such as driving them out somewhere while she‚Äôs drunk and forcing her to drive back home intoxicated. She can‚Äôt afford an abortion on her own and last I heard she was staying with him so he could pay for one (it‚Äôs around $500 where she lives) But I recently called her briefly when he stepped out of the room but she said she couldn‚Äôt talk about it but she normally would so I think he was still with her and told her to say he wasn‚Äôt (i‚Äôm not supposed to know she‚Äôs pregnant). Apart of this was me needing to rant out of frustration for not being able to help, but also advice. I‚Äôm heartbroken that after all i‚Äôve been through I have absolutely no clue what to do or how to help. I feel like I forgot everything I once knew about these situations. I considered giving her an ultimatum to leave him or or I stop being her friend soley with the hope and intention it wakes her up because she can live without his money (not easily) and it‚Äôs been so frustrating watching this all snowball and progressively get worse and worse, she once told me I barely know half of the bad things he‚Äôs done and I can barely imagine.

I‚Äôm tired of the cycle of abuse I‚Äôm in and want it to end but I don‚Äôt know where to start or what to do. I (24, F) have been with my partner (27, M) for over two years. This is my first ‚Äúadult‚Äù relationship outside of my high school ones so I let a lot of things slide because I was in love with this person. One of them being the physical and emotional abuse from them. For a year and a half, I have denied to myself that I was even in an abuse relationship. Lying to friends and family about certain bruises on me. I thought it would stop, he would change, and that it wasn‚Äôt as bad as I thought it was. That I was soft. 

It started to get worse since he moved in with me a year ago. I want it to be over, I feel like I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I‚Äôm going back and forward with even making this post. I want to speak up, tell someone, do something to make this stop. But there‚Äôs this part of me that feels guilty, and I know it‚Äôs only because I have love for this person. I‚Äôm asking myself is all this pain really worth the ‚Äúlove‚Äù I‚Äôm getting? 

Kicking him out isn‚Äôt enough, because he talks his way back and I don‚Äôt have the strength to stick to my word. I have kicked him out, tried cutting him off, but I bend back to his will each time. The only reason I never went to the authorities is because I never wanted to do that to him. I couldn‚Äôt go through with putting him through that situation. It sounds silly as I write it but I just couldn‚Äôt get myself to speak up. I barely started speaking about it in therapy, but refer it as past abuse and not current. Again afraid of authorities getting involved. 

Today he went too far. And now I‚Äôm thinking that getting authorities involved is the only way to make it stop. But I have no idea where to start, what do I say? I have been keeping photo evidence of my bruises and certain videos of his behaviors. It was mainly to show him proof that he is hurting me. He would be drunk most times and forget he had hands on me. 

Would I have to face him or court or is this something that could be resolved without me facing him? Do I need some kind of lawyer? I just have no idea about all these next steps. I always avoided the topics and resources because I felt like I wasn‚Äôt going through what I thought I was. 

So I mainly just want an idea of what I should do, what I should expect and what the outcomes would be. I‚Äôm from Southern California. I do know my local police station and number. I have records of photos, videos and therapy sessions. This is all I have so far. I know I could look up this information but I want advice from those who had been through this, and the support to get out of this abusive relationship. Anything will help, thank you.

I know my choice is to go through with an abortion, but now I‚Äôm grappling with the decision of contacting him and the emotional turmoil of wondering if I‚Äôve made the wrong choice. For the past few days, I‚Äôve convinced myself that maybe he really was my soulmate, despite everything we went through.

He had a suspended license for over a year and just got it back a few days ago and with his new freedom he's been more bold and confident.

He told me he will deport me if I won‚Äôt shut up. Sometimes throwing me on the floor, grabbing my neck. Sometimes he drives drunk and now gets upset when I refuse to go with him. Now he says he doesn‚Äôt care, he lied me about our relationship and my immigration, claiming that he just felt pity for me that left me heartbroken. 
There is nothing left from me. I don‚Äôt feel myself as a human being. He told me to leave if I want. Is he lying again and will threat me after that I don‚Äôt know.
I want to die to be honest. I‚Äôm completely alone without anybody anywhere. 
I wish he could kill me or something will happen and my existence will end.

1j6sxo8,Is this emotional abuse?,SweetSea3399,9,2025-03-08 22:36:08+00:00,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j6sxo8/is_this_emotional_abuse/,"I was married for several years, recently divorced. I don‚Äôt think my ex is a bad person. However, the church we were in saw men as the ‚Äúfinal say‚Äù in everything, and women were asked to be ‚Äúsubmissive.‚Äù My ex and I were more liberal than most on this, but it was still ultimately the belief. 

Before we got married, I became more worried about my looks. He liked my makeup to be done certain ways. On the first night of our honeymoon, he laughed at me when I came out in lingerie. He said it just didn‚Äôt fit right and he thought I was trying to be silly. It was a pretty bold choice, but this being my first time, I felt like that was not very kind. He couldn‚Äôt believe how much I held onto that experience. Often, when I was downstairs and ready to go somewhere, he would look at me with disapproval because he didn‚Äôt feel like my outfit was flattering or coordinated. I would often change. Mostly, I chose my outfits to try to please him. He would often come shopping with me and help me decide what to buy. He said he liked my style, but he always seemed like he was trying to hone it to be more like his style. 

When I would get hurt, he would suddenly get really mad and yell, though it would usually dissipate quickly. This especially happened if he had told me not to do something and then I did it (even accidentally) and ended up getting hurt. He said he just didn‚Äôt want to see me hurt. At first, he wouldn‚Äôt let me go to coffee, lunch, etc. with male coworkers because he ‚Äúworried about what they might do.‚Äù Over time, he loosened up on that, but he did always want to know where I was. I turned on location sharing for a bit, but I got tired of being asked about me going to get coffee or ice cream. 

He got upset with me when I would poke fun at him around other people or say anything negative about him. He said it was disrespectful. So I stopped sharing anything negative about him. We were around my family a lot, but he didn‚Äôt like me asking them for advice on things, because he felt he should be the leader and not them. He felt they didn‚Äôt need to be involved in our decisions in that way. When I would go somewhere with someone one on one and would tell him about the conversation we had, he would ask for the exact wording I used for certain things and then get frustrated if I didn‚Äôt remember or get upset with me for saying things in a way that didn‚Äôt reflect well on him or us. Eventually, I got to the point where I felt like he was the only person who understood me, but somehow now I wonder if that might have had to do with me having to filter conversations with everyone else to match his preferences.

He would tell me that if we didn‚Äôt have sex often enough it would cause him to ‚Äústumble‚Äù and look at other women sexually. He would get frustrated/grumpy if we didn‚Äôt have sex every 2-3 days. On my period, I was ideally expected to please him in some way, even if I didn‚Äôt want to have sex. He only actually kept going when I said ‚Äúno‚Äù one time, I think. I confronted him about it, and he did feel bad about it and didn‚Äôt do it again. However, he then was kind of insistent that he ‚Äúwanted me to want it‚Äù but would still get frustrated if it wasn‚Äôt happening every few days. He would also still want to at least have one hand touching me while we slept, even if I told him I didn‚Äôt feel like being touched right then. He would often touch me when we were just living our lives, and it would make me jump or cringe at times.

Some friends tell me that some of the things he did sound like emotional abuse, but others would say that he was a great guy and these things are fairly normal levels of control. He did help a lot around the house, he supported me through grad school, and he was kind. But somehow these things seemed to chip away at my sense of self.

It was served today. They took his guns and evicted him from the house. I KNOW it was justified but I feel terrible because he was in complete denial and continually said there were no issues in the relationship and I was the only one who had problems with things. So he was in complete shock when I left even though I spoke with him about things needing to change many times. The DVPO was, I‚Äôm sure, an even bigger shock as he does not think there is anything wrong with the way he acts/is in denial/was too drunk to remember what he did. I feel like a monster.

I'm supposed to call on Monday to talk to a family coach. I would have called them yesterday, but I couldn't find the privacy and if he knew it would most likely turn into a horrible argument if he found out.

He turns into such a monster if he isn't getting from me what he wants. Other times it just builds slowly like over a span of days or weeks. Like he'll get impatient over something he thinks I'm doing too slowly and will use a tone that sounds kind of rude. Then maybe that day or days later he'll make a snide comment, but then switch quickly to humor so I'm unsure if I understand what he said and meant by it correctly. Usually his next display is saying something mean about an activity I'm doing or planning. Like if I say I'm going to get the mail, he say something about how I have mail all over the place and it makes the house look like crap. 

If I bring to his attention how he's acting rudely I never know which way it will go. He might say sorry, might blow it off, but usually he'll switch to a sensitive topic like he'll say ""let's go to the bedroom."" Why would I want to be intimate when he's being rude? On top of that I still have all the other stuff in my head that never gets resolved. 

So then I decline his offer and the fight is on. He'll start accusing me of going somewhere and meeting with someone and then point out times in the past that were normal regular situations and accuse them of being something different where I was with someone else or planning it. If I stand up to his manipulations he gets really mad and that's when the abuse goes up a few notches.

I'm so tired of it.",2025-03-08 17:47:14,2025-03-17 02:06:28,all_new_posts

1j6fl1n,I know my relationship is abusive & I can‚Äôt leave,Illustrious_Elk_7292,21,2025-03-08 11:53:25+00:00,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j6fl1n/i_know_my_relationship_is_abusive_i_cant_leave/,"
(Warning long post sorry)

I am 22, my boyfriend is 28, I am 34 weeks pregnant with his child and we have been together for only a year. I‚Äôve never had feelings so strongly for someone so quick, to me he was the biggest sweetheart I‚Äôve ever met but I could tell from the get go there were a few red flags.

Our relationship sort of consisted of going out, drinking and doing drugs before I got pregnant, he‚Äôs also got another child he can‚Äôt see for unknown reasons. He tried pressuring me to get an abortion but I felt so much love for the baby and it just changed something in me instantly so I didn‚Äôt go ahead, it didn‚Äôt matter to me whether he was there or not because I knew I could handle it on my own.

In the last few months, our relationship has completely deteriorated. Whenever he drinks, he all of a sudden hates me and wants to hurt me.

The first time it happened (probs around 16 weeks into my pregnancy), we were at a pub with my parents, we went home as normal and then something switched in him. He started saying really hurtful things sending me into a panic attack and getting aggressive for not letting him drive drunk, he ended up driving very erratically and I was scared for my life and vomited on myself which he called me disgusting for, and grabbed my arm so hard and twisted it, then threatened to break my arm because I wanted to jump out of the car. When we got home he threatened to break my laptop and pushed me over. 

I have had 4 other situations similar to this, which he denies ever happened.

The fact that he doesn‚Äôt admit it, has made me insane to the point I can‚Äôt leave him alone because I just want some kind of closure. I feel absolutely crazy and selfish for risking the babies health because I can‚Äôt manage my emotions and leave the relationship. I love her so much and I get so angry with myself when I let him do this again, I don‚Äôt know why I trust that he won‚Äôt. I hate myself.

I love him when he‚Äôs sober, I can‚Äôt bare the fact he is like this now and I hate him so much but I still hold on to that version of him that once made me so happy but I know he‚Äôs gone.

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. How do you move on without getting the closure you want so bad and accepting that person you once loved is gone? My family physically abused me and did this to me growing up also which is really triggering üòï",2025-03-08 11:53:25,2025-03-17 02:06:30,all_new_posts

(Drove home, somehow) He got upset at me for ‚Äúcoming in hot‚Äù when I came downstairs after he got home to get some ibuprofen for a headache and asked why the kitchen door was closed off. 

He escalated things super quickly, clearly wanting to argue. Within 5 minutes he was calling me a see you next Tuesday and saying he doesn‚Äôt want to be with me. He will jump to this during arguments and I have told him this upsets me because it seems he can just throw our nearly six year relationship away by being that cavalier about it. 

Almost out of nowhere he starts yelling and cursing at me. Shouting he doesn‚Äôt want to be near me. The volume of his shouting is almost making the house shake. Then takes a large shelving unit and tosses it around our back room. Breaks multiple items, and then starts to shove it towards me where I‚Äôm standing backed in a corner asking him to stop. Our back room is destroyed from this outburst. 

I am physically fine and in a safe part of the house for the night. He has texted me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so so sorry. I want to be with you and shouldn‚Äôt have said that.‚Äù 
The physical escalation of this fight brought it to another level for me. I feel heartbroken. This is out of character to get this aggressive, but I‚Äôm wondering what to do from here (after tonight). ",2025-03-08 07:13:56,2025-03-17 02:06:31,all_new_posts

I left my abuser about a year and a half ago. I‚Äôve been feeling stronger, more like myself and overall, I think I get better everyday. I recently started dating again and at first I felt great.

But sometimes, like when she doesn‚Äôt share certain things with me in the moment, or does normal things like hang out with friends or want to visit her family without me... I get upset. I know that doing those things is normal, and even though she shows me in many ways that she loves me, I, once again, feel like I‚Äôm not enough. My ex hid everything from me, he even hid me from his family for a looong time, he didn‚Äôt consider me or my feelings in his plans (even if they‚Äôd affect me too). Well, add the violence to that, I just felt that I didn‚Äôt know him at all, and in a very sick and sad way, many times I felt that maybe he just didn‚Äôt love me because Im not worth loving (I think differently now but my feelings apparently haven‚Äôt catch up to reason yet). I don‚Äôt know how to explain this to my partner. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs fair for me to ask her to share more, at the end it‚Äôs not on her to solve my anxiety I guess. Does anyone have any advice?

About a month ago, i noticed a rapid decline in my mental health and I realized it‚Äôs because i knew he was guilty but everyone else thought he was a saint and i overall just felt isolated etc. That‚Äôs when i decided to make a report including EVERYTHING. i honestly have never had an encounter with law enforcement or the canadian legal system previously so i was not expecting anything to come from this, i had fully prepared myself to become another unfortunate statistic, a few days after my report a DV/SA investigator reached out and met with me the next day (2 days ago now) and i told her everything from the abuse, to the stalking and his previous behaviours before me. She told me afterwards that I had enough evidence alone to take him to court which i opted for, another victim i had spoken to previously regarding my situation came forward with her story. The next day, the same investigator i had spoken to arrested him and he was later released with specific conditions until his first appearance in court. I‚Äôm not exactly sure on his exact conditions besides he isn‚Äôt allowed to contact me directly or indirectly but i was informed that he was a student at my college (while in our relationship he had failed his program and was not planning on going back) Considering the fact that he stalked me and threatened to harm himself when i attempted to end the relationship, i have no doubt in my mind that now he knows where i work (he was told he isn‚Äôt allowed at the hospital where i work unless he‚Äôs personally having a medical emergency) he will break his conditions now that he has a reason to confront me. I‚Äôm having so many mixed feelings, I haven‚Äôt slept in two days because i can‚Äôt stop thinking about how this is affecting his family ( they treated me like  family for two years and i still have empathy for them) I know i should be thinking about myself but im having such a hard time (his family teaches/attends at my college so running into them in inevitable, i did contact both my work and my professors to create a safety plan which they have been so supportive) Im so terrified to leave my house or do anything nor do i have the energy or mental capacity to do so. Im honestly still in shock, I was not expecting the police to do anything given all of the horror stories ive heard, Im having such a hard time processing how he gets to live his life normally until court in May as he‚Äôs still actively destroying me and it‚Äôs been two years since we began the relationship. 

Im sorry this is so long, i honestly just needed to get these thoughts out. If anyone has any recommendations or suggestions please feel free to reach out ",2025-03-08 01:58:43,2025-03-17 02:06:38,all_new_posts

I hadn't spoken to him for about 20 hours when he called me, cursing, saying I'm not his responsibility, and then flipped the switch, as narcissists do, and refused to give me my things. So, I called 911 to report the items as stolen. The police advised me to get a protective order, so I went to court, filled out all the paperwork, but the judge denied it. She asked me two vague questions and based her decision on that. I feel discouraged because I thought this was my chance to be heard and to finally get justice. I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed, and honestly, I feel too young to be dealing with all of this.

Should I appeal this decision on Monday? His friends have been reaching out to me, and he has a large Doberman and a gun.

My partner of 10 years has had fits of violent anger occasionally throughout our time together. Things have escalated in the past several weeks. He grew up in an abusive and excessively strict home and has worked in similar environments (restaurant industry) and has never really unpacked the impact of that so I understand why he needs things a certain way or feels disregulated. I try very hard but can be clumsy and forgetful, I'm an anxious person and always thinking about a million things which keeps me from being as present in my body or on the task right in front of me. I understand that it's frustrating to him and might feel like I don't care or I'm not trying. But when I don't clean a dish completely perfectly or accidentally break something or put something away not folded exactly as he had it, he really lashes out (""you dumbass motherfucker can't do anything right and irk my whole soul!""). Right now this is happening at least once a day and then he'll tell me I ruined the whole day. In the past I've tried to talk to him about it with compassion and understanding of his past but also trying to say his actions aren't okay and that he can communicate differently. He doesn't really apologize or take accountability and always comes back to how draining my incompetence is. I've gotten to a point where I just shut down and don't say anything back, I fix whatever the mistake is silently and leave the room, but I think it just makes him think I'm more pathetic. 

I'm feeling pathetic too because I know I don't want to be treated this way but there's so much I love about and don't feel ready to give up on in my life with him. I also am starting to feel really childish (I'm in my 30s) and dependent for making so many mistakes or doing things imperfectly. I've worked really hard to keep from internalizing his words, I also can see that the more pressure he puts the more I fumble as I'm more on edge (he tells me that's an excuse), but my internal boundaries and voice are also failing me and I am hating on myself a lot right now. 

He wouldn't stop me from leaving (maybe he'd even be happy about it-which also makes me feel pathetic) and I'm thinking about it a bit but I just don't feel ready, it's going to be a lot to grieve. There's also a part of me that wants to figure out and fix what is wrong with me that I can't do things ""right"" (even if I don't think it's a binary or that his standards are inherently right) because I can understand why if he needs to micromanage me why that's exhausting and frustrating.

I have been the sole parent managing every aspect of my child‚Äôs life. My son has autism, and I handle all of his medical care, therapy, IEP meetings, school issues, and daily routines‚Äîcompletely alone. His father has always been in his life, but he has never been a real parent. He has never taken responsibility for Ryder‚Äôs healthcare, disability services, therapy, or even his basic day-to-day needs. I have done everything. He has every other weekend access.

I am in a parenting agreement I never wanted. When I was able to afford a lawyer, I had already filed for joint  due to the coercive control. It was the only way to end some means of the abuse and two years later, even with the court mandated app it‚Äôs still happens. I have worked with domestic violence advocates. I have everything documented, but it just seems like no one cares. I have primary custody, was never married and have final say if we can‚Äôt agree. Which is inappropriate for our situation because he has never collaborated or educated himself on our child‚Äôs disability/ raising a child.  

I also have a temporary restraining order against his father and need to protect myself and my son. The OOP was only granted to me, court is coming up. Again, another lawyer that says ‚Äújust keep documenting‚Äù. Being fully dedicated to my son‚Äôs care while losing everything is exhausting. I feel trapped. The school district we are in isn‚Äôt great with truly being inclusive. 

I need to relocate out of New York State to a place where we can be safe and where my son will have access to better autism services and schools. But I know I need to do this the right way legally, especially with custody involved. I own my home but can‚Äôt afford it. My savings have all ran out and I had to resign from getting back to work for the first time since becoming mama because lack of support and exhaustion.

One of my mothers good friends who I grew up around and spent a lot of time with as a kid, was murdered by her eldest son. 

I used to babysit this child, he‚Äôs the same age as my nephew. He was always a problem child, he even tried to suffocate his baby brother when he was like 5 or 6 years old. 

His mother, Astrid was the kindest most soft spoken sweet gentle woman and one of my mother‚Äôs friends that I particular favored as she was always so nice to us. I‚Äôve known her since I was about 8 years old, I‚Äôm over 30. She and her husband were a great couple. Loving parents. Loving spouses. He was also very sweet.  
My mother knew her since before she got married and had her kids and this family. Now we are watching this gut wrenching news that her family has ended and been torn apart in this way. 

They are giving the mentally health excuse but I feel the kid is just evil. A psychopath. While mental health has something to do with it, obviously‚Ä¶.i do believe he knew what he was doing. I feel sick to my stomach. My mother is devastated and I can‚Äôt begin to imagine how her husband (who found her dead) feels as well as her other younger son.

For reference, I ended my relationship in June 2024, after 2 years of domestic violence,manipulation, SA and emotional abuse. About a month ago, i noticed a rapid decline in my mental health and I realized it‚Äôs because i knew he was guilty but everyone else thought he was a saint and i overall just felt isolated etc. That‚Äôs when i decided to make a report including EVERYTHING. i honestly have never had an encounter with law enforcement or the canadian legal system previously so i was not expecting anything to come from this, i had fully prepared myself to become another unfortunate statistic, a few days after my report a DV/SA investigator reached out and met with me the next day (2 days ago now) and i told her everything from the abuse, to the stalking and his previous behaviours before me. She told me afterwards that I had enough evidence alone to take him to court which i opted for, another victim i had spoken to previously regarding my situation came forward with her story. The next day, the same investigator i had spoken to arrested him and he was later released with specific conditions until his first appearance in court. I‚Äôm not exactly sure on his exact conditions besides he isn‚Äôt allowed to contact me directly or indirectly but i was informed that he was a student at my college (while in our relationship he had failed his program and was not planning on going back) Considering the fact that he stalked me and threatened to harm himself when i attempted to end the relationship, i have no doubt in my mind that now he knows where i work (he was told he isn‚Äôt allowed at the hospital where i work unless he‚Äôs personally having a medical emergency) he will break his conditions now that he has a reason to confront me. I‚Äôm having so many mixed feelings, I haven‚Äôt slept in two days because i can‚Äôt stop thinking about how this is affecting his family ( they treated me like  family for two years and i still have empathy for them) I know i should be thinking about myself but im having such a hard time (his family teaches/attends at my college so running into them in inevitable, i did contact both my work and my professors to create a safety plan which they have been so supportive) Im so terrified to leave my house or do anything nor do i have the energy or mental capacity to do so. Im honestly still in shock, I was not expecting the police to do anything given all of the horror stories ive heard, Im having such a hard time processing how he gets to live his life normally until court in May as he‚Äôs still actively destroying me and it‚Äôs been two years since we began the relationship. 

Im sorry this is so long, i honestly just needed to get these thoughts out. If anyone has any recommendations or suggestions please feel free to reach out ",2025-03-07 03:57:11,2025-03-17 02:06:49,all_new_posts

Despite my attorney warning his attorney, and me warning him over email that if he continues to do this, we will get an RO against him. He continued to enter my home at least 3-4 times after, again despite my attorney's reminders to his.

We have been living separately for 6 months now and I filed for divorce in Jan this year.

These incidents happened ~ 1 month ago, and at the time my then attorney was dead against filing a DVRO. I changed attorneys, and the new one is open to the idea.

However, I have sent emails to him using abusive language in the last year. Also about a year ago, tired of his abuse over 16 years, I sent him an email saying I will break his head into a million pieces, and he responded saying he is locking himself up in his study for his safety and if I come near him he will get a restraining order. Of course nothing happened.

I have called the cops on him twice last year- once for him threatening to ""bring me to the road"" and another one for yelling like a madman- extremely threateningly at me.

He also ran away with our kids passports one day before scheduled travel last May, and then continued to withhold my access of them for months.

Given that the barging incident happened a while ago, and he seems to be behaving himself since then- can I still file for a DVRO and obtain it? Also can he file a counter DVRO using me (reactive) abusive emails? I'm very scared for my safety given his aggression. I switched attorneys recently and can use that to file DVRO saying I was trying to find a competent and supportive attorney and couldn't file earlier because of that?",2025-03-07 03:24:13,2025-03-17 02:06:51,all_new_posts

1j55wdq,Long vent. Exhausted and frustrated with it all,IllMango552,2,2025-03-06 20:57:00+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j55wdq/long_vent_exhausted_and_frustrated_with_it_all/,"Just needing to vent, I‚Äôm frustrated with the legal system and dealing with the fact that there will likely be minimal consequences.

I dated her for about three months and when I ended things, it all went to hell. Suddenly she‚Äôs pregnant, then having a miscarriage. All the tests came back negative and she was drinking before telling me she was pregnant but after she said she knew she was pregnant. She‚Äôs the  showing up at my job to talk to my boss, coming by my apartment unannounced (repeatedly) to attempt to enter and talk to me while also assaulting me in the process. I got texts and instagram messages from her and her friends about how terrible a person I was.

I got a protection order, which she promptly violated to vandalize my car twice, attempting to hire a locksmith to break into my apartment, confronting me in the courthouse to say she was going to file false rape allegations of I pursued the protection order. I moved and she bought a new car and followed me to my new place and slashed my tires, stole my Amazon packages, and then attempted to use a drill to break through the back door. I had set up a camera by this point and she got arrested and is facing charges.

I‚Äôm of the opinion the charges are the weakest possible ones they could get away with giving her. Two misdemeanor charges for violating a protection order and criminal tampering for trying to drill out the video camera because there wasn‚Äôt sufficient damage. Her plea bargain, I‚Äôm being told, is a very standard DV offer of 24 months probation with screening for DV counseling.

I just feel deflated since the DA‚Äôs office gives me a runaround whenever I try to talk to them. They say I have the right as the crime victim to consult with them at certain stages and they just don‚Äôt contact me until it‚Äôs too late and say ‚Äúoops, we can do better, what a good learning opportunity for us!‚Äù

I just feel powerless in the whole process. I feel I‚Äôm constantly looking over my shoulder. She lies to the court about her location so she can attend virtually. I attend the hearings in person so I can give a victim impact statement to try to make there be a modicum of consequences. She‚Äôs talking about moving out of state to go home and I doubt the probation will be serious enough to travel, since it‚Äôs a misdemeanor. I‚Äôm exhausted with how this drags on and how nothing has happened to her except one night in jail.

There have been minimal consequences for her, and I feel incredibly limited since as a male victim I have to be IMMACULATE in my behavior or else there will be the defense twisting it that I‚Äôm not an angel and she‚Äôll get off completely Scot-free. I just don‚Äôt know what to do and need to vent about this.

He was at our house a few months before my mother put him out & he went to a homeless shelter in my city where‚Äôs he been living ever since. As I said theres been issues in the relationship already as far as countless arguments, name calling, controlling behavior etc. It started getting physical back in July. We‚Äôve had at least 4  physical altercations in the past 8-9 months. A few days ago we went to the bar together. I got up to use the bathroom and when I came back there was another man sitting quite close to him but he was talking to the bartender so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I sat down and my boyfriend kept telling me to move over but I thought he was being funny so I didn‚Äôt. The man at the bar started arguing with everyone my boyfriend included. My boyfriend then started getting more aggressive with the man AND ME, calling me a bitch and saying he‚Äôll slap me in front of everyone. We left like 10-15 mins later. He said I wasn‚Äôt on his side and was trying to get attention from the other men and kept talking about how bad he would‚Äôve beaten the man in the bar.. as we‚Äôre walking to my house he‚Äôs talking shit to me and I‚Äôm trying to ignore him. He eventually hits me in the back of my head while standing in front of me trying to prevent me from going another way. He walked the whole way home about 4 blocks just hitting me. Pulling my hair.. pushing me.. actually ended up pushing me down to the ground in the snow and mud and when I said it was over he snatched my purse and my phone.

Sometimes the physical abuse was sprinkled here and there. For the most part, everything was the verbal, mental and emotional. 

My ex husband always wanted me thinner than what I was. He saw pictures of me in college and said that if I could have been that skinny for my ex, I could be that skinny for him, too. Mind you, I went from taking dancing classes, walking all over campus, and barely sitting to ONLY sitting at a desk 8 hours of the day. So of course I gained weight. Mind you, at the time we got together, I was 160lbs at 5‚Äô6‚Äù. Yea, for me I was in the heavy side compared to what I was in college but I had gotten myself down around 135-140, still slightly heavier than college but a healthy weight. 

My ex husband would always criticize what I ate. Even if it was healthy. He would tell me to just stop eating by if I wanted to lose weight and called it a ‚Äúdiet.‚Äù I would eat carrot and hummus and he said that it would make me fat and guilt me into stop eating it and then stop buying it altogether. If he saw I was eating something he would say ‚Äúbeing a little piggy, are we?‚Äù He would say this in a cutesy and playful tone, but it still hurt me considering every time we were angry and fighting, he would flat out call me fat. 

Before my 30th birthday (two days before I left him) I mentioned how I wanted a mug of ice cream, which mind you I never do because I just never had much of a sweet tooth to begin with, but I did this night. He then told me I shouldn‚Äôt if I want to look good on our trip to Cancun and that I‚Äôve gained weight. When I decided not to eat it because I was hurt (he didn‚Äôt say this in a nice way, hence why I was hurt) he said that I was being dramatic and made me feel worse. 

For the most part, I feel I‚Äôve recovered from the mental abuse he‚Äôs put me through but now I have a complicated relationship with food. I‚Äôm always mentally keeping track of what I eat and how much. Sometimes I keep healthy snacks at work to munch on every now and then. Sometimes when I do (just now, for the third time which is what prompted me to post this), I have that memory of him in my head calling me a ‚Äúlittle piggy‚Äù and how the one time I told him I was 130, he then said ‚Äúnow get to 125‚Äù without even hesitating. I then feel guilty for eating and basically eat nothing for the rest of the day. 

I left my ex husband in May of 2023. My new boyfriend who is a health nut and loves the gym has recognized this with me and tries to encourage me to eat because I need to and that what I‚Äôm eating is not at all unhealthy. He‚Äôs supportive but I cannot seem to shake the food guilt my ex husband has instilled in me. 

Does anyone have any advice? ",2025-03-06 15:45:52,2025-03-17 02:07:01,all_new_posts

-I got a job and steadily payed off the debt that my abuser put me in
-I bought a car! Talk about freedom!
-I finally blocked him on EVERYTHING
-I went to therapy and built a support system
-I slowly rebuilt the family and friendships my abuser had cut me off from. Some I couldn't get back, but most I did.
-I met my partner. I never knew men could be so kind, patient, and gentle. Even my therapist is amazed on our relationship. We are planting a vegetable garden together this weekend.

So at this point I'm open to almost anywhere.

Knowing that he will face time in prison hurts. This was the last thing I ever wanted to happen. I keep thinking if he just apologized. I wouldn‚Äôt have even cared if he hit me more. Sounds demented right? It‚Äôs funny because he was the one trying to hurt me. He called the cops on me because he thought they would believe his vile lies but instead he‚Äôs facing a felony charge for hurting me. I thought maybe in the future I would see him again and it would go back to normal but it‚Äôs too late. He always said if he goes to jail he will hate me forever. I‚Äôm not the one who put him in jail but those eyes of hatred he gave me still pierce my soul and haunt me. How can someone who did all these horrible things to me not even care? Feel no remorse? They asked me if I‚Äôd like him to have anger management but he did that before it didn‚Äôt work I still would get hit. I feel devastated, betrayed, and hopeless. I gave gave gave and he‚Äôs still gone. I could move on and not persue these charges but it just doesn‚Äôt feel like the right thing to do anymore. I want to disappear. Sometimes I feel like it‚Äôd be better if I was gone. I just want my life to be normal again. This dark cloud follows me everywhere. When will the sun come out again?

1j4ucgd,Domestic Violence / Baby is 8 weeks old,Necessary-Shower-573,11,2025-03-06 12:28:08+00:00,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j4ucgd/domestic_violence_baby_is_8_weeks_old/,"Hi there - I experienced DV by my husband last night. He has had a past of alcoholism and I caught him drunk and he terrorized me and our 8 week old baby. He smashed my computer when i tried to reach someone for help and hid my phone. He took our baby from me and was holding him in scary ways and wouldn't give him back to me. I called 911 and the police arrested him and are charging him with ""wrongs to a minor"" ""destruction of property"" and ""disturbance of the peace"". He was released from jail and his staying with his brother and the state has a protection probation on him so he can't have access to me or our baby until his case is over.

I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with something like this. This is the first time he scared me, and his behavior taking our baby and trying to scare me with him (he left him on the couch face down when i was trying to call 911 from the other room). I'm very scared being a single mom but I make good money and have one month left of maternity leave before I have to figure out childcare. My gut tells me to run for the hills but any and all advice navigating DV with such a young baby would be appreciated.

For reference I have tried to get him to be sober for years. I left him while I was pregnant and he went to a 30 day outpatient program but has been drinking in secret since I believe. ",2025-03-06 12:28:08,2025-03-17 02:07:06,all_new_posts

The relationship is over, but I say stbx because I'm trying to figure out a lawyer to get my marriage annulled. 

My son's injury is consistent with SBS. My stbx claimed he fell onto his steel toe boot but my son literally cries if he bops himself in the nose with his own hand. He never cried and I never heard a thud. I was calling 911 to get him help due to him breathing hard. 

I talked with a cop after filing a dvp (got denied because the clerk didn't want to help me with filling it out and didn't explain it to me) and he got it bumped to state level and talked with a prosecutor. I have a feeling that my stbx is going to jail soon as the entire city of Spencer police were looking for him and stalking the Ann Street apartments in Spencer too. 

I'm being harassed by his family to drop the charges or to not press charges because ""he can't help it. It was just one time."". 

About the only place in stuck in is trying to find a decent lawyer to annul my marriage that isn't going to cost an arm and a leg. If you can give me more advice on what else I need to do please comment. I just want my son back. ",2025-03-06 11:21:48,2025-03-17 02:07:07,all_new_posts

I just posted this in r/Advice, but I'm editing a bit to fit this sub, because I know I'm in a violent relationship.

I want to change my life situation.
I am a divorced 34/F mother of two teens. My ex is in jail because he was physically violent towards us, so my kids get no alimoney or anything of the sort. 
I have BPD and got manipulated into a new relationship too fast, and we live with my new partner now. We have lived here a couple of years, however, my partner is violent by being extremely controlling.
In my situation, I am barely able to leave the house on my own (which has resulted in me having no friends anymore), I am not allowed to wear skirts or dresses, I AM NOT ALLOWED TO SPEND TIME WITH MY CHILDREN (unless he specifically requests or allows it at a given moment), and he even has cameras inside the house all the time. He has to know everything we are doing, why, when and where, ALL THE TIME.

We have nowhere else to go, since I have no other family besides my kids and my mom, and they all live with me and depend on me. 

I do have a degree, but I never graduated, so I cannot work on that, and I cannot afford to graduate at the moment. My partner only ""let's"" me work from home or in odd small jobs that don't make him jealous or take too much of my time, since his excuse is that he pays for housing, groceries and all the basics. And I just got fired from the Home Office job that I had, and have been getting rejected from other similar jobs, so I'm getting desperate.

I have no savings because of some trouble with my ex and my ex lawyer that was handling my case against him (the lawyer turned against me and they joined forces to scam me). So I'm also in HUGE debt and need to pay that off, which means I am completely broke right now and have no way to invest in a business or something like that.

I know that there are refugees and houses for battered spouses, but, at least in my country, they are overcrowded places that are unsafe and unsanitary, and because of my degree I have been close to some horror stories about those places.

I also feel so old to begin a new life...

I don't know what to do to better our situation, but I know we deserve better. Do you have any advice or similar stories?
Thank you!",2025-03-06 01:36:30,2025-03-17 02:08:19,all_new_posts
1j4g2pb,Not sure what to do about younger sister,UsedExtension,3,2025-03-05 22:30:34+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j4g2pb/not_sure_what_to_do_about_younger_sister/,"I am 34 and my sister is 23. We don‚Äôt physically live in the same house, but it is my parents and I am on their property in my own place with my child and pets (since my ex and I split, I had no where to go). My sister is unstable and always has been the person you avoid. She has gotten physically violent with my step dad, other sister, mother, and now me. I have let her have a basic relationship with my daughter, who is 5, meaning she will make things for her or they will paint together, etc. I am always there. 

She has gotten on me before for really no reason and today wasn‚Äôt much different. I went to take a shower (I use theirs because my hot water heater is ridiculous and Idk how to fix it yet), but she was in the bathroom. I asked ‚Äúyou taking a shit?‚Äù (lol) and she told me that it was her house and she can shit wherever she wanted. I was like wow, ok, i just wanted to know how long you‚Äôd take lol and brushed it off. She kept going but I just ignored it and waited. I was running late for work so I immediately went into the bathroom, but my sister asked my daughter to paint. I said no because I‚Äôm in a hurry and maybe later. She argued with me. My kid ran away shouting for us to stop fighting over her. I went and got her, I wasn‚Äôt listening to what my sister was still going on about, then took her to the bathroom. My kid had a little fit while I showered but then eventually came and started giggling and playing with the water. My sister walked up to the door and told me my kid is going to hate me when she grows up. I just said huh but then ignored it.

Later, I got out and dressed and popped my head into her room and said I was tired of her saying things like that and I needed to go to work so I couldn‚Äôt let her play. She told me my behavior was disgusting and all I did was punish my kid for the fact that she was rude to me earlier. I was like, ok whatever. You can‚Äôt always get what you want and I actually told her that maybe if she said please, I would let her play really fast. She said she wasn‚Äôt going to argue in front of my kid. I told her it wasn‚Äôt an argument and I didn‚Äôt want her to talk to my kid anymore. She kept yelling it, I kept asking if she heard me. She slammed the door on me, but my foot had been in the doorway and it didn‚Äôt close. She grabbed a spray bottle and sprayed me directly in my eyes. I kneed her and pushed her away because I didn‚Äôt know what it was. (Keep in mind, I didn‚Äôt go in on her because she is nearly 6‚Äô and I am 5‚Äô2.) She called the police and stated she wanted to charge me with assault and call CPS. I told her she was a horrible person and I was tired of it (callback to the times she said I am a horrible mother and pet owner bc my rats got an upper respiratory infection and passed. Like, ok kid.) I called my girls grandma to pick her up bc I didn‚Äôt want her there for this.

I waited. Cops came. First two cops split, one with her and one with me, before a third showed up and stayed with me and the other cop. They were sympathetic and had actually looked it up and saw she had actually been barred from the property at one point, too. Cops traded places and the one she had first was not too kind but this isn‚Äôt the first time the cops have been called, so whatever. Told me that any time she has had the cops called on her in the past is irrelevant, and the fact that my foot was in her room nullified any complaint I had against her and made her in the right. My mom also told her that if she really did call the cops, then she wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to live there. Apparently, the simple threat is actually against the law and they are contacting my mother about that bc we need to officially evict her. My step dad was home and he corroborated my side, including that this is usually how a day goes normally, if not with me then someone else. 

I am a full adult, trying to protect my kid, and I am too old for this. She tried to use that against me, even though she is an adult too. I don‚Äôt know what my kids dad is going to do. We do not have a civil relationship, really, because he has only decided to be more involved within the last year or so. 

What have you done? What do I do? I know my mom can evict her, but would I be able to get an order for her to stay away if she does?  Considering this was her calling on me, does that mean an order isn‚Äôt even worth the effort? My step dad and mother spoke just last week about the option of getting her out of the house, but my mom is such a sucker for her because shes unwell. Like, I know she is, but she is also unsafe. My mom told her she felt abused by my sister and my sister flew off the handle. I‚Äôm at a complete loss. ",2025-03-05 22:30:34,2025-03-17 02:08:20,all_new_posts

So I put together an Excel spreadsheet of the incident dates, reported report number, etc. to prepare myself in case I do end up moving forward with a protection order. Anyway, the pattern that I saw was every two to three months, his behavior escalates resulting in a report filed with local law enforcement or other authoritative body. Seeing this pattern really brought home for me what has been happening and also helping me see that I am not the crazy one. That the moments of calm are timed out just enough so I let my guard down again. The last incident occurred last weekend, nearly 2 months, almost to the day of the last incident. I just wanted to share this for others who may find it useful. Once you start documenting in a logical way, you will likely see patterns emerge as well. Sending everyone a giant hug today.
