1jcsndx,Has resorted to using literal torture tactics like sleep deprivation,grandpagrandpa1,1,2025-03-16 18:52:02+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcsndx/has_resorted_to_using_literal_torture_tactics/,"It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I am able to figure out when he starts fighting just to fight with me, and I won‚Äôt engage. So now he‚Äôs resorted to punishing me by bringing my close familial relationships and other triggering info into the fights that is in no way relevant. I‚Äôm used to the regular slew of insults and garbage. Last night was absolutely insane and a step further into more crazily abusive territory.

He fought with me for TWELVE hours. He started with me at 9 PM, accusing me of being in a ‚Äúbad mood‚Äù when absolutely nothing was wrong. Fought with me until almost 3 AM. I desperately tried to disengage and end things. I fell asleep for 3 hours. He woke me up at 6 AM, and fought with me until 9:30 AM, forcing me to stay awake. He did all this so that he wouldn‚Äôt have to do something for me today that we had planned to do all week. I called him out at the beginning of the fight and said, ‚Äúare you picking a fight with me so you don‚Äôt have to [do this thing for me] tomorrow?‚Äù He easily proved me right.

I quickly debunked everything he was arguing about and finally lost my mind because he you can only be told you ain‚Äôt shit and deprived of sleep for so long. I called him out on his own bullshit and he couldn‚Äôt handle it, so he went back to his usual DARVO responses ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt love me üò§‚Äù ‚Äúyou hate me üò§‚Äù ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt give a shit about me üò§‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so ungrateful üò§.‚Äù And it‚Äôs so funny when I pull up conversations of me being the world‚Äôs greatest most loving attentive thankful girlfriend. 

I‚Äôm so fucking beyond exhausted, they are energy vampires and not allowing me to physically sleep was absolute insanity. I‚Äôm used to being abused and torn to shreds but I‚Äôm not used to literal physical torture. Especially because I take prescribed sleep/anxiety medication that makes it harder for me to stay awake, causing confusion and also rendering the medication useless because my adrenaline fights through it. Then I have to take more to achieve sleep/fight intense panic, putting me in a negative position with my doctor and pharmacy. "

I asked him if he wanted to go look at it while i do the chores and see if it was something we wanted to get the truck out for. The truck is parked behind some things so figured he can see if it‚Äôs worth digging the truck out. 

He said no and he wanted to go with me, so I said something along the lines of I don‚Äôt know what would be considered a good freezer and we can kill two birds with one stone while he looked at it and I did chores. He just said in an annoyed tone ‚Äúwell never mind we don‚Äôt need to get it‚Äù. I got annoyed because he always does this rolled my eyes and left the car without saying anything (likely closed the door a little hard but not slamming it) and started getting the groceries out of the trunk. 

He got out slammed his door and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre always such a bitch to me‚Äù and I again said I thought you can look at it and come back, if we want it we can get the truck out and go back together. 

He‚Äôs now giving the cold shoulder and I can‚Äôt stop crying. I really don‚Äôt think it was wrong to ask him to go look while I handle the other things, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking what my role is in this. "

However, I found out my ex and his gf just broke up through social media and I need someone to talk to about this. 

Last night I saw a few posts from his new gf saying my ex is kicking her out after she was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. Apparently he gave her three days to leave, turned off the electricity in their place so she would move out (paid for it to be shut off and then paid for it to be turned on after she left), stole some of her stuff, and tried to defame her to the people close to her. I'm not sure if any abuse took place before this, from the rest of her posts about their relationship she seemed happy. 

He threatened to kick me out multiple times and held my housing over my head almost daily, knowing I didn't have a safe place to go to. I feel really bad for her. I also feel like I could've done something to prevent this if I had just reached out and told her he's abusive.   "

I‚Äôm used to walk on egg shells at home - kids can‚Äôt be too noisy or messy, we have to do what husband says or he gets angry, and if the kids don‚Äôt show him affection (hugs, say hi, talk to him when HE wants it) then he gets angry, takes away rights (phone, tv, toys) or gives the silent treatment/ignore them.

1jcqowk,Bf wants me to be friends with his ex to sabotage her,Professional-Mood297,0,2025-03-16 17:28:02+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcqowk/bf_wants_me_to_be_friends_with_his_ex_to_sabotage/,"So I (20F) helped my bfs (23M) ex into rehab at the beginning of this year. And while I did it because I didn't want this girl to get trafficked (she came close to being trafficked), and I didn't want her dying... I don't want to be her friend. And important context, she is his parents' next door neighbor so you can see her car if you're over there. And he asked me to literally be friends with her and he wants me to fuck up her life from the inside. And I asked him how the hell I would even do that, and what he was on about. He told me that he wants me to convince her to get behind the wheel while really drunk. And that he hates seeing that car, and a big reason he was talking to her while we were on break was because he loved her car, and it's supposed to be his (even though her mom bought it for her) And it annoyed the hell outta me, because you mean you put me through all that stress not only for an ex, but for a CAR. He has a nice convertible already, I really don't get it??? 

This could all be an effed up joke, but it's wild to say in the first place. But I really don't know if he was being serious or not. 

Also this all started because she called him from a textnow number and started saying that he was holding the rehab thing over her head, and that triggered him. And that she thought him and his brother was following her, which he claims isn't true, they were just leaving at the same time. And I know he went to go play basketball with his friends so idk. "

1jcp1nz,Controlling behavior escalated to something physical,hiss_terical,1,2025-03-16 16:16:44+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcp1nz/controlling_behavior_escalated_to_something/,"My husband and I have been together for a long time. Things were worse in the beginning when we both were heavy drinkers, but we both quit and things got better. I used to have to lock him out of a bedroom because he would follow me around screaming at me. Recently, he's been pushing me to work more and I'm also going to school. I am busy a stupid number of hours a week...60+ between school and work. He wanted me to go back to school, but then started complaining because I'm not doing enough housework and not being intimate with him, both emotionally and physically. It feels like the goal posts are always changing and more and more and more is being demanded of me, no matter how much I'm already doing. I'm exhausted. Burnt out. 

We got into a fight and I left to cool down and pick up my meds from the pharmacy. I got a nasty ""where the fuck do you think you're going?"" text, and then he decided to leave to go out drinking. When finally came home hours later, he demanded to see my phone, accusing me of cheating on him because I left. He woke me up screaming at me, and then fought me for my phone, wrestling it away from me. The kids heard it all. I took the kids and left. I haven't been back. 

He's begging to reconcile, and some part of me wants to believe it was only the alcohol that caused  the violence, but even before that our relationship had many issues. I don't know if there's any way for this to get better. And I can't stomach the thought of living with him again, or normalizing this behavior for our children. Or putting in more work and effort when I'm already so exhausted. Everything he texts me about is pushing to meet up, talking about how hard this is on him, and I still feel like I'm getting no consideration. He's being extra nice, but it feels fake. I feel like he just wants me back in the house with the kids, and nothing else (my feelings, my trauma, my happiness, the kids' wellbeing) matters as long as he can return to normal.

I just don't know where to go from here. I mean, I know, but I'm having a hard time. I feel like I'm stuck in limbo. I guess I just wanted to make a post in a space where people would understand. Thanks for listening. "
1jcp076,Extreme guilt after a 12 hour standoff,Zestyclose-Skirt1583,2,2025-03-16 16:15:00+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcp076/extreme_guilt_after_a_12_hour_standoff/,"Tldr. Ex was sent back from work yesterday and I didn't realize how drunk he was before leaving, as he usually leaves when I come home from work. He came back from work after being sent home, and our car was messed up because he had ran over a mailbox. He came back crying and I immediately knew something was wrong.  

He had stopped for another beer and had it cracked open. He was crying and freaking out and I tried to calm him down and get him inside to drink water and sleep it off. But he immediately turned angry when he got out of the car and his screaming alerted a neighbor. Well, the neighbor watched and waited to intervene until she saw him swing on me. He hit me twice and I feel like I egged him on because I told him to back up and not do it because his probation would be screwed. He was on probation for strangulation and assault where we cut off complete communication until he was solidly in therapy and attending classes. 

Well, he fled. It was dark and we live out in a very rural area. The state police searched for an hour with two people before leaving. 

He came inside and a camera caught him so the police were called again. A very unprofessional officer told me I could be charged with aiding and abetting (? Correct spelling) if I didn't call and he showed up. I proceeded to explain I didn't know what kind of mood he was in and I wouldn't be able to call them if he simply shows up and dude rolled his eyes. The second time, they showed up with four-five state police officers, only one was a woman. They left after two hours.

The third time they showed up,  he fled somewhere new. I wanted this to be over because it was around four in the morning and I didn't want our little one to wake up (she's 3). I communicated with police that I would throw a blanket and hoodie outside for him and where he would be and they didn't catch him then. The same officer that threatened me with a charge on the last visit then demanded that I quit playing games and tell them where he went. Again, I didn't know. I had an inkling of an idea, but they were searching the few streets around here and not the woods like I'd said. 

The last final time he was caught inside, hiding in a crawlspace in our house. He came back to say goodbye to our daughter and apologized for his actions even though  üíØ know he would do it again. 

The same officer was there and I can't remember the last stupid comment he made, but I finally threatened to file a complaint. It took them 45 minutes to get here from one town over (a 20 minute drive). He apparently was the Sargeant. 

I just feel insanely guilty and depressed. I was on the phone with him for 6 hours that night, and he wouldn't tell me where he was, but I wanted to listen to see if or when he'd be caught and he wanted to talk about things we had repressed during prior arguments. He hasn't called from jail yet, and I feel like I'm going through the motions but not really here. I'm taking care of my daughter but not myself, and now have to worry about daycare and a new vehicle... And I feel horrible and I miss him and I know I shouldn't.  I just keep remembering how awful it felt to be on the phone with him, just waiting like that and our last hug and I know he wouldn't be violent towards our kid ever, but now I'm fucked up inside because he'll be in there 4 years if not longer with new charges.

1jcogvv,Am I being abused,None,1,2025-03-16 15:51:28+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcogvv/am_i_being_abused/,"I didn‚Äôt know what to title this post because it‚Äôs a lot and I will probably end up deleting..

My fiance (27M) and I (25F) have been together for about 7 years, since our late teens. In that time, we have had some very crazy insane arguments. Currently now in our mid to late 20s, nothing is really wrong. But fianc√© cannot stop bringing up the past to rehash and yell and belittle me over.

For the first few years of our relationship, I was very bad at communicating. I invalidated, and I name called, I escalated arguments, I did it all. He spent years calling it out to me and ‚Äúbeating it‚Äù into my brain so that I would stop these behaviors. And for the most part (aside from the random attitude or eye roll) I have stopped. And I‚Äôm thankful that he was consistent with me and helped me change , and I tell him this. He also uses this against me quite often currently, to make me feel exactly how you would think. Another situation that gets brought up often is when (3? Years ago I think) I texted a male coworker to play a video game together: flirting. Nothing more happened but that did betray his trust. When caught, I started an argument and name called. I admit to this every time he brings it up and apologize. He also was texting someone (6 Years ago) and had a plan to go over to their house for sex, but I‚Äôm not allowed to ‚Äúuse that against him‚Äù because when I caught him, he admitted it immediately and apologized. There‚Äôs a whole lot more that I can‚Äôt add in or this would be way too long. Things like him organizing and me having trouble keeping it clean (I‚Äôm the only one working) - this an excuse to yell at me. Me not being psychically affectionate enough (I‚Äôve validated and I‚Äôm working on it). He says that he‚Äôs the reason our daughter is so considerate and the way she is and if left to me, she would be- fill in the blank with anything bad. If I even come inside the house and he perceives I have an attitude and I don‚Äôt get rid of it- argument. He has anger issues and punches things, yells at me, gets in my face, calls me names, these outbursts lasts for hours. While this is happening, I‚Äôm usually bawling my eyes out, listening, apologizing, telling him all the ways I will make up for it and make his life amazing. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. Last night he admitted he‚Äôs been having dreams of punching or choking me out and he can feel that it‚Äôs my fault. I‚Äôm nervous to even post this because what if he sees. And like I said, nothing new is happening because I‚Äôm a better partner now, but he has trauma. And I don‚Äôt know how to help I‚Äôm through it. He says if I just put a lens on where I enrich his life and he‚Äôs always at the front of my brain , maybe that will help. Honestly I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm even posting this, I just feel so helpless and hopeless right now. Does anyone have advice?"
1jcntmi,I left last night with my baby,CampApprehensive2213,28,2025-03-16 15:22:28+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcntmi/i_left_last_night_with_my_baby/,"I posted a while ago. Things were great again until they weren‚Äôt. 

He was wonderful for the rest of my pregnancy. Wonderful with our son.  I have so many photos of them together that now hurt to look at. 

The last two weeks have been horrendous. I actually thought his cruelty was caused by alcohol‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs been sober for about nine months. Having a baby was extremely motivating to stay on the straight and narrow. But time passed, he got stressed, and he got so unkind. 

He was yelling and screaming at me all day yesterday in front of our baby.  I‚Äôve never felt so defeated. He bought alcohol for the first time in the evening and I only figured it out about an hour after he got home and screamed some more. 

I recorded it all and I finally tore the bandaid off and sent one of the videos to a friend who convinced me to leave. 

Last time he bent my hand back and hurt me. I was pregnant. This time I didn‚Äôt stick around long enough for him to touch me. 

I feel so so bad for taking my baby away from his father. He loves his baby. 

The whole thing was humiliating. I was in a hotel lobby crying with a screaming baby going through all my bags looking for my credit card. My phone was blowing up and I was trying not to look. 

Then we get to our room and baby is inconsolable for about twenty minutes. I‚Äôm crying. I‚Äôm FaceTiming a friend whos also crying. Now this morning I can hear all the noises in the hotel and I know how thin the walls are and I‚Äôm just so mortified. 

I know it‚Äôs for the best but it feels so bad. I‚Äôm so scared he‚Äôs going to hurt himself. 

This is all his fault and he ruined everything with his actions but I feel like I‚Äôm the one who ripped our family apart and I can‚Äôt ever go back"

Our fights often includes him threatening to leave (I play into it and always end up stopping him- and when I admitted in a couples therapy session that sometimes I'm so tired that I think about letting him go, and he got mad and brought that up at a later fight (like bro- wtf)), but recently in lieu of that, he shouted he no longer wanted to do couples counseling and told me to cancel the appointment. Our relationship was always a bit rocky due to family issues but it seemed to really get bad in the past year or two.

Currently, we are almost a week in on him giving me the silent treatment, which is not super unusual when he gets mad but will often put it aside for household comments (bills, groceries, etc.). But the other day I mentioned something about groceries and he snapped at me, 'don't talk to me, text me if you need to.' The silent treatment escalated to straight up hostilely ignoring me, and this AM I told him morning, and asked how he was feeling, and he snapped again about texting him and not talking to him. I hear him talking to the cat and he's normal and sweet. He just texted me that this is how it's gonna be until further notice and to communicate only through text and that if I can't respect this boundary to let him know.

I know my normal meter is fucked up because of my own trauma and family issues (which is something I'm fixing with therapy, but my SO is impeding it a bit because I need to talk about us) but yeah... In all ways I feel like I've been set up to fail, feel no support and so weak, and I'm so sad."

How do you handle the awkwardness? The constant effort to set and maintain boundaries? The desire to print out self help pages and make them see the light? The instinct to reason and logic this person into new behavior? The disappointment that they face such relatable problems and yet can't seem to resolve them reasonably?

Yesterday, I had a rare day off and ended up at his party later. I went inside to use the restroom and eat and started chatting with two guys across the counter from me and asked how they knew him.

After I left, I got a text from him saying ‚Äúgreat seeing you. Let me know when you get home!‚Äù My mind was blown. Then, HE blocked ME on everything.

I told them to delete them and report it, but I had to explain to multiple friends what was going on, it‚Äôs stupid for him to get to me through my friends, they shouldn't have to worry about that and quite frankly I never wanted to discuss this with anyone again but since it's out there, I could really use some advice. I'd rather just forget it, but now I can't because he's making it everyone's business and messing up my social life. 

This is why I never post on social media and make my life very private. It took me hours to explain what was going on and it was humiliating, he forced my hand yet again and I'm still playing his games. I can barely do anything about it. I'm out of my mind. I don't know what to do. This has happened multiple times, but this time he is going after my friends. 

He has it set to a picture he took from me as well. I let my guard down and this happens. I'm at my wits end. I can't do it anymore. 

It's worth mentioning, on February 19, he harassed me and pretended to be someone else, I told him I couldn't do this and left him hanging. Then he made an account (different from this one) to send a long apology saying he never wanted to force me to engage with him, that he loves me, that I deserve better, and that I should block him after reading it. I ignored it. But instead of respecting his own words, he came right back to contact me again. That's the level of ""respect"" he has for me.

Thank you Reddit. Appreciate it in advance."
1jcka3t,I just need to vent‚Ä¶,Fit-Luck69,4,2025-03-16 12:23:18+00:00,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcka3t/i_just_need_to_vent/,"TW - Emotional abuse, drug addiction, gaslighting


Hi, 

Im sorry if this comes off as poorly written, I am emotional. didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge what I may be going through and I didn‚Äôt want to post here because it solidifies what my fear is. 

I think I am being abused. I suffered from abuse my childhood, my school life and in a few relationships as well. 

I thought I escaped it all. I told myself after my second last ex I‚Äôd never be abused again. What has happened now? I am with someone (who mind you, doesn‚Äôt even want to make it official yet) who just treats me like absolute fucking shit 90% of the time. 

I spoke to him for months and now have moved to another state to be with him. We spend basically everyday together for the last 4 months. 

He is just so disrespectful. He constantly critiques everything I do, constantly puts me down, blurts out completely rude insults/word vomit, lashes out on me, blames me for everything wrong, gaslights me when I tell him I‚Äôm upset and downplays it - then blames me, barely apologises, refuses to have any emotional conversations with me - I try to set boundaries and I‚Äôm a ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù or he stonewalls me, he doesn‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm sad, he constantly is being defiant towards me and the list just go on and on‚Ä¶

He is a drug addict to one of the hardest drugs. I consistently blame the addiction on the way he treats me. I justify it to myself his actions because of his adhd, autism and addiction. He downplays me so much and says he‚Äôs ‚Äújust joking‚Äù when he hurts me and that I‚Äôm too sensitive. I‚Äôm constantly apologising for lashing out back. When I speak politely asking not to treat me like that, it doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve started lashing out a lot because he won‚Äôt listen when I try to communicate kindly and maturely. 

He takes advantage of my kindness. I do everything for him. I have a full time job and he doesn‚Äôt work. I clean, I make him food or buy him food, I drive to places to get him stuff without him in the car. 

The guy doesn‚Äôt even like hugging or kissing me, he spends days awake playing games while I‚Äôm alone in bed. Not to mention he‚Äôs never touched me sexually - only me giving to him. He has a reason for this and I respect it. But still‚Ä¶ sucks feeling so rejected often. He also doesn‚Äôt compliment me, never has called me pretty or beautiful. Closes is when I ask him if I look pretty or good and he says ‚Äúyeah‚Äù very bluntly. 

The thing is, I‚Äôve seen his good side when he was sober. He never love bombed me. When he‚Äôs sober he genuinely is so much better. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just the drugs or him in general. 

Why the fk do I allow myself to be treated like this? I‚Äôm too much of a coward to leave and be by myself. I‚Äôm constantly trying to improve myself mentally through therapy, groups, reading up, working on myself. 

I also sacrificed so much for him. I moved far away for him, I had cosmetic work done on myself to impress him (he never asked btw I just wanted to be perfect for him) I try so hard. 

I honestly feel so pathetic for staying. I feel pathetic that I can‚Äôt see a way out and I just hold on to hope that when he‚Äôs sober he‚Äôs better. I genuinely feel like I have no respect for myself and I feel so damn alone. I don‚Äôt tell anybody because it‚Äôs embarassing. I don‚Äôt want to tell people because it means it‚Äôs true. If he just showed that sensitive side he showed before when he was sober it would be all I need. I don‚Äôt ask for material items, I don‚Äôt ask for much honestly. He acts like showing me affection is an inconvenience. 

I just don‚Äôt understand how somebody can treat someone else like this. I feel like a shell of a person,  I just want to be loved. If I leave him I have nothing left. I‚Äôm stuck in this state until my lease ends at least and that‚Äôs not for awhile. I‚Äôd have nobody. I don‚Äôt want to leave him because I do love him so deeply. But I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm being mistreated. 

And it‚Äôs crazy because I am so educated on abuse, and yet I make excuses. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm turning a blind eye on it because of hope. 

I think I hold on too because he doesn‚Äôt show other typical sings. Like love bombing, jealousy or controlling behaviour. 

I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on anybody. I pray everyday that things will improve and I know my situation is nothing compared to others and I look like a fkn fool for staying. I know I‚Äôll get shat on because it is my fault honestly. I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a victim or ‚Äúpity me‚Äù but I‚Äôm being completely raw and transparent right now.  

I don‚Äôt know what the point of posting is since I don‚Äôt want to be told to leave him. I would like some success stories with people improving but we wouldn‚Äôt be on this subreddit if that was the case, plus I don‚Äôt want other people to get false hope in abusive situations either because that‚Äôs harmful. 

I have so much compassion and love for everybody else but myself. I am trying so hard to love myself and I just can‚Äôt. Never in my life. No matter what I‚Äôve done. 

I hope there‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel. I just want to be loved unconditionally with the same energy I give to them. I feel not good enough and like a waste of space. I sabotaged my life by moving here and staying with him after I saw the red flags. I knew and know better. "
1jck1hn,Trying to figure out if I'm in an abusive relationship.,crystalH0908,3,2025-03-16 12:08:49+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jck1hn/trying_to_figure_out_if_im_in_an_abusive/,"Ever since I first started dating my partner I feel like I've been slowly trying to be controlled and made to change. In the very beginning of the relationship my partner tried and succeeded to fast track the relationship. Which went against everything I believed in because of how my 14yr marriage with children ended. I always take things slow, I like to be friends first with a person I date first. I'm very old school in this department and have dated few men in my life, so far, and a couple of people for months and I never even became intimate with them(in any way) because it just never felt right or happened. My partner wanted me to give over all of my emotions and to act as if we had been dating for months, even though it had only been 2-3 weeks into the relationship and when I didn't that's when he began to tell me that there was something wrong with me. That I was emotionless, had no feelings. I was like a robot for being wary and wanting to taking things slow and get to know him better before I just gave over my heart and all the benefits and actions/behaviors that go with that. He told me that I should be texting him like every hour or so, with stuff like ""I'm thinking of you,"" or ""I miss you,"" and when I didn't or argued that what he was asking was a bit much and didn't seem reasonable. He would once again proceed to tell me that I'm the one who wasn't thinking correctly if I didn't agree with him and that something was wrong with me for not thinking like him. He would have expectations of me and want certain courtesies and behaviors from me that he, himself, wouldn't do, or think he shouldn't be required to have the same expectations or behaviors and this theme has continued through the entirety of our relationship, so far. Whenever we argued it was always me who's wrong and if he was ever wrong it could never be just his fault. It would also have to be partly my fault or I made him react the way he does. He constantly tells me I'm lying, when he has no proof I have been. He will tell me that I'm lying about things I'm thinking and feeling when there's no way he can even prove such things and will insist he's right even when I tell him what he's saying is incorrect. He constantly finds things about me to be upset with or to find fault with, even when everything is going fine, especially when everything is fine. Goes into my phone behind my back. Not that I care I have nothing to hide but will get worked up and anxious if I mention going into his phone like he has mine and will say only if he's there right next to me and can dictate what I can look at. He has put his hands on me 3 times. He's never punched or slapped me but the first time he forced me to kiss him, after an argument when he was leaving and I didn't want to and I was pulling my head away from him and out of his hands. Then he grabbed my head and forced me to look up while he forcefully kissed me and even hurt my mouth with how hard he did it. The 2nd time was in the car, and I told him to drop me at my place and that he wasn't to come in because we were arguing. When we got to my place and I tried to get out he gripped my jacket with both hands to point it was cutting into my arm and wouldn't allow me to get out of the car. I repeatedly tried to get out of his grip and out of the car for about 10 minutes before I slumped over and started crying because I realized I was helpless to do anything. Which reminded me of my very violent first marriage. My ex-husband put me in the hospital, raped me, and almost took my life and my partner knows this. So when he did what he did in the car it took me back to that horrible time in my life and I felt ashamed for feeling like I was back in the same situation. He finally let me out of the car and then proceeded to taunt me about not seeing any tears even though there's no way he could because I put my sunglasses on because mascara was all over, under my eyes, from crying so hard. Once I got to my apartment door I tried to shut the door on him but he slammed his foot in the doorway and I ended up just letting him in because I didn't want to make a scene with my neighbors right there. The 3rd time we were in bed and he hit me in the back with his vape because he thought I fell asleep smoking a cigarette in bed, which I hadn't. My back was to him and he couldn't see my face. When I addressed these situations with him, after they happened. He would tell me I was lying about how I felt and what I was thinking when he did what he did. Would say I was over exaggerating what occurred and that I was lying about him physically hurting me. To this day he sees nothing wrong with what he did in those situations. Even though he knows what happened to me in my past. I'm going to stop here for now. There is more stuff but he'll be getting up soon. Some feedback would be great because as he sees it and keeps telling me it's me that's the entire problem in the relationship. He's been relentless about calling me a narcissist, insisting that I am one that needs therapy, and that he read about the signs of a narcissist and that I have them. He even admitted joining a Reddit thread about narcissistic partners/spouses and when I asked what my signs were the only thing he's ever told me is that I get quite when we argue and I stop talking or I just refuse to interact. I've told him that is I coping mechanism I developed from the relationship with my physical/mentally abusive ex-husband because the more I tried to fight back, explain myself, stand up for myself. The worse the beatings were and he knows this. Again any insight would be helpful and thanks in advance."

However all night and this morning all I want is him. I miss when he was loving and caring the few times and I want to see him and try and fix this but I know it's bad and shouldn't happen. I just don't know what to do to stop myself from going back to him. I feel like I still love him but if I go back I doubt anything will change and I can't go through all of that again. I just need help and advice to stay away from going back.
1jcixz5,"I left... I should be happy, why does it hurt so bad?",aervin98,3,2025-03-16 10:55:41+00:00,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcixz5/i_left_i_should_be_happy_why_does_it_hurt_so_bad/,"TL;DR - basically, the title. 

It is 5:37am and I have what's left of my basic necessities (plus a few of my ""wants"") in the car with me. I say ""the rest of"" because I had moved out over 2 weeks ago after I was called a ""lazy PoS"" for the last time... my aunt and uncle offered me a place to stay for a few months and I've been staying there. I am in a parking lot now because I don't want to disturb my aunt and uncle so early, and I was staying at her house after a show just to have a place to sleep. I was on the couch, and it erupted into a fight more than once.. it escalated so quickly... so I left, except for a few occasions, for good... 

I do feel a sense of relief.. i keep to myself in my new home. I enjoy the peace and quiet. My aunt and uncle bicker, but it doesnt bother me. It's not my issue, and it's so nice to be in a place where everything isn't my fault and I'm punished for it. 

However... this is the most heartache and pain I have ever felt.. I cannot provide my dog a good home so she's keeping her. I can see her whenever, but that means going back, and that hurts in multiple areas. When i travel, i will tske my dog to my gigs, but then i have to take her back until I can get my own place... I've gone back several times to help wjere I felt responsible, and every time what started as help turned into an expectation and then the cycle started again and I would leave again and ust reopen all the wounds that can't hea - due to my inablility to cut contact completely because I feel compelled, to a fault, to do the right thing... it is a blessing and a curse..

This hurts so much.. Overall, I am okay. Not wanting to ""end it"" at all, so to speak. Haven't even thought of it. No harm has been done to myself (which used to be an issue). In this sense, I am extremely proud of how strong I have been, but there is deep, deep presence of pain and hopelessness... When I invisioned leaving, pain was never in the equation, but it seems to be a majority of what I'm feeling. I don't understand..

Why does something that is ultimately *extremely* positive for myself so painful... "

I have a pattern of falling for the wrong guy, trying to fix people, and prioritizing others over myself. Recognizing this was one thing, but breaking out of the cycle was another. A year ago, I was too broke to get therapy, so I started reading self-help books and made a list of the qualities and values my future partner must have. I took time for myself and reflected on my own unhealthy patterns. I really want children someday, but I don‚Äôt want to raise them alone.  

In September, I slowly started dating again. But this time, I thought more about who my future children would have to call their father rather than what I found exciting. In December, I met a guy I wouldn‚Äôt normally go for, someone I initially thought was boring. But he matched my list perfectly. I kept seeing him, and he turned out to be the kindest man I have ever dated. After two months, I started to develop real feelings for him.  

I promise it‚Äôs worth it. I feel so safe with him, but I am also my own person. I don‚Äôt have to carefully choose my words, we just talk.  

Please give the ""boring"" guy a chance. He feels boring because he doesn‚Äôt stress you out."

I (36f) have been dating my boyfriend (35m) for about a year. We live together. 
The whole month of February I‚Äôve been feeling like I have the worst PMS, kept feeling like my period was going to start.

My boyfriend went on a two week work trip across the country. The day he left, I started my period but the cramps and bleeding were so much worse than normal. I felt suicidal. I told him I had to end things with him because I was afraid he was drinking again on his trip (he is about 7.5 months sober) and that I was going to the hospital because of my suicidal ideation. He didn‚Äôt respond to my messages.

At the emergency room, the doctor told me I had tested positive for pregnancy and was having a chemical pregnancy miscarriage. They gave me an ultrasound to make sure it wasn‚Äôt ectopic and then sent me home. I am devastated. 

I had a stillbirth with my exhusband over a decade ago and this brought up all the pain from that. I had mostly given up on being a mother because of the scarring and fluid in my fallopian tubes, so getting pregnant this was unexpected. One of my early signs of pregnancy is suicidal thoughts and mood swings; this happened during my first pregnancy as well.

I messaged him when I got home from the hospital apologizing for my hormonal mood swing/suicidal thoughts and for being paranoid that he was drinking. I asked him to please call me. He didn‚Äôt respond. I called him and he didn‚Äôt respond. I poured my heart out over texts about what happened and asked him to please call me. I called his voicemail and cried, begging him to talk to me. It has been five days and he has completely ghosted me. I understand if he needs time to process what happened, but I wish he would have communicated that to me instead of ghosting me. 

I‚Äôm not only losing the pregnancy, but losing him. Just a few weeks ago he held me in his arms and told me he wanted to start a family with me.
He gets back from his work trip on the 22nd. I was supposed to pick him up from the airport, but I guess I won‚Äôt be now. 

All his belongings are in my home, including important ones like his car, the title to the house he is renovating, his desktop computer‚Ä¶ I wonder if he will come gather his possessions himself or continue to be a coward and send his parents.

I feel devastated. I thought he loved me and I believed all his promises for our future. I know he is ghosting me and not hurt in an accident or something because he is still active on social media. The pregnancy hormones are fading and I‚Äôm feeling more like myself. I will go all day keeping my mind off of the miscarriage then feel like I can barely breathe when a wave of grief hits me. 
It is hardest at bedtime. I have never felt this alone. 

My last message to him was: You wanna know what hurts more than losing a pregnancy? Being abandoned by the man I loved while I went through it.

This is one of the cruelest things anyone has ever done to me. There were times were I would see a mean side to him and I always worried that he was love bombing me or using me. I should have listened to my gut because he flipped his love off so quickly, I doubt he ever loved me at all. I keep wondering what I did wrong to make him abandon me when I lost his child. How can he hate me so much to be silent when I need him most? His mask has finally come off and I see that he is cold and cruel.

I must add that I was never overweight before I got into the relationship. I was really skinny. "

I am worried.",Usual-Ad-9740,24,2025-03-16 02:16:46+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcbczy/he_almost_killed_her_last_mothers_day_today_shes/,"Last year in May my co worker, and also friend was strangled by her baby daddy. She told me they got into an argument because he liked some girls picture on instagram, and they started to argue. So he choked her out while their 2 kids were sleeping, left her unconscious in their apartment, stole her car, and left her for dead. She told me the only time he doesn‚Äôt put his hands on her is when she‚Äôs pregnant. üòï 

I actually didn‚Äôt know this was a normal thing for her then I remembered actually seeing her with a busted lip before but she blamed it on her toddler son. There was another incident when he showed up to our job, and was looking for her and she was hiding from him. Anyways, after he almost killed her on Mother‚Äôs Day I told her to leave him because he could‚Äôve killed her, and left their kids without a mother. Honestly, I believe he was trying to kill her. He didn‚Äôt stop until she lost consciousness that sounds exactly like attempted murder to me. Eventually he won her back by I guess love bombing her, and buying her stuff to get her back. It‚Äôs literally a cycle. Im still very concerned for her well being because she‚Äôs having another baby by this abuser, and I fear he will continue to abuse her. I truly believe he only continues to get her pregnant to keep her stuck, and unable to leave. She has told me before she would struggle really bad without him. I am worried one day he will kill her, and leave their kids without a mother. I tried to give her solutions. I even told her we could go in on an apartment together because she deserves so much better. But I know trying to get her to leave will only result in me getting cut off as a friend and I do genuinely care about her. My old best friend is in a similar situation and cut me off because I tried to get her to leave her abuser. 


Anyways, just wanted to vent about the situation close to me. I hope her, and the babies are safe everyday. They don‚Äôt deserve to be without a mother, and I‚Äôm worried about what they‚Äôre exposed to with a man like this around. If that man strangles you, and hits you he will kill you. Nobody can ever convince me otherwise. "

It's almost 3 years since, we have married. He started threatening me right before our wedding (because of my cold feet).. and right from our wedding night I, was just his possession.. His parents come first, his siblings next, his business, then us (according to him). He literally fake cried during my delivery and was tormenting me for giving birth to our daughter.. Hiding that he gets cold sores and passing it to me when, I was a new mom (still gaslighting even though, he admitted it to derm).. Now, I suffer from frequent Hsv1 and OCD..


 we live extremely near his parents and would complain about me to them.. They also enjoy hearing about my faults (Both FIL and MIL).. This family hasn't treated even one of us (including my co-sister and co-brother) nicely.. They shame us publicly and privately.. My husband has slapped me multiple times infront of our toddler and has abused me both privately and publicly.. He is extremely nice to my family even, has helped my father with his business and provided financial aid. Which my family has repaid half the amount.. FIL even had the audacity to re-hire an employee who, my father has fired.. Even if I wanted a divorce, my family has no support to offer.  I'm shit scared of him.. I don't know whether to expect his good or bad side.. he is extremely loving to his nephews and nieces but, only rarely graces his loving side to my daughter.. I can't ask anything,  speak, or go to work.. He even accused me of talking my lover infront, of his relatives (I was sending a birthday wish to a female friend which,  I told him while typing the message).. My daughter loves him and his family though.. Maybe when she grows up.. I want a happy marriage.. He won't come for counseling/ normal talk with me.. I often see him, providing interest free loan to his company's staff. So, that they won't leave him.. he rarely provides for us and my father supports us (be it medicine,  milk. Groceries, etc).. 


I also feel sorry for him. He is hardworking and doesn't come from a good household.. His father nearly killed him while, dunking him in water when he was about 8 months for more than 5 times (just for irritating him). I dread waking up next day in this household.

Today after I saw him flirting with random girls at the store we went to, I was feeling a bit irritated. We go to a local market for groceries and someone asked if we were married. I said that we weren‚Äôt, and they proceeded to ask if we were engaged. Sometimes since I‚Äôm shy, I get a little bit uncomfortable and don‚Äôt know how to answer, since technically we are not engaged since I was never given a ring. I guess I was a bit brash and said ‚Äúmentally we are.‚Äù Which I know was kind of mean maybe, but what I meant was that we aren‚Äôt formally engaged. In front of everyone, he told me to go f*** myself. I really didn‚Äôt want to drive home with him (he has full control of my car), because I knew that he was going to drive recklessly. It was worse than I expected. I was sure we would get pulled over- scratch that I was PRAYING we would, because it was so scary. He then said, ‚Äúf*** you, I will marry a b***h on the corner.‚Äù He had said things like this before, and I often feel like saying, ‚Äòokay, if that is what you want then do that.‚Äô 
We sharply cut down a tiny alley going 65 miles an hour. As we flew out onto a street my brand new tire blew out. Of course he blamed it on me and said it was my fault and this is what happens when you are disrespectful. I didn‚Äôt say anything, I‚Äôm surprised we didn‚Äôt get killed, so maybe I should thank my lucky stars that was all that happened. 
How should I approach this? I know what I said was a bit rude, but what he said was honestly worse imo."

At one point I started to cry and he tried to keep going but it took me actually crying a bit for him to stop. He also would just force it in and used his hand to open my mouth. I tried having a discussion with him about it today and he says it was ""CNC"" but there was no discussion about it beforehand (we've talked about ""no limits"" days but that was months ago, we had no agreement to do it last night), no discussion of safewords, and he didnt do aftercare. I have a lot of evidence against him including him saying ""you kept going"" after i told him it wasnt consensual when I was saying no/stop/i dont want to, and then I said because he was forcing it and he said ""thats what facefucking is"". I also have the condom and havent showered yet so I could get a rape kit done, but I feel conflicted about it. He also made me puke on it when I said I didn't want to. This isn't the first time he has done this with me/crossed my boundaries/not respected the word ""no"". But last night was bad. 

I'm just conflicted about whether I am overreacting or not and should press charges. He is my FWB and we aren't exclusive. He treats me like shit. But I don't want to hurt him how he hurt me? Part of me still likes him and wants to see him again? It's so confusing. But I'm hurt and dissociated and sad after last night. After I told him I didn't feel good about last night and it wasn't consensual he said I should come over to his tonight so he can use all my holes. 

Any advice appreciated. "

She constantly stressed me saying ""your dad is going to cheat one me"" like ALL the time. ""You promise you will let me have full custody? Tell them that in court! Imagine some other woman trying to raise you as their son!"" My dad was never able to go to beach on holidays when we went, even with his own side of the family... bc ""he will look at naked girls"" aka girls in swimsuits, bc... it's THE FUCKING BEACH). 

My dad's parents were my saving grace, every weekend and most weeks I didn't have school I stayed with them (just 15 min away) and I didn't have to hear arguing and throwing stuff all the time. Well when I was 10/11 they bought me a small four wheeler (and helmet!) And my mom FLIPPED THE FUCK OUT, would no longer let me go over there and cussed them out. She would leave voicemails to them saying they are evil people. She would always tell me it's just me and her and that my dad would eventually leave. The stress was so bad I had a few Grey hair by 12 years old, at one point for a year or two thought I had chrons disease bc her cousin has it and my stomach was ALWAYS torn up. First day of kindegarden I shit myself and cried for my mommy. She even wiped me until I was like 7/8/9.

When I was in 4th grade I wrote a note to this girl's friend that I liked her friend and told her she was ""hot"". After a response it ended back up in my bag and my mom found it. She raised hell told me I'm a nasty slut for liking girls so young, (I was  a 10/11 year old boy) and that I was not allowed to look at, talk to , or especially not date ANYONE until I was 16, preferably 17. 

I wasn't allowed to have social media but downloaded it and hid it at night lol.  She never would go out with me and my dad but maybe once a year, bc she had to put on 4/5 hours worth of makeup (expensive) makeup. (She paid bills with my dad's money and we almost lost the house bc she was using the money on her make up, even tho she didn't go anywhere except the store and doctor to get her oxycontin (since I was 5 her hysterectomy ""went wrong"" and she needed 100smg of oxy a day plus zoloft and lorazepam)

She would take them all and go doctor hopping so my dad would put them in his car to take to work so she would only have what she needed that day. Well even at 11/12 I was ""too young"" to stay home by myself! So she would take me with her to break into his car (smash window/etc) to get it. Shit triggered a panic disorder in me.

This was around 13, she started going out with her extended family more. Turns out, she started cheating with her cousin, and left my dad. Never even had a custody thing bc she had no money for a lawyer and I didn't want to stay with a cheating, jobless, psychotic whore anyway. 

My dad finally started giving me freedom I never had, he would go out on weekend my my grandma would watch me or I'd be home alone. Around this time I got into weed. The bullying at school was easier when I had a good smoke to come home and look forward to.

Well by the time I'm 14 he starts dating this ugly,  2 pack a day cigarette christian-fascist woman with 2 kids. Within 6 months she burned her house down and moved in with us. She started setting new rules my dad didn't have, like I can't close my door with my gf in there (my dad didn't care as long as I used protection) but he said I needed to listen to her. She said I would burn in hell forever if I had sex before marriage. I also walked into MY OWN HOUSE to her and my dad fucking as loud as possible in MY room with door open, they had been dating less than a year and weren't married.

At this point (15) I spent summer with my grandparents who let me and my gf close the door lol. Same way they used to do for my dad. ""Yall gonna do it regardless we just want ya to be safe""  around school time they bought a new house 5min away from my grandparents and wanted me there so ""we can be a family"" I said no take it to court (I was 16 now). And never turned back.

I developed BPD which led to opiate addiction, the girl I dated at 15 that my stepmom told me I couldn't have sex with lasted until 21, we had a house together at 17. It failed bc I had serious trust issues and even tried therapy at 16, but my grandma, bless her heart (she doesn't force religion on me) got me a Christian ""psychiatrist"" (religious idiots should not be allowed in medicine) that I just agreed with everything he said and he said ""he seems perfectly fine with me!"" And I never went back or got help. Eventually got into Gma pain pills and when kratom saved me from that at 17/18, my gf and I lived at my grandpa's old house below them.

After a few years down there, one of my best friends from kindergarten all thru high-school hangout for first time in years bc people said I was weird for only hanging out with my girlfriend (she was my bff 100%) so we hangout and decides to do some coke like we did in high-school. I did it and he said ""there's some heroin in it to ;) I ended up addict3d, destroyed my life, my gf got hooked, we broke up, I went to methadone clinic to get help and try to get right so we could get back together and methadone clinic gave me 200mg but you have to take it THERE, they don't give you take homes here. So I blacked out bc they gave me twice what I needed. 

Well, I killed someone and got 25 years in prison, suspended thankfully due to the fact IT WASNT MY FAULT I TRUSTED THE DOCTOR. And now here I am back at grandparents, who are Grey now and GPA prob has alzheimers:( with no friends, no girlfriend/bestfriend or even dates. My ex is getting married now.. I'm finally sober but I can't get her back, our old house sold and demolished to pay for legal fees. I think my time on earth  is almost over guys. I don't have a plan yet but it's coming :("

That dark evil look that he has where I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on behind those eyes. I had a feeling the first night I was going to have sex whether I liked it or not. The look, that dark look told me I was right. I‚Äôm a bit older now, my body - especially my vagina, can‚Äôt handle the rough angry pawing of an abusive drunk man. I didn‚Äôt want sex. I went to sleep and woke up with it already in progress, his hands and mouth on me and in me. I disassociate and freeze when this happens. This is not consent. This was not love. This was him abusing me. The roughness, of course, caused some bleeding. I didn‚Äôt want to see it in my panties when I used the restroom, it‚Äôs traumatizing, so I had put a tampon in. I was shutting things out and shutting myself down. Disassociating. Feeling out of it. This happens a lot. One time 2 yrs ago it happened 3x in a week, not sure if 1 out of the 3 was anal, but I do remember he whispered something nasty in my ear as he got off of me that night. This time I did something I don‚Äôt normally do. I had wiped the bleeding away with a tissue. I threw it in the trash. The next morning, I picked it out of the trash and put it in a plastic bag. To remind myself? To say to myself, look - blood! Blood does not equal love! That night I put on a skims style body suit thing that goes to mid thigh, no holes or anything for my butt, you have to pull the whole thing down to use the restroom. On top of that, I put a sweater with very difficult to open buttons. The buttons are pearls and diamonds that snag and are cute but non functioning buttons, essentially. That‚Äôs what I went to sleep in. I have opened the buttons on that sweater like twice since I‚Äôve gotten it, bc they are difficult and it‚Äôs easier to throw over my head to put it on. That night I woke up because I was cold. I was naked. There was wetness. My knee was in a wet spot on the bed and my butt was wet and there were things being dripped onto my black side. My face was in the bed, and my butt was in the air. My knees were bent slightly spread. There was something in my asshole. I don‚Äôt know if it was his dick or fingers as I was in the process of waking up. I said no! Stop! And he grabbed me by the hips and pulled me back to him. I think the reason he went in my butt was because I had the tampon in. The tampon was in not bc of period, but due to his actions the night before which caused the bleeding in my vagina. So one night I get it vaginally, the next night I get it in the ass. I missed an event with the kids bc I got agitated and stressed and then I realized it was because I had lube coming out of my asshole. The first three images are what I wrote before he raped me vaginally. The second was after the anal rape the next night. He‚Äôs not having sex unbeknownst to himself in his sleep. His actions are deliberate. He knew and knows what he‚Äôs doing. I can look back and see that when this has happened before, that I was doing things for myself or better handling things emotionally. I thought I could suppress this one too. Only I couldn‚Äôt. The thought of giving his number to my surgeon‚Äôs office as someone to call in case of an emergency? I stuttered and started shaking. He had also told me it would make him happy if I died on the table during surgery. When I looked shocked and got up to leave he, of course as always, said it was a joke. It was just a joke. All the mean things he says to me, that‚Äôs just a joke or no he doesn‚Äôt remember saying that or flat out no he didn‚Äôt or he tries to change what he‚Äôs said. I‚Äôm in the process of trying to move out but y‚Äôall, there‚Äôs still that part of me that says the kids, it‚Äôs easier with kids to have two parents in the house. I work (according to him don‚Äôt contribute or do enough). I volunteer. I am shattered and can‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so hard to love me. I am broken and feel like emotionally I‚Äôm a burden to those around me and toxic. I live in a small-ish town, but I‚Äôve developed some friendships here and a small network here that I would have died without having. My health has suffered so much from this, to having a thyroid disease to a heart issue to debilitating allergies (celiac/dairy/nuts/etc). I don‚Äôt know what to do. My gp and psych say to make a police report and pursue criminal charges, but isn‚Äôt that for law & order svu? Ironically, it‚Äôs one of my favorite shows. He hates it and will not watch it/ allow me to because he says his ex wife used to watch it. Part of me wants to reach out and talk to her to see why they really got divorced. Did she experience this? I also found he has the Grindr app from august 2018 until it disappeared from my view (not necessarily ended, app could be hidden) May 2024. I don‚Äôt have money to afford the lifestyle, for that matter neither does he. I have two little ones here, and they are amazing and wonderful spirits that I can not believe I am blessed to be their mom. They are my little superstar heroes, they are so accomplished and do so many things and activities from sports to art to dance. I can‚Äôt let them down. I will not fail them. But I have, because I can‚Äôt give them all of me and who I am, all the good if me because my shine is so hidden by the walls I built to keep my heart beating and my lungs breathing. I tried to suppress it all and I crashed on my bike. Numb to the pain. I couldn‚Äôt cry. I couldn‚Äôt have an orgasm while masturbating. I used to be able to handle this and disassociate. I can not anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm running down a hill but I can‚Äôt control the direction. I‚Äôve been cleaning, that‚Äôs good. But I am so afraid I‚Äôm going to back slide and agree to stay with him. He‚Äôs the one who has screamed divorce at me hundreds of times. Now that I‚Äôve agreed (in November), he now doesn‚Äôt want to get divorced. I told him we are, I‚Äôm looking for a place yet he keeps sending me info on houses like it‚Äôs all normal, and that since he‚Äôs moved on from ‚Äúthe argument‚Äù I should just forgive him and move on too because why can‚Äôt I just forgive him. Don‚Äôt think there was one conversation about it, he doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it just wants me to ‚Äúforgive him and love him‚Äù. I need direction and strength, it‚Äôs hard to trust my thoughts because that‚Äôs how he‚Äôs made me be. My definition of love unto me is love=pain. I need strength to get through all of this. I need a lawyer and I don‚Äôt have money for one. I am lost but still need to lead, the kids and my coworkers. I am aware that I‚Äôll be pegged as the Xitch and bad guy in the divorce. I wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for letting me vent. No one knows the whole story of my marriage, it‚Äôs humiliating. Embarrassing. Traumatizing. Violating. Terrorizing. It‚Äôs so awful, silently I hate to see those happy people showing support and kind love to each other because I don‚Äôt know how that feels nor have I experienced that in a long time. I have a glimpse and a glimmer of hope now, but I don‚Äôt know what to trust anymore. He‚Äôs out of town until April, and I dread the return intensely. I have a quiet thought on repeat, when I‚Äôm making dinner or cleaning or breathing. It‚Äôs help me help me help me help me help me. I need to help myself but I‚Äôm so soul worn and broke tired of it all.

1jbxy01,I Think I Might be in Danger,ChewsFoodOnlyTwice,2,2025-03-15 15:43:54+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbxy01/i_think_i_might_be_in_danger/,"TW: Self harm 

Today is the first day in my life that I thought I was in serious danger by a romantic partner and I'm not exactly sure what to do. My partner has never physically abused me but I think he is trying to convince everyone around me that I'm suffering from severe postpartum depression, a danger to myself and our 6 month old. 

I'm not. I have struggled with suicidal ideation my whole life but since giving birth it has been non-existent. I suspect because I have a much stronger sense of self preservation now because my baby needs me. I have talked about this extensively with my therapist and mentioned it several times to my husband. 

We're going through a divorce. A contested divorce because he won't agree to a divorce. Last week he reported me to CPS for a whole bunch of stuff that were either straight up lies or not abuse at all (he told them that I keep threatening to get a divorce.. my divorce lawyer accompanied me and we all just kind of paused for a second..) one of the things he said was that I was suicidal. I told them that was absolutely not true. I have a whole team of medical professionals that I meet with regularly to make sure my medication is working and that I have emotional guidance. I have a therapist I meet with once a week. I have support groups. I released my therapy notes to them to prove that since I have given birth I have not expressed that I am a danger to myself or others. 

After the meeting, hearing the things he accused me of, and having explained what was actually happening (he is intimidating me into thinking that if I go through with the divorce I won't get custody) I was afraid of him in a whole new way. The accusations were wild. The idea that he would accuse me of abusing our child or worse for divorcing him (he reported me the same day I told him I was going through with the contested divorce) was terrifying. Those types of actions have real life repercussions. 

I went home to visit my family (my step dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer this week) and while I was talking about the DCS meeting my family members started telling me that he has been trying to convince them that I am suicidal and homicidal for months. He called my mom and told her he ""knows the signs"" (he doesn't.. he knows nothing about my mental health conditions because he doesn't like talking about it and he screams at me every time I try to talk about it) h told her that I'm in a dangerous place. She was obviously like ""No I know my daughter better than you and I know what she's experiencing right now and it's not that"" and he argued with her! Yelling at her to not ""downplay this"" because it's ""serious""! She ignored him and just shut the conversation down. Last weekend I left a family event crying because I was given the cold shoulder (gee I wonder why.. know now that he's been saying outlandish things about me) and he called my brother and my mom and gave them weird cryptic messages that hinted at the fact that I was in immediate danger. My brother showed up at my house before I got there. My mom called me frantic. It was ridiculous and I told them it was ridiculous. I was just normal person sad about a normal person sad event and I wanted to go home instead of being in a place I didn't feel welcome. 

I remembered this morning that he occasionally tries to tell me I have said some very very strange things in the past that I KNOW I haven't because I have never even had the thought or feeling related to them. He sold his car a few years ago to buy something and now he's trying to convince everyone I made him sell his car so that he ""couldn't leave me"". Which is absolutely ridiculous. I do not want to force someone to be with me and I'M THE ONE WHO IS TRYING TO LEAVE. 

I have been thinking about all this stuff for days because it doesn't make any sense to me. He doesn't want a divorce but says all these wild things about me. He doesn't work and that's part of why we're getting a divorce. He says I can't make him work and I say he can't force me to financially support him and I will divorce him if that is what it takes. So why would he be doing all this stuff? He needs me to keep a roof over his head. 


It occurred to me that when I was once hospitalized for suicidal thoughts (before I had the baby) they called him to ask him if he was comfortable with me going home. At the time, we joked about it because that's a potentially dangerous situation to put a woman in. I told him how once when I was hospitalized I met a woman who was running away from her abusive husband and he called the police and told them she had snapped and was a danger to herself. She was in there for over a month. She had to go to court and get a judge to order her removal. He did. 

It occurred to me today that it's possible he is trying to get me into a hospital for ""postpartum depression"". It would get me out of the house (that I own) and paychecks would keep coming in (from my job!) because I would be out on medical leave and he could idk. Use that to prove I'm an unfit mother in court? I don't even know what the end goal is. I don't know what's going on. But I'm afraid to go back home. "

Just said he was going out. I did some things around the house then called (he didn't answer) and texted him to check in, asked if he'll be out for much longer. He didn't reply for about a half hour so I decided to go to a bar I like to have a drink, get out of the house. When I told him I was going out, he immediately jumps to accusing me of going to meet guys, saying ""Enjoy whoever you end up with wherever you're going,"" ""Enjoy whoever you meet wherever you're going,"" ""I'm sure you'll get the attention you're looking for,"" ""You'll pick up some [instagram] followers in the coming days I'm sure."" When I said he was being demeaning, he said ""You're being delusional."" For the couple hrs I was at the bar, I sat in the corner by myself,  writing in my journal and texting with him, trying to hold back tears. I was going to get a second drink, but didn't want to end up getting more emotional, so I went home. He texts me at 12:30 saying he'll be back soon. I went to sleep around 2:30 and he still wasn't back.
I cant stand to even look at him right now. He's going to justify every fucking thing he said and make it all my fault. Again. "

1jbweba,I think I might have escaped an abusive relationship,Outrageous_Contest91,8,2025-03-15 14:32:47+00:00,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbweba/i_think_i_might_have_escaped_an_abusive/,"Hello,

I am sorry if this is a useless post or insulting to survivors on this thread but I have been thinking back on my relationship that I just escaped.

I (23f) and him (22m) meet in college and it goes really well for the first two months. We were together for a total of five months. I had never been in a relationship before him and had no frame of reference for proper relationships. He was very kind and loving for the first couple months. 

He went out of his way to see me or do nice things but I always had a feeling that something wasn‚Äôt right. Not in an obvious ways but I would feel anxious at the thought of being in my apartment alone with him at the start or I felt I couldn‚Äôt dress fully comfortable around him. Then he would get drunk and he would say mean and degrading things to me and I did try to break up with him when he first said that but he said everything I wanted to hear and did everything a girl could want. 

A week later we celebrate his birthday, mine was two days after. 
He had forgotten and we had an argument, he apologised and asked for another chance I said yes because I wanted to believe that this man did actually care about me.

Eventually, he starts ignoring me when I felt depressed and anxious, he started comparing me with a woman who he swore he didn‚Äôt like that much, he would do this after being intimate with each other. 
I asked to break up and he agrees and I take the opportunity to just tell him everything because I was never going to speak to him again after the phone went down, I hated the way he made me feel. 

I was crying on the phone and I knew we‚Äôre done but I begged to do the bare minimum and he said he couldn‚Äôt do it. He asked me to stay on the phone while I was crying and he started saying that I am enough and I was a good girlfriend. 

Once I said I know I‚Äôm good enough and this hasn‚Äôt affected my self esteem he got nasty and couldn‚Äôt wait to hang up the phone. I gave him back his stuff including a necklace he gave me the first time we were intimate and he took said it was an awful necklace and he was going to throw it in the trash. I stood up, took my stuff and said goodbye with my head held high.

This was obviously not fantastic but then I thought back on how he would make comments about how I eat, how I‚Äôm heavy or how I‚Äôm too muscular. I lost 20lbs being with him because I couldn‚Äôt eat near him and when I was away I felt nauseous. He would be nice a lot of the time but he had a snide remark whenever he knew I was going to be away from him. His favourite photo of me was when he made me cry for two hours straight and then I had to get dolled up for dinner. 

There is more stuff about our times being intimate and how he wasn‚Äôt always the nicest but it was consensual, just not fun or romantic.

I apologise if I am being dramatic and I most likely wasn‚Äôt in an abusive relationship but so many people in my life would ask questions about my relationship that teeter on asking whether he ever hurt me. 

Edit: Thank you all for responding so quickly and so kindly. I haven‚Äôt really spoken in detail about the breakup as it only happened two days ago and I was afraid that I would come across like a scorned ex. I knew something was wrong when I visited my friend yesterday. They live about 20 minutes from his home, I started to dry heave and panic even though I knew he was in work because I was so afraid of him just seeing me."

He keeps complimenting me saying I'm sexy,beautiful  i look great etc.... he was ok when I couldnt help react negatively  he was on top of me last night and I ended up telling him to hurry and finish. And he actually said I can talk to him if I have any problems with him or relationship don't keep it to your self u can tell me anything.  He's being a completely different person. And it's making me even more confused and guilty. Especially as I viewed a flat this week and planning to leave soon.  I'm so so confused like have I got all that's happened wrong? Or has he finally realised what he was doing and as changed himself permanently?  I have told him loads of times about things he as been doing and it gets denied/speaks over me etc.. and he doesn't do anything or say sorry or blames me.

1jbtazk,I discovered more..,Lavendarr2826,3,2025-03-15 11:44:39+00:00,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbtazk/i_discovered_more/,"I just need to talk. Keeping everything to myself is exhausting. I can‚Äôt talk to him about it‚Äîhe always becomes hostile, aggressive, and somehow turns it all back on me. It‚Äôs like clockwork. And with the kids here, I don‚Äôt want them to see him like that.

The other day, I calmly asked if he told his parents something personal about me. I always approach these things with an open mind, trying to be fair. Most of the time, I already know the answer‚ÄîI just want to give him the chance to be honest. I need him to be honest. There was a time I literally begged on my knees, sobbing on the couch while he walked past me without a shred of remorse. I even wrote him the most heartfelt letter, hoping to get through to him. Total failure. His response? Dismissive, rude, full of denial. I couldn‚Äôt even finish reading the letter he wrote back.

Anyway, back to the other day. I asked him, and as expected, he lied. I put my feelings aside and reassured him that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal‚ÄîI just wanted to know what they knew, since I‚Äôd be seeing them soon. But he kept lying. And then, like always, he got angry. His favorite line: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done nothing wrong. I‚Äôm not lying. You need to accept that.‚Äù I even tried to minimize it so he wouldn‚Äôt feel so defensive, but it was useless. Eventually, I let it go. He‚Äôs exhausting. Maybe that‚Äôs what he wants‚Äîme, weak.

Later, at the hospital visiting my dad, I don‚Äôt remember exactly how it came up again. Maybe he asked why I was upset, and I probably just said something like, ‚ÄúI give up. I just wish you‚Äôd be honest with me.‚Äù As we walked to the elevators, his tone shifted, that familiar edge creeping in. I told him to calm down. In the elevator, I finally just repeated back a snippet of the exact conversation he had with his mom. He stopped mid-sentence.

Then, just the other day, I asked about his sobriety. He‚Äôs a porn addict‚Äîa sex addict, really. That‚Äôs a whole other story about how I got caught up with him in the first place. He‚Äôs never actually been sober. I told him I knew he wasn‚Äôt doing well. I didn‚Äôt even bring up everything else, just the porn. He still lied. He got aggressive, started yelling, slammed the car door on me, then drove off.

Later, he admitted he got ‚Äúheated‚Äù because he doesn‚Äôt like feeling backed into a corner. Finally, he admitted he hadn‚Äôt been doing well. But by the end of the day, the same cycle repeated‚Äîdenial, defensiveness. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done nothing wrong.‚Äù He‚Äôs never done anything wrong, according to him. It‚Äôs all nonsense, apparently.

The frustrating part? I see his patterns. I recognize the abuse. He knows I do‚Äîthat‚Äôs why he shuts down and repeats his rehearsed lines instead of addressing anything.

I don‚Äôt even know why I put myself through this cycle. I know he won‚Äôt tell me the truth. He‚Äôs even gone as far as accusing me of planting evidence when I confront him. And yet, there‚Äôs this part of me that still hopes‚Äîhopes he‚Äôll show me that he loves me, that he cares. It‚Äôs pathetic, really.

It‚Äôs heartbreaking to know so much and have to keep it in, because if I don‚Äôt, he‚Äôll emotionally abuse me. He‚Äôs called me crazy.

Someone who claims to love you shouldn‚Äôt make you question your own reality just so they can continue lying. I say ‚Äúattempt‚Äù because I know too much for him to gaslight me fully‚Äîbut it‚Äôs still so, so wrong. How can someone do this to another human being, let alone their partner?

The worst part? The mindfuck of it all. Because he can be loving, sweet. We have fun together. But I understand now‚Äîit‚Äôs not enough. And it never will be.

And the projection? That‚Äôs the kicker. Anything I call him out on‚Äîhis emotional abuse, gaslighting, manipulation‚Äîhe throws it all back at me in the next argument, word for word, but in the wrong context. It‚Äôs exhausting.

And now, I‚Äôve discovered more. I know who two of the other women are. Oh right, yesterday when he came out of the shower, he had scratches on his neck and shoulders. I‚Äôll post photos. I don‚Äôt know, maybe he loves her. 

I wish he loved me. But I strongly believe the cheating excites him. It‚Äôs all he ever reads about. 

How could I be so stupid? How do I still love this man? I love him so deeply, and it hurts that I‚Äôm not enough. Why are you with me? Why are you doing this to me? How can you say you love someone while being the one to put the knife in their back? You are fucking killing me. How can you not feel any remorse? I‚Äôm literally shaking in tears. I don‚Äôt even know who he is, but I wish he would prove that he cared. God this hurts so much. 

We had a daughter together, and I gave her the worst man to look up to. I just hope with all my heart she never ends up with someone like him.

If anyone wants to read our messages or the letter I wrote him, I‚Äôll share.


I‚Äôll have to make a new post to show photos as I can‚Äôt add them with the edit "
1jbrqz8,Attorney Recommendations in Georgia,chelsbellsatl,2,2025-03-15 09:56:10+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbrqz8/attorney_recommendations_in_georgia/,"I'm currently separated from my abusive spouse. Before we split, he was incredibly emotionally, financially, and verbally abusive. He controlled all of our finances and frequently threatened to cut me off and/or sell everything and disappear. After a series of incidents that eventually escalated and became public, we split in July and have been living separately since. 

Before we split, he had me sign and notarize a separation agreement in which we divided assets (he controlled all finances, and did the analysis of our wealth) and he agreed to pay $1000/mo in alimony for 4 years. The intent was to file pro se, and wrap things up quickly, both to protect his reputation and our mutual financial well being. 

As you might expect, the abusive partner never filed. Now, he doesn't want to pay alimony and is doing everything in his power to lose his job and drain his assets before we get the divorce going. I've filed for a TPO to stop him from draining assets (and harassing me, an ongoing issue) but it hasn't been served to him yet as he's hiding at his new girlfriend's house and I don't have the address. 

I'm able to survive off of what we divided already, but will need the alimony to obtain health insurance as it isn't offered through my position. I make like 1/10th of what my spouse does, and have no assets to fall back on. (He owns a 400k+ house, a Tesla M3, etc) 

I am desperately seeking an affordable divorce attorney in DeKalb County, Georgia who can help me with this case. I need representation both for the divorce and the TPO. I'm also considering a defamation suit, which would need to be filed soon to stay within the one year SOL. Any recommendations?"

I tried one tonight and it was so positive that I immediately thought it would be good for so many victims.

The only issue I can see is that it transcribes the abuse and then it links to ChatGPT to give an analysis. In my case that was so very positive. You constantly worry that you are overreacting or did something wrong so it was nice to see ChatGPT say positive things when it was a ""neutral"" party.

The problem I can potentially see is that it might be negative to an abused person without proper context or that it may end up being too ""understanding"" of an abuser. In general AI can sometimes present a person in the best light and I am afraid it might do it for someones abuser. In my case it was overall fairly negative to my abuser but I could see that not being the case for every recording. I'm going to include a small section that only reveals general information about my situation:

# What This Teaches Us About Family Dynamics

1. **Pain and Compassion Often Coexist** Parents can be hurting, and in their pain, they may say things they don‚Äôt mean. They may lash out or fail to see the struggles of their partners. But families that hold space for compassion‚Äîespecially when voiced by children‚Äîcan offer opportunities for healing.
2. **Children Are Active Participants in Family Narratives** Children notice more than we think. They interpret, advocate, and try to make sense of the dynamics around them. Their perspectives can offer clarity and sometimes a deeper wisdom, as the child demonstrates in this exchange.
3. **Emotional Safety is Essential** Even amid conflict, it‚Äôs possible to create moments of safety and reassurance. The father‚Äôs tender words and actions toward his children are a testament to the role of emotional security in navigating family challenges.

I have moved on and been happily married for 4 months. I knew from old friends that he was unhappy when he found out about the marriage, but has not tried to contact me about it directly. 

I just received two back-to-back emails, one from Aflac wanting to contact me and the second one from the Jehovah‚Äôs witness website wanting to confirm that I scheduled a visit. I DID NOT GO TO THESE WEBSITES My first thought was that my ex signed my email up for these things in order to be harassed by the sales people/witnesses, but any chance it could just be scam emails? I think I would rather it be scam emails, the ex thing majorly freaks me out because I thought I finally escaped him. "

1jbntb0,Concerned about things my husband said last night,SofiaB04,52,2025-03-15 05:07:26+00:00,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbntb0/concerned_about_things_my_husband_said_last_night/,"
In January my husband repeatedly raped me over the course of a month. I have had a very hard time dealing with this, having panic attacks almost daily and dissociating so much I have been losing time. He has since been acting like nothing happened. I ended up leaving for 9 days because my anxiety was so bad I felt I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. 

I ended up going back 3 days ago after he called, acknowledged what he did and said he wants to work on the marriage. I also felt very guilty about his emotional state. When I came back we had a long discussion, in which I asked him why he would do something that he knew he could go back to prison for if I reported him. He told me if I called the police he would just kill himself. 

I told him that I am afraid of him, and that I am 99 percent sure he would never kill me, but there is still 1 percent. I asked if he knew what it felt like to not be 100 percent sure your partner would kill you. He said ""actually, yes. I've always been afraid might try to kill me if I left you"". I immediately broke down in tears because I could never hurt him, and have given him no reason to think I would. He also told me he has been paranoid for months I might use one of his combat knives to kill him in his sleep. This seemed like a really bizarre thing to say, because, again, I am not a violent person at all.  Now I am wondering if maybe he is setting up some kind of defense? It was such a violent image, and he does have a combat knife in our bedroom. Am I right to be concerned about this? "

My poor daughter. Her little face. The screams, the tears, the absolute horror. First thing he did was of course to smash my phone completely. Thank God my kind neighbour called the police. He was gone before they came and they're looking for him now. I'm so happy I had the strength to walk away 2 years ago, but I thought he found another me and left me in peace. He looked so disgusting, just repulsive, much older, with black evil eyes. I just wish even after 2 years I shouldn't have been so relaxed about the door, I must always remain cautious. And I wish I hid my phone. I'm just grateful we survived this. But why. It's crazy what a human can do to another human. Why are you still trying to torture me? You want me to suffer. You think that will make me...erm... Like you again? Love you? Take you back? Crazy. Never. I was dumb 2 years ago still hoping ""he will change"". I remember the very first incident, a policewoman said ""look girl, I'm telling you now and you will mention my words-he will never ever change, you need to start the healing process now"". God, I wish I had my eyes open then. I know I'm his property and he wants control, but can you just finally get a life and left me be?"

I was reading the body keeps score today and one little section reminded me of him (it was talking about the little joys and it described what he used to say he enjoys with me)

I unblocked him. Then felt stressed almost immediately. Feeling tension in my forehead. It's the first time I've noticed I have those intensely stressed reactions and he wasn't even phsycially around. 

I needed something external (a notification) wake me up from that moment and then I re-blocked him. Felt much better straight away.

I think I'm starting to slowly process he's not a good person and slowly starting to stop suppressing the fear."

I've been hesitant to post here because I'm not sure that my situation is nearly the same as the horrible things that other people here go through. I couldn't find another subreddit that seemed to fit what I want to talk about and I don't really have anyone I trust to speak to about this with. 

My partner and I have only started being intimate recently, but I've encountered a problem with it; They wont stop hurting me. They like to bite me, really hard. it leaves bruises on me, especially in my throat area. It makes it hard to swallow and move around properly and I don't like the way it looks. I've told them i dont want them to do it but they do anyways. after i flinched away really badly one time they suggested that we do a test where they bite me harder and harder until i cant take it so that they can know how hard to bite. I said no i really don't want to do that but they kept asking and i said no. I was really scared of them for the first time ever im not really sure why. but they are bigger than me and were on top of me and then they kind of did it anyway. they didn't outright say it but they bit me a few more times harder and harder until i flinched again then they didn't go harder. they also did it on other parts of me that are swollen and sore now. my flinching seems to just encourage them to keep going

why are they so insistent on biting me to this point? i don't know a lot about sex or like less vanilla stuff. is it normal for biting to reach this point? I could probably learn to get over it but it ended up really bad and it was like i wasn't even in my own body anymore. sometimes i enjoy being intimate when it doesn't hurt but 98% of the time im just thinking about anything else or thinking about when it will be over. am i just inexperienced in this sort of thing? I know some people enjoy being bitten and all that but this feels really extreme and not... right"

I asked to take my break and when I got back from my break he seemed to have left. He never spoke to me and I avoided him as much as possible. 

A day after that, I found out he unblocked me. If he hates me as much as he says he does, if he plays the victim so hard, why did he unblock me? I still have him blocked so he can't message me, but I am scared. It makes me so uncomfortable that he is thinking about me. I don't want to talk to him. i don't want to see him.

For a year I wanted an apology, an acknowledgment of the pain he caused me. Now I just want to be left alone. I'm trying to be happy again. So why unblock me? Why do that when he has a girlfriend, when he makes songs about how horrible I am?

I am still scared of him finding me again. I don't ever want to be where I was when I was with him. I still deal with PTSD all the time. I never want to see him again. I hate him."

and to be fair I did make mistakes and the most valuable lesson I learned from this experience was that even though the intentions were never pure, my eyes were opened to behaviors I could improve upon.

I don't know if I can ever truly trust anyone ever again. She broke me. She used me.

!!!I am safely out of this relationship.!!!


I dated a bloke who had autism. However for four years he insisted that I had borderline personality disorder. Is this normal for an autistic person to blame someone for having borderline personality disorder when relationships take work?. 

Even when we argued (as most people do in relationships as they are not perfect!!) he‚Äôd accuse me of having borderline personality disorder because I was assertive and confident. I stood my ground and called him out when he was unfair. I too have flaws but I don‚Äôt angrily say my partner has borderline personality disorder when things don‚Äôt go well. 

He is just a past relationship with no verified credentials to dish out the complex nature of borderline personality disorder or personality disorders for that matter. 

How do I overcome this toxic relationship. Yes it‚Äôs over. 

I‚Äôm in therapy but I just need some support and additional support. 

How did you handle your boyfriend or girlfriend constantly attacking your character and saying that you had borderline personality disorder.?"

I used to cry a lot and let him know that what he was doing was hurting me. He would apologize, but the behavior always repeated.

Then, about 3.5 to 4 years into our relationship, I went to therapy for completely unrelated reasons. I had developed pretty bad anxiety and had also lost all sexual desire, so I decided to seek help. My therapist never told me I was being abused or even suggested it, but she did tell me to establish boundaries‚Äîand I did. One day, I kind of blew up and told him,¬†*""I don't even know if I love you anymore. I can't stand living like this.""*¬†It was a huge shock for him. He promised he would work on himself and change.

I was happy to hear that, but, honestly, I had already built up a lot of resentment and couldn't let go of the past. So, even after about six months of my boyfriend (now husband) being nice to me, my sexual desire didn‚Äôt return, and eventually, he stopped trying. I understood his frustration and the pain of feeling emotionally rejected, but I couldn‚Äôt force my desire to come back.

We ended up getting married for legal reasons, but at the time, it felt like the natural next step because our relationship¬†**wasn‚Äôt that bad**¬†back then. However, after getting married, my anxiety skyrocketed. I also started struggling with eating in public (don‚Äôt even ask, it‚Äôs horrible). That‚Äôs how a few years passed‚Äî**a dead bedroom, a lack of emotional** and physical **connection, and mostly arguments**‚Äîwhere, at least from my perspective, he disrespected me (he says I disrespected him).

Fast forward to now: It‚Äôs been a year since I quit a job I hated to focus on my own projects, while he has been financially providing for us. I appreciate him for that, and I do take care of our apartment and our dog‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt cook because I hate it (though according to him, that‚Äôs not even the biggest issue). Unfortunately, after a year of working on multiple projects, none of them have been successful yet. I‚Äôm not sure if they ever will be, but I‚Äôm not losing hope.

Recently, we've been having¬†**lots**¬†of arguments because:

1. **He resents me**¬†for not contributing my ‚Äúfair share‚Äù to the relationship.
2. **I resent him**¬†for constantly putting me down and emotionally neglecting me.

# Some Things He Has Said to Me:

* During an argument about budgeting, I pushed back, and he said: **""You better start with, 'Okay, let‚Äôs see if we can make it work,' not all that other bullshit you give me. Anything having to do with money‚Äîas far as I‚Äôm concerned‚Äîyou have way less say than I do.""**
* **""You‚Äôve gotten way more out of this relationship than I have, just because I work and you don‚Äôt.""**
* **""Nobody has a better setup than you. Nobody lives a life as nice as yours.""**

I offered therapy because I honestly don‚Äôt believe we can fix this without professional help. He said he¬†**doesn‚Äôt need therapy and doesn‚Äôt want it.**¬†After I brought it up again and he said no, I told him that he was shutting me down. His reply:

* **""What‚Äôs wrong with you? What‚Äôs your problem? Get your shit together. Get your fucking shit together. You‚Äôre such a fucking weirdo. Just stop being such an odd person. Just hear yourself. Don‚Äôt you understand that this isn‚Äôt even likable?""**
* **""Your videos (I have a YouTube channel) probably aren‚Äôt working because you‚Äôre so cringe. You can‚Äôt even do the videos with me in the house‚Äîyou‚Äôre probably so cringe.""**¬†(When I told him this was disrespectful, he said it was¬†*honest*.)
* **""Just look at yourself, just look at yourself. Who the hell would want you? Honestly, the only reason I stay with you is because I‚Äôve known you for so long. I‚Äôve loved you, you know, but like, in your state, as of right now‚Äîsomebody brand new? No sex, not getting anything done, not cooking, not caring?""**"

He has never laid a hand on me intentionally, and only ever jokingly threatens to. But recently, I'm starting to question if when he does ""accidentally hurt me"" if it's truly an accident. Because he was holding his controller and I was sitting next to him and then suddenly he wanted to lift it so he accidentally hit me with it. Even though my chair was lower, I feel bad for questioning that he did it on accident, but even in the moment, it just didn't feel or seem accidental. I hate thinking this way of him or questioning him, but I can't help it. I wish I could just move on and everything be fine."

But I just couldn‚Äôt anymore and as a survivor a 10 year old highly abusive  relationship I knew and could see all the signs. 

I‚Äôm looking for someone to tell me I did the right thing (I left during love bombing so really just as devaluation started but because of that, things hadn‚Äôt gotten really bad yet which makes it harder‚Ä¶)

These are the issues I noted:

- aggressively love bombed me told me he loved me the first week we met (and made soulmate declarations) and was literally talking about marriage and moving in within days of us meeting. 
- he hid it at first but I realized that he is a major alcoholic. Drinks often right when he wakes up. His version of cutting him back on drinking was to have 3-4 drinks a day. 
- I noticed major triangulation issues involving him talking about other women being attracted to him, I assume to make me jealous or insecure. The last straw for me was being out with him when he basically ignored me and chatted with a bartender and later mentioned that he thought she was someone ‚Äúhe would be dating if he wasn‚Äôt dating someone else‚Äù. 
- there were numerous instances of me noticing inconsistencies in things he said over time. Probably, related to the alcohol but there might be more there. (Ex: Told me a long and detailed story about recently going to a restaurant with his ex wife to deal with some paperwork / legal docs related to his divorce and how she kept trying to kiss him and he turned down her advances. When I mentioned the restaurant later on again he said ‚Äúhe had never been there‚Äù) 
- all of his exes are ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù and abusive to him 
- he is currently being investigated by hr for pursuing a subordinate at work (this is an attractive, younger woman who rejected him and he still stays ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with and really ‚Äúwanted me to meet‚Äù which all seemed kind of weird to me if I‚Äôm being honest- also reeked of triangulation to me)
- physically assaulted his ex (he‚Äôs a big dude and she‚Äôs a small woman) because she was abusive to him. He has been married twice and claims both exes were abusive to him. 

There‚Äôs even more examples of weird shit that has raised my alarm bells over the past few weeks and I finally pulled the plug yesterday and have been shocked at how cold he‚Äôs been. He went from ‚ÄúI love you so much‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live without you‚Äù to dropped my stuff off and not even arguing with me to stay and as much as I know this is a blessing and I needed to do this, it hurts. 

I guess I‚Äôm looking for reassurance that I did the right thing (cognitively I know I did, but emotionally is different)

1jbbehy,What do I do?,Individual-Pin7128,2,2025-03-14 19:00:50+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbbehy/what_do_i_do/,"My husband and I have been together for 8ish years, married for 4.5. We have 3 boys ages 5, 3, and 6 months. We have a house that we fully own, I‚Äôm a SAHM, and my husband makes decent money at his job. My husband is almost 32 and I am 36. 

My husband, for as long as we have been together, has had a horrible money spending and lying habit. He hides it like an addiction and always ALWAYS gets caught. We have argued about this every 3-6 months for the past 6ish years. We have a joint account that he doesn‚Äôt spend, but he has a personal account that he puts $800/month into. It ALL goes towards food, video game garbage (he plays for an hour or so after everyone goes to bed), and supplements like greens and pre workout. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other crap, but from what I‚Äôve seen, $20/day goes to takeout at work. I had tried to get him to bring lunch but he never tells me when he needs more lunch ‚Äúsupplies‚Äù. Over the years, he racked up over $20k in debt and his parents bailed him out of $17k of it. This is just a short, tip of the iceberg version. 

We have fought dozens of times about his spending and lying. He goes to therapy a few times after each argument and then goes right back to his habits. I finally caved and told his parents absolutely everything he does/has done. I will honestly say that I told them in hopes of him losing an ally because he was never fully honest with them. Our previous discussion about this was really good and I felt like he was going to change. Now, we are under the same roof and barely speaking. 

Do we try marriage counseling? Kids complicate this much more. I would stay together for the kids if that meant we can get past this. But I want them to know what a healthy relationship looks like and we are anything but that right now. I need to hear stories of hope and experience. He‚Äôs not a bad person, is great with the kids, and you would never guess he would have these skeletons in his closet. But I can‚Äôt live like this anymore. We were so madly in love, but every lie has stolen more and more of that from us.

1jbaujn,I hope you see this.,Complete-Horror-3420,6,2025-03-14 18:37:17+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbaujn/i_hope_you_see_this/,"I used to have another reddit account that i‚Äôve since deleted, but i‚Äôve made this new one as a throw away. On my old account, I made a few posts after breaking up with my abusive ex, he found it and gave advice acting as if he was another person. Shit like ‚Äúoh maybe he need another chance you should forgive him‚Äù ‚Äúoh maybe he need mental help, you should be there and support him‚Äù his exact words since he couldn‚Äôt speak english fluently. After blocking him on all social media and forgetting about that account for months, he messages me on there almost a year after our break up, i get the email notification and immediately delete the account without reading what he says. Because i don‚Äôt want to ever hear or read a word that comes out of his mouth. 

Anyways. I‚Äôm here to rant, because i want to move on, but i know i won‚Äôt be able to without getting all of this shit off my chest. 

I think about how he used to want to be on facetime 24/7. If i wanted to play on my computer he‚Äôd get upset, if i wanted to watch tv or draw, i couldn‚Äôt if i wanted to crochet, i couldn‚Äôt, ALL because my attention wasn‚Äôt on him. The only time he let me crochet while i was talking to him was because i was making HIM a blanket. I said i was shocked he let me crochet while we were on facetime and he said ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre making that for me‚Äù. If i wasn‚Äôt doing something for him or giving him attention, he got so ANGRY. 

When we would watch movies over call, he‚Äôd make me watch on my pc while I had my phone camera pointed at my face so he could make sure that i‚Äôm watching the movie. If i looked away from the screen at all he‚Äôd end the movie and start yelling at me. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing why aren‚Äôt you watching the movie‚Äù ‚Äútell me why you weren‚Äôt watching the movie‚Äù over and over and over again for hours until i gave an answer that he was satisfied with. 

A lot of times I‚Äôd give an honest answer to something he was angry about, but if it didn‚Äôt match with the reason he had in his head he‚Äôd go ballistic and would yell and argue until i just ended up agreeing with his answer instead, just to end the yelling. He was breaking down my spirit. 

Once when i got very sick, he wanted me to come over and kept persisting so i gave in. He got so angry over  that i didn‚Äôt want to have sex with him, and that‚Äôs I was sleeping too much. Once I ended up getting a UTI, and he got SO PISSED at me for ‚Äúnot taking care of myself or keeping myself clean‚Äù and was yelling at me for an hour before i had to send him multiple articles saying that women can get UTI‚Äôs from literally anything. 

He‚Äôd start so many fights about SUCH CHILDISH SHIT. He went through my reposts on tiktok, found a video about SHIRTLESS GOJO that i had reposted SIX MONTHS BEFORE i had even met him. He got really pissed about it and i had to sit there sobbing while he yelled at me.  Im sure so many of you know the feeling, being yelled at over and over and over, them repeating the same argument. over. and over. and over. until you‚Äôre just sitting there wanting to claw off your own skin out of anger and frustration. 
 
He also borrowed my switch lite and then ended up selling it and tried to act like he still had it. Had to fully confront him about it before he admitted it. He gave  the excuse of ‚Äúoh i didn‚Äôt think you really used it, i was also going to let you use mine instead‚Äù might i point out ‚ÄúUSE‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúGIVE‚Äù. If he had given me his switch or the money it wouldn‚Äôt have been so upsetting. 

Before we broke up, i had brought up the word ‚ÄúVerbal abuse‚Äù to him, he went crazy and started saying that he couldn‚Äôt have possibly abused me because i was the one making him sad and angry, and how he was the one taking care of me and buying stuff for me. Oh yes, the abuse just doesn‚Äôt exist because he bought a couple meals for me apparently!

When I sent him article after article, video after video of every sigh of emotional and verbal abuse, it was so obvious that even he had admitted it. We broke up, i posted to reddit seeking help, and that‚Äôs when he did what i said above. Pretended to be someone else and get me to go back to him. Even signed off his message with ‚Äúsending hugs‚Äù the thought makes me want to puke. 

I really hope he sees this. I hope he sees this and a pit of sorrow and regret fills his stomach. 
If you see this, do NOT show up to my house, i WILL call the police and file a restraining order. Do NOT message me or comment on hers, I WILL OPENLY call you out. 

I‚Äôll be posting more in the comments whenever things pop into my head. There‚Äôs A LOT more I have to say.

so, the idea of me ‚Äúmaking him like this‚Äù has been a common theme in our relationship. he basically says i was mentally unstable since the beginning and i pushed him this far, and that i am actually the abusive one. this has always been confusing for me because i was mentally unstable when we got together, and i actually did hit him first, so he‚Äôs always been able to use that against me. he fails to remember that i hit him because for months of me crying for him to stop looking at other women online, he just laughed in my face and called me crazy over and over. 

anyways, i really truly do believe that he believes he is a victim, in his own fucked up brain. he sees himself as a good person, and i‚Äôm the abuser. even after berating me, calling me every name in the book, cheating on me multiple times, strangling me multiple times, threatening to rape me for months, and finally sexually assaulting me while i literally screamed and cried and begged him to stop‚Ä¶. he still somehow manages to play the victim. he even went so far to say that i raped him at the beginning of the relationship, 7 years ago. i do remember this instance, we had rough sex and i was the aggressor instead of him, but it always seemed consensual, and it was never brought up until literally 24 hours after he assaulted me. so somehow i was the bad guy again and i ‚Äúruined sex‚Äù for him. but he didnt start getting rapey until about 4 months ago. it‚Äôs so confusing. i left almost 6 weeks ago, and now he is discarding me. part of me is grateful because i wasnt strong enough to go no contact myself, but another part of me is heartbroken. i wish he could see the pain and trauma he has caused me. 

edit: yes, i‚Äôve read the book. he‚Äôs definitely The Water Torturer and The Victim. intellectualizing it doesnt help how shitty and confused i feel right now though üò™"
