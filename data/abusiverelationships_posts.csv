1jcsndx,Has resorted to using literal torture tactics like sleep deprivation,grandpagrandpa1,1,2025-03-16 18:52:02+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcsndx/has_resorted_to_using_literal_torture_tactics/,"It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I am able to figure out when he starts fighting just to fight with me, and I won‚Äôt engage. So now he‚Äôs resorted to punishing me by bringing my close familial relationships and other triggering info into the fights that is in no way relevant. I‚Äôm used to the regular slew of insults and garbage. Last night was absolutely insane and a step further into more crazily abusive territory.

He fought with me for TWELVE hours. He started with me at 9 PM, accusing me of being in a ‚Äúbad mood‚Äù when absolutely nothing was wrong. Fought with me until almost 3 AM. I desperately tried to disengage and end things. I fell asleep for 3 hours. He woke me up at 6 AM, and fought with me until 9:30 AM, forcing me to stay awake. He did all this so that he wouldn‚Äôt have to do something for me today that we had planned to do all week. I called him out at the beginning of the fight and said, ‚Äúare you picking a fight with me so you don‚Äôt have to [do this thing for me] tomorrow?‚Äù He easily proved me right.

I quickly debunked everything he was arguing about and finally lost my mind because he you can only be told you ain‚Äôt shit and deprived of sleep for so long. I called him out on his own bullshit and he couldn‚Äôt handle it, so he went back to his usual DARVO responses ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt love me üò§‚Äù ‚Äúyou hate me üò§‚Äù ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt give a shit about me üò§‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so ungrateful üò§.‚Äù And it‚Äôs so funny when I pull up conversations of me being the world‚Äôs greatest most loving attentive thankful girlfriend. 

I‚Äôm so fucking beyond exhausted, they are energy vampires and not allowing me to physically sleep was absolute insanity. I‚Äôm used to being abused and torn to shreds but I‚Äôm not used to literal physical torture. Especially because I take prescribed sleep/anxiety medication that makes it harder for me to stay awake, causing confusion and also rendering the medication useless because my adrenaline fights through it. Then I have to take more to achieve sleep/fight intense panic, putting me in a negative position with my doctor and pharmacy. ",,,

I asked him if he wanted to go look at it while i do the chores and see if it was something we wanted to get the truck out for. The truck is parked behind some things so figured he can see if it‚Äôs worth digging the truck out. 

He said no and he wanted to go with me, so I said something along the lines of I don‚Äôt know what would be considered a good freezer and we can kill two birds with one stone while he looked at it and I did chores. He just said in an annoyed tone ‚Äúwell never mind we don‚Äôt need to get it‚Äù. I got annoyed because he always does this rolled my eyes and left the car without saying anything (likely closed the door a little hard but not slamming it) and started getting the groceries out of the trunk. 

He got out slammed his door and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre always such a bitch to me‚Äù and I again said I thought you can look at it and come back, if we want it we can get the truck out and go back together. 

He‚Äôs now giving the cold shoulder and I can‚Äôt stop crying. I really don‚Äôt think it was wrong to ask him to go look while I handle the other things, but I can‚Äôt stop thinking what my role is in this. ",,,

However, I found out my ex and his gf just broke up through social media and I need someone to talk to about this. 

Last night I saw a few posts from his new gf saying my ex is kicking her out after she was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. Apparently he gave her three days to leave, turned off the electricity in their place so she would move out (paid for it to be shut off and then paid for it to be turned on after she left), stole some of her stuff, and tried to defame her to the people close to her. I'm not sure if any abuse took place before this, from the rest of her posts about their relationship she seemed happy. 

He threatened to kick me out multiple times and held my housing over my head almost daily, knowing I didn't have a safe place to go to. I feel really bad for her. I also feel like I could've done something to prevent this if I had just reached out and told her he's abusive.   ",,,

I‚Äôm used to walk on egg shells at home - kids can‚Äôt be too noisy or messy, we have to do what husband says or he gets angry, and if the kids don‚Äôt show him affection (hugs, say hi, talk to him when HE wants it) then he gets angry, takes away rights (phone, tv, toys) or gives the silent treatment/ignore them.

1jcqowk,Bf wants me to be friends with his ex to sabotage her,Professional-Mood297,0,2025-03-16 17:28:02+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcqowk/bf_wants_me_to_be_friends_with_his_ex_to_sabotage/,"So I (20F) helped my bfs (23M) ex into rehab at the beginning of this year. And while I did it because I didn't want this girl to get trafficked (she came close to being trafficked), and I didn't want her dying... I don't want to be her friend. And important context, she is his parents' next door neighbor so you can see her car if you're over there. And he asked me to literally be friends with her and he wants me to fuck up her life from the inside. And I asked him how the hell I would even do that, and what he was on about. He told me that he wants me to convince her to get behind the wheel while really drunk. And that he hates seeing that car, and a big reason he was talking to her while we were on break was because he loved her car, and it's supposed to be his (even though her mom bought it for her) And it annoyed the hell outta me, because you mean you put me through all that stress not only for an ex, but for a CAR. He has a nice convertible already, I really don't get it??? 

This could all be an effed up joke, but it's wild to say in the first place. But I really don't know if he was being serious or not. 

Also this all started because she called him from a textnow number and started saying that he was holding the rehab thing over her head, and that triggered him. And that she thought him and his brother was following her, which he claims isn't true, they were just leaving at the same time. And I know he went to go play basketball with his friends so idk. ",,,

1jcp1nz,Controlling behavior escalated to something physical,hiss_terical,1,2025-03-16 16:16:44+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcp1nz/controlling_behavior_escalated_to_something/,"My husband and I have been together for a long time. Things were worse in the beginning when we both were heavy drinkers, but we both quit and things got better. I used to have to lock him out of a bedroom because he would follow me around screaming at me. Recently, he's been pushing me to work more and I'm also going to school. I am busy a stupid number of hours a week...60+ between school and work. He wanted me to go back to school, but then started complaining because I'm not doing enough housework and not being intimate with him, both emotionally and physically. It feels like the goal posts are always changing and more and more and more is being demanded of me, no matter how much I'm already doing. I'm exhausted. Burnt out. 

We got into a fight and I left to cool down and pick up my meds from the pharmacy. I got a nasty ""where the fuck do you think you're going?"" text, and then he decided to leave to go out drinking. When finally came home hours later, he demanded to see my phone, accusing me of cheating on him because I left. He woke me up screaming at me, and then fought me for my phone, wrestling it away from me. The kids heard it all. I took the kids and left. I haven't been back. 

He's begging to reconcile, and some part of me wants to believe it was only the alcohol that caused  the violence, but even before that our relationship had many issues. I don't know if there's any way for this to get better. And I can't stomach the thought of living with him again, or normalizing this behavior for our children. Or putting in more work and effort when I'm already so exhausted. Everything he texts me about is pushing to meet up, talking about how hard this is on him, and I still feel like I'm getting no consideration. He's being extra nice, but it feels fake. I feel like he just wants me back in the house with the kids, and nothing else (my feelings, my trauma, my happiness, the kids' wellbeing) matters as long as he can return to normal.

I just don't know where to go from here. I mean, I know, but I'm having a hard time. I feel like I'm stuck in limbo. I guess I just wanted to make a post in a space where people would understand. Thanks for listening. ",,,
1jcp076,Extreme guilt after a 12 hour standoff,Zestyclose-Skirt1583,2,2025-03-16 16:15:00+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcp076/extreme_guilt_after_a_12_hour_standoff/,"Tldr. Ex was sent back from work yesterday and I didn't realize how drunk he was before leaving, as he usually leaves when I come home from work. He came back from work after being sent home, and our car was messed up because he had ran over a mailbox. He came back crying and I immediately knew something was wrong.  

He had stopped for another beer and had it cracked open. He was crying and freaking out and I tried to calm him down and get him inside to drink water and sleep it off. But he immediately turned angry when he got out of the car and his screaming alerted a neighbor. Well, the neighbor watched and waited to intervene until she saw him swing on me. He hit me twice and I feel like I egged him on because I told him to back up and not do it because his probation would be screwed. He was on probation for strangulation and assault where we cut off complete communication until he was solidly in therapy and attending classes. 

Well, he fled. It was dark and we live out in a very rural area. The state police searched for an hour with two people before leaving. 

He came inside and a camera caught him so the police were called again. A very unprofessional officer told me I could be charged with aiding and abetting (? Correct spelling) if I didn't call and he showed up. I proceeded to explain I didn't know what kind of mood he was in and I wouldn't be able to call them if he simply shows up and dude rolled his eyes. The second time, they showed up with four-five state police officers, only one was a woman. They left after two hours.

The third time they showed up,  he fled somewhere new. I wanted this to be over because it was around four in the morning and I didn't want our little one to wake up (she's 3). I communicated with police that I would throw a blanket and hoodie outside for him and where he would be and they didn't catch him then. The same officer that threatened me with a charge on the last visit then demanded that I quit playing games and tell them where he went. Again, I didn't know. I had an inkling of an idea, but they were searching the few streets around here and not the woods like I'd said. 

The last final time he was caught inside, hiding in a crawlspace in our house. He came back to say goodbye to our daughter and apologized for his actions even though  üíØ know he would do it again. 

The same officer was there and I can't remember the last stupid comment he made, but I finally threatened to file a complaint. It took them 45 minutes to get here from one town over (a 20 minute drive). He apparently was the Sargeant. 

I just feel insanely guilty and depressed. I was on the phone with him for 6 hours that night, and he wouldn't tell me where he was, but I wanted to listen to see if or when he'd be caught and he wanted to talk about things we had repressed during prior arguments. He hasn't called from jail yet, and I feel like I'm going through the motions but not really here. I'm taking care of my daughter but not myself, and now have to worry about daycare and a new vehicle... And I feel horrible and I miss him and I know I shouldn't.  I just keep remembering how awful it felt to be on the phone with him, just waiting like that and our last hug and I know he wouldn't be violent towards our kid ever, but now I'm fucked up inside because he'll be in there 4 years if not longer with new charges.

1jcogvv,Am I being abused,,1,2025-03-16 15:51:28+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcogvv/am_i_being_abused/,"I didn‚Äôt know what to title this post because it‚Äôs a lot and I will probably end up deleting..

My fiance (27M) and I (25F) have been together for about 7 years, since our late teens. In that time, we have had some very crazy insane arguments. Currently now in our mid to late 20s, nothing is really wrong. But fianc√© cannot stop bringing up the past to rehash and yell and belittle me over.

For the first few years of our relationship, I was very bad at communicating. I invalidated, and I name called, I escalated arguments, I did it all. He spent years calling it out to me and ‚Äúbeating it‚Äù into my brain so that I would stop these behaviors. And for the most part (aside from the random attitude or eye roll) I have stopped. And I‚Äôm thankful that he was consistent with me and helped me change , and I tell him this. He also uses this against me quite often currently, to make me feel exactly how you would think. Another situation that gets brought up often is when (3? Years ago I think) I texted a male coworker to play a video game together: flirting. Nothing more happened but that did betray his trust. When caught, I started an argument and name called. I admit to this every time he brings it up and apologize. He also was texting someone (6 Years ago) and had a plan to go over to their house for sex, but I‚Äôm not allowed to ‚Äúuse that against him‚Äù because when I caught him, he admitted it immediately and apologized. There‚Äôs a whole lot more that I can‚Äôt add in or this would be way too long. Things like him organizing and me having trouble keeping it clean (I‚Äôm the only one working) - this an excuse to yell at me. Me not being psychically affectionate enough (I‚Äôve validated and I‚Äôm working on it). He says that he‚Äôs the reason our daughter is so considerate and the way she is and if left to me, she would be- fill in the blank with anything bad. If I even come inside the house and he perceives I have an attitude and I don‚Äôt get rid of it- argument. He has anger issues and punches things, yells at me, gets in my face, calls me names, these outbursts lasts for hours. While this is happening, I‚Äôm usually bawling my eyes out, listening, apologizing, telling him all the ways I will make up for it and make his life amazing. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. Last night he admitted he‚Äôs been having dreams of punching or choking me out and he can feel that it‚Äôs my fault. I‚Äôm nervous to even post this because what if he sees. And like I said, nothing new is happening because I‚Äôm a better partner now, but he has trauma. And I don‚Äôt know how to help I‚Äôm through it. He says if I just put a lens on where I enrich his life and he‚Äôs always at the front of my brain , maybe that will help. Honestly I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm even posting this, I just feel so helpless and hopeless right now. Does anyone have advice?",,,
1jcntmi,I left last night with my baby,CampApprehensive2213,28,2025-03-16 15:22:28+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcntmi/i_left_last_night_with_my_baby/,"I posted a while ago. Things were great again until they weren‚Äôt. 

He was wonderful for the rest of my pregnancy. Wonderful with our son.  I have so many photos of them together that now hurt to look at. 

The last two weeks have been horrendous. I actually thought his cruelty was caused by alcohol‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs been sober for about nine months. Having a baby was extremely motivating to stay on the straight and narrow. But time passed, he got stressed, and he got so unkind. 

He was yelling and screaming at me all day yesterday in front of our baby.  I‚Äôve never felt so defeated. He bought alcohol for the first time in the evening and I only figured it out about an hour after he got home and screamed some more. 

I recorded it all and I finally tore the bandaid off and sent one of the videos to a friend who convinced me to leave. 

Last time he bent my hand back and hurt me. I was pregnant. This time I didn‚Äôt stick around long enough for him to touch me. 

I feel so so bad for taking my baby away from his father. He loves his baby. 

The whole thing was humiliating. I was in a hotel lobby crying with a screaming baby going through all my bags looking for my credit card. My phone was blowing up and I was trying not to look. 

Then we get to our room and baby is inconsolable for about twenty minutes. I‚Äôm crying. I‚Äôm FaceTiming a friend whos also crying. Now this morning I can hear all the noises in the hotel and I know how thin the walls are and I‚Äôm just so mortified. 

I know it‚Äôs for the best but it feels so bad. I‚Äôm so scared he‚Äôs going to hurt himself. 

This is all his fault and he ruined everything with his actions but I feel like I‚Äôm the one who ripped our family apart and I can‚Äôt ever go back",,,

Our fights often includes him threatening to leave (I play into it and always end up stopping him- and when I admitted in a couples therapy session that sometimes I'm so tired that I think about letting him go, and he got mad and brought that up at a later fight (like bro- wtf)), but recently in lieu of that, he shouted he no longer wanted to do couples counseling and told me to cancel the appointment. Our relationship was always a bit rocky due to family issues but it seemed to really get bad in the past year or two.

Currently, we are almost a week in on him giving me the silent treatment, which is not super unusual when he gets mad but will often put it aside for household comments (bills, groceries, etc.). But the other day I mentioned something about groceries and he snapped at me, 'don't talk to me, text me if you need to.' The silent treatment escalated to straight up hostilely ignoring me, and this AM I told him morning, and asked how he was feeling, and he snapped again about texting him and not talking to him. I hear him talking to the cat and he's normal and sweet. He just texted me that this is how it's gonna be until further notice and to communicate only through text and that if I can't respect this boundary to let him know.

I know my normal meter is fucked up because of my own trauma and family issues (which is something I'm fixing with therapy, but my SO is impeding it a bit because I need to talk about us) but yeah... In all ways I feel like I've been set up to fail, feel no support and so weak, and I'm so sad.",,,

I told them to delete them and report it, but I had to explain to multiple friends what was going on, it‚Äôs stupid for him to get to me through my friends, they shouldn't have to worry about that and quite frankly I never wanted to discuss this with anyone again but since it's out there, I could really use some advice. I'd rather just forget it, but now I can't because he's making it everyone's business and messing up my social life. 

This is why I never post on social media and make my life very private. It took me hours to explain what was going on and it was humiliating, he forced my hand yet again and I'm still playing his games. I can barely do anything about it. I'm out of my mind. I don't know what to do. This has happened multiple times, but this time he is going after my friends. 

He has it set to a picture he took from me as well. I let my guard down and this happens. I'm at my wits end. I can't do it anymore. 

It's worth mentioning, on February 19, he harassed me and pretended to be someone else, I told him I couldn't do this and left him hanging. Then he made an account (different from this one) to send a long apology saying he never wanted to force me to engage with him, that he loves me, that I deserve better, and that I should block him after reading it. I ignored it. But instead of respecting his own words, he came right back to contact me again. That's the level of ""respect"" he has for me.

Thank you Reddit. Appreciate it in advance.",,,
1jcka3t,I just need to vent‚Ä¶,Fit-Luck69,4,2025-03-16 12:23:18+00:00,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcka3t/i_just_need_to_vent/,"TW - Emotional abuse, drug addiction, gaslighting


Hi, 

Im sorry if this comes off as poorly written, I am emotional. didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge what I may be going through and I didn‚Äôt want to post here because it solidifies what my fear is. 

I think I am being abused. I suffered from abuse my childhood, my school life and in a few relationships as well. 

I thought I escaped it all. I told myself after my second last ex I‚Äôd never be abused again. What has happened now? I am with someone (who mind you, doesn‚Äôt even want to make it official yet) who just treats me like absolute fucking shit 90% of the time. 

I spoke to him for months and now have moved to another state to be with him. We spend basically everyday together for the last 4 months. 

He is just so disrespectful. He constantly critiques everything I do, constantly puts me down, blurts out completely rude insults/word vomit, lashes out on me, blames me for everything wrong, gaslights me when I tell him I‚Äôm upset and downplays it - then blames me, barely apologises, refuses to have any emotional conversations with me - I try to set boundaries and I‚Äôm a ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù or he stonewalls me, he doesn‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm sad, he constantly is being defiant towards me and the list just go on and on‚Ä¶

He is a drug addict to one of the hardest drugs. I consistently blame the addiction on the way he treats me. I justify it to myself his actions because of his adhd, autism and addiction. He downplays me so much and says he‚Äôs ‚Äújust joking‚Äù when he hurts me and that I‚Äôm too sensitive. I‚Äôm constantly apologising for lashing out back. When I speak politely asking not to treat me like that, it doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve started lashing out a lot because he won‚Äôt listen when I try to communicate kindly and maturely. 

He takes advantage of my kindness. I do everything for him. I have a full time job and he doesn‚Äôt work. I clean, I make him food or buy him food, I drive to places to get him stuff without him in the car. 

The guy doesn‚Äôt even like hugging or kissing me, he spends days awake playing games while I‚Äôm alone in bed. Not to mention he‚Äôs never touched me sexually - only me giving to him. He has a reason for this and I respect it. But still‚Ä¶ sucks feeling so rejected often. He also doesn‚Äôt compliment me, never has called me pretty or beautiful. Closes is when I ask him if I look pretty or good and he says ‚Äúyeah‚Äù very bluntly. 

The thing is, I‚Äôve seen his good side when he was sober. He never love bombed me. When he‚Äôs sober he genuinely is so much better. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just the drugs or him in general. 

Why the fk do I allow myself to be treated like this? I‚Äôm too much of a coward to leave and be by myself. I‚Äôm constantly trying to improve myself mentally through therapy, groups, reading up, working on myself. 

I also sacrificed so much for him. I moved far away for him, I had cosmetic work done on myself to impress him (he never asked btw I just wanted to be perfect for him) I try so hard. 

I honestly feel so pathetic for staying. I feel pathetic that I can‚Äôt see a way out and I just hold on to hope that when he‚Äôs sober he‚Äôs better. I genuinely feel like I have no respect for myself and I feel so damn alone. I don‚Äôt tell anybody because it‚Äôs embarassing. I don‚Äôt want to tell people because it means it‚Äôs true. If he just showed that sensitive side he showed before when he was sober it would be all I need. I don‚Äôt ask for material items, I don‚Äôt ask for much honestly. He acts like showing me affection is an inconvenience. 

I just don‚Äôt understand how somebody can treat someone else like this. I feel like a shell of a person,  I just want to be loved. If I leave him I have nothing left. I‚Äôm stuck in this state until my lease ends at least and that‚Äôs not for awhile. I‚Äôd have nobody. I don‚Äôt want to leave him because I do love him so deeply. But I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm being mistreated. 

And it‚Äôs crazy because I am so educated on abuse, and yet I make excuses. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm turning a blind eye on it because of hope. 

I think I hold on too because he doesn‚Äôt show other typical sings. Like love bombing, jealousy or controlling behaviour. 

I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on anybody. I pray everyday that things will improve and I know my situation is nothing compared to others and I look like a fkn fool for staying. I know I‚Äôll get shat on because it is my fault honestly. I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a victim or ‚Äúpity me‚Äù but I‚Äôm being completely raw and transparent right now.  

I don‚Äôt know what the point of posting is since I don‚Äôt want to be told to leave him. I would like some success stories with people improving but we wouldn‚Äôt be on this subreddit if that was the case, plus I don‚Äôt want other people to get false hope in abusive situations either because that‚Äôs harmful. 

I have so much compassion and love for everybody else but myself. I am trying so hard to love myself and I just can‚Äôt. Never in my life. No matter what I‚Äôve done. 

I hope there‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel. I just want to be loved unconditionally with the same energy I give to them. I feel not good enough and like a waste of space. I sabotaged my life by moving here and staying with him after I saw the red flags. I knew and know better. ",,,
1jck1hn,Trying to figure out if I'm in an abusive relationship.,crystalH0908,3,2025-03-16 12:08:49+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jck1hn/trying_to_figure_out_if_im_in_an_abusive/,"Ever since I first started dating my partner I feel like I've been slowly trying to be controlled and made to change. In the very beginning of the relationship my partner tried and succeeded to fast track the relationship. Which went against everything I believed in because of how my 14yr marriage with children ended. I always take things slow, I like to be friends first with a person I date first. I'm very old school in this department and have dated few men in my life, so far, and a couple of people for months and I never even became intimate with them(in any way) because it just never felt right or happened. My partner wanted me to give over all of my emotions and to act as if we had been dating for months, even though it had only been 2-3 weeks into the relationship and when I didn't that's when he began to tell me that there was something wrong with me. That I was emotionless, had no feelings. I was like a robot for being wary and wanting to taking things slow and get to know him better before I just gave over my heart and all the benefits and actions/behaviors that go with that. He told me that I should be texting him like every hour or so, with stuff like ""I'm thinking of you,"" or ""I miss you,"" and when I didn't or argued that what he was asking was a bit much and didn't seem reasonable. He would once again proceed to tell me that I'm the one who wasn't thinking correctly if I didn't agree with him and that something was wrong with me for not thinking like him. He would have expectations of me and want certain courtesies and behaviors from me that he, himself, wouldn't do, or think he shouldn't be required to have the same expectations or behaviors and this theme has continued through the entirety of our relationship, so far. Whenever we argued it was always me who's wrong and if he was ever wrong it could never be just his fault. It would also have to be partly my fault or I made him react the way he does. He constantly tells me I'm lying, when he has no proof I have been. He will tell me that I'm lying about things I'm thinking and feeling when there's no way he can even prove such things and will insist he's right even when I tell him what he's saying is incorrect. He constantly finds things about me to be upset with or to find fault with, even when everything is going fine, especially when everything is fine. Goes into my phone behind my back. Not that I care I have nothing to hide but will get worked up and anxious if I mention going into his phone like he has mine and will say only if he's there right next to me and can dictate what I can look at. He has put his hands on me 3 times. He's never punched or slapped me but the first time he forced me to kiss him, after an argument when he was leaving and I didn't want to and I was pulling my head away from him and out of his hands. Then he grabbed my head and forced me to look up while he forcefully kissed me and even hurt my mouth with how hard he did it. The 2nd time was in the car, and I told him to drop me at my place and that he wasn't to come in because we were arguing. When we got to my place and I tried to get out he gripped my jacket with both hands to point it was cutting into my arm and wouldn't allow me to get out of the car. I repeatedly tried to get out of his grip and out of the car for about 10 minutes before I slumped over and started crying because I realized I was helpless to do anything. Which reminded me of my very violent first marriage. My ex-husband put me in the hospital, raped me, and almost took my life and my partner knows this. So when he did what he did in the car it took me back to that horrible time in my life and I felt ashamed for feeling like I was back in the same situation. He finally let me out of the car and then proceeded to taunt me about not seeing any tears even though there's no way he could because I put my sunglasses on because mascara was all over, under my eyes, from crying so hard. Once I got to my apartment door I tried to shut the door on him but he slammed his foot in the doorway and I ended up just letting him in because I didn't want to make a scene with my neighbors right there. The 3rd time we were in bed and he hit me in the back with his vape because he thought I fell asleep smoking a cigarette in bed, which I hadn't. My back was to him and he couldn't see my face. When I addressed these situations with him, after they happened. He would tell me I was lying about how I felt and what I was thinking when he did what he did. Would say I was over exaggerating what occurred and that I was lying about him physically hurting me. To this day he sees nothing wrong with what he did in those situations. Even though he knows what happened to me in my past. I'm going to stop here for now. There is more stuff but he'll be getting up soon. Some feedback would be great because as he sees it and keeps telling me it's me that's the entire problem in the relationship. He's been relentless about calling me a narcissist, insisting that I am one that needs therapy, and that he read about the signs of a narcissist and that I have them. He even admitted joining a Reddit thread about narcissistic partners/spouses and when I asked what my signs were the only thing he's ever told me is that I get quite when we argue and I stop talking or I just refuse to interact. I've told him that is I coping mechanism I developed from the relationship with my physical/mentally abusive ex-husband because the more I tried to fight back, explain myself, stand up for myself. The worse the beatings were and he knows this. Again any insight would be helpful and thanks in advance.",,,

1jcixz5,"I left... I should be happy, why does it hurt so bad?",aervin98,3,2025-03-16 10:55:41+00:00,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcixz5/i_left_i_should_be_happy_why_does_it_hurt_so_bad/,"TL;DR - basically, the title. 

It is 5:37am and I have what's left of my basic necessities (plus a few of my ""wants"") in the car with me. I say ""the rest of"" because I had moved out over 2 weeks ago after I was called a ""lazy PoS"" for the last time... my aunt and uncle offered me a place to stay for a few months and I've been staying there. I am in a parking lot now because I don't want to disturb my aunt and uncle so early, and I was staying at her house after a show just to have a place to sleep. I was on the couch, and it erupted into a fight more than once.. it escalated so quickly... so I left, except for a few occasions, for good... 

I do feel a sense of relief.. i keep to myself in my new home. I enjoy the peace and quiet. My aunt and uncle bicker, but it doesnt bother me. It's not my issue, and it's so nice to be in a place where everything isn't my fault and I'm punished for it. 

However... this is the most heartache and pain I have ever felt.. I cannot provide my dog a good home so she's keeping her. I can see her whenever, but that means going back, and that hurts in multiple areas. When i travel, i will tske my dog to my gigs, but then i have to take her back until I can get my own place... I've gone back several times to help wjere I felt responsible, and every time what started as help turned into an expectation and then the cycle started again and I would leave again and ust reopen all the wounds that can't hea - due to my inablility to cut contact completely because I feel compelled, to a fault, to do the right thing... it is a blessing and a curse..

This hurts so much.. Overall, I am okay. Not wanting to ""end it"" at all, so to speak. Haven't even thought of it. No harm has been done to myself (which used to be an issue). In this sense, I am extremely proud of how strong I have been, but there is deep, deep presence of pain and hopelessness... When I invisioned leaving, pain was never in the equation, but it seems to be a majority of what I'm feeling. I don't understand..

Why does something that is ultimately *extremely* positive for myself so painful... ",,,

I have a pattern of falling for the wrong guy, trying to fix people, and prioritizing others over myself. Recognizing this was one thing, but breaking out of the cycle was another. A year ago, I was too broke to get therapy, so I started reading self-help books and made a list of the qualities and values my future partner must have. I took time for myself and reflected on my own unhealthy patterns. I really want children someday, but I don‚Äôt want to raise them alone.  

In September, I slowly started dating again. But this time, I thought more about who my future children would have to call their father rather than what I found exciting. In December, I met a guy I wouldn‚Äôt normally go for, someone I initially thought was boring. But he matched my list perfectly. I kept seeing him, and he turned out to be the kindest man I have ever dated. After two months, I started to develop real feelings for him.  

I promise it‚Äôs worth it. I feel so safe with him, but I am also my own person. I don‚Äôt have to carefully choose my words, we just talk.  

Please give the ""boring"" guy a chance. He feels boring because he doesn‚Äôt stress you out.",,,

I (36f) have been dating my boyfriend (35m) for about a year. We live together. 
The whole month of February I‚Äôve been feeling like I have the worst PMS, kept feeling like my period was going to start.

My boyfriend went on a two week work trip across the country. The day he left, I started my period but the cramps and bleeding were so much worse than normal. I felt suicidal. I told him I had to end things with him because I was afraid he was drinking again on his trip (he is about 7.5 months sober) and that I was going to the hospital because of my suicidal ideation. He didn‚Äôt respond to my messages.

At the emergency room, the doctor told me I had tested positive for pregnancy and was having a chemical pregnancy miscarriage. They gave me an ultrasound to make sure it wasn‚Äôt ectopic and then sent me home. I am devastated. 

I had a stillbirth with my exhusband over a decade ago and this brought up all the pain from that. I had mostly given up on being a mother because of the scarring and fluid in my fallopian tubes, so getting pregnant this was unexpected. One of my early signs of pregnancy is suicidal thoughts and mood swings; this happened during my first pregnancy as well.

I messaged him when I got home from the hospital apologizing for my hormonal mood swing/suicidal thoughts and for being paranoid that he was drinking. I asked him to please call me. He didn‚Äôt respond. I called him and he didn‚Äôt respond. I poured my heart out over texts about what happened and asked him to please call me. I called his voicemail and cried, begging him to talk to me. It has been five days and he has completely ghosted me. I understand if he needs time to process what happened, but I wish he would have communicated that to me instead of ghosting me. 

I‚Äôm not only losing the pregnancy, but losing him. Just a few weeks ago he held me in his arms and told me he wanted to start a family with me.
He gets back from his work trip on the 22nd. I was supposed to pick him up from the airport, but I guess I won‚Äôt be now. 

All his belongings are in my home, including important ones like his car, the title to the house he is renovating, his desktop computer‚Ä¶ I wonder if he will come gather his possessions himself or continue to be a coward and send his parents.

I feel devastated. I thought he loved me and I believed all his promises for our future. I know he is ghosting me and not hurt in an accident or something because he is still active on social media. The pregnancy hormones are fading and I‚Äôm feeling more like myself. I will go all day keeping my mind off of the miscarriage then feel like I can barely breathe when a wave of grief hits me. 
It is hardest at bedtime. I have never felt this alone. 

My last message to him was: You wanna know what hurts more than losing a pregnancy? Being abandoned by the man I loved while I went through it.

This is one of the cruelest things anyone has ever done to me. There were times were I would see a mean side to him and I always worried that he was love bombing me or using me. I should have listened to my gut because he flipped his love off so quickly, I doubt he ever loved me at all. I keep wondering what I did wrong to make him abandon me when I lost his child. How can he hate me so much to be silent when I need him most? His mask has finally come off and I see that he is cold and cruel.

I am worried.",Usual-Ad-9740,24,2025-03-16 02:16:46+00:00,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcbczy/he_almost_killed_her_last_mothers_day_today_shes/,"Last year in May my co worker, and also friend was strangled by her baby daddy. She told me they got into an argument because he liked some girls picture on instagram, and they started to argue. So he choked her out while their 2 kids were sleeping, left her unconscious in their apartment, stole her car, and left her for dead. She told me the only time he doesn‚Äôt put his hands on her is when she‚Äôs pregnant. üòï 

I actually didn‚Äôt know this was a normal thing for her then I remembered actually seeing her with a busted lip before but she blamed it on her toddler son. There was another incident when he showed up to our job, and was looking for her and she was hiding from him. Anyways, after he almost killed her on Mother‚Äôs Day I told her to leave him because he could‚Äôve killed her, and left their kids without a mother. Honestly, I believe he was trying to kill her. He didn‚Äôt stop until she lost consciousness that sounds exactly like attempted murder to me. Eventually he won her back by I guess love bombing her, and buying her stuff to get her back. It‚Äôs literally a cycle. Im still very concerned for her well being because she‚Äôs having another baby by this abuser, and I fear he will continue to abuse her. I truly believe he only continues to get her pregnant to keep her stuck, and unable to leave. She has told me before she would struggle really bad without him. I am worried one day he will kill her, and leave their kids without a mother. I tried to give her solutions. I even told her we could go in on an apartment together because she deserves so much better. But I know trying to get her to leave will only result in me getting cut off as a friend and I do genuinely care about her. My old best friend is in a similar situation and cut me off because I tried to get her to leave her abuser. 


Anyways, just wanted to vent about the situation close to me. I hope her, and the babies are safe everyday. They don‚Äôt deserve to be without a mother, and I‚Äôm worried about what they‚Äôre exposed to with a man like this around. If that man strangles you, and hits you he will kill you. Nobody can ever convince me otherwise. ",,,

It's almost 3 years since, we have married. He started threatening me right before our wedding (because of my cold feet).. and right from our wedding night I, was just his possession.. His parents come first, his siblings next, his business, then us (according to him). He literally fake cried during my delivery and was tormenting me for giving birth to our daughter.. Hiding that he gets cold sores and passing it to me when, I was a new mom (still gaslighting even though, he admitted it to derm).. Now, I suffer from frequent Hsv1 and OCD..


 we live extremely near his parents and would complain about me to them.. They also enjoy hearing about my faults (Both FIL and MIL).. This family hasn't treated even one of us (including my co-sister and co-brother) nicely.. They shame us publicly and privately.. My husband has slapped me multiple times infront of our toddler and has abused me both privately and publicly.. He is extremely nice to my family even, has helped my father with his business and provided financial aid. Which my family has repaid half the amount.. FIL even had the audacity to re-hire an employee who, my father has fired.. Even if I wanted a divorce, my family has no support to offer.  I'm shit scared of him.. I don't know whether to expect his good or bad side.. he is extremely loving to his nephews and nieces but, only rarely graces his loving side to my daughter.. I can't ask anything,  speak, or go to work.. He even accused me of talking my lover infront, of his relatives (I was sending a birthday wish to a female friend which,  I told him while typing the message).. My daughter loves him and his family though.. Maybe when she grows up.. I want a happy marriage.. He won't come for counseling/ normal talk with me.. I often see him, providing interest free loan to his company's staff. So, that they won't leave him.. he rarely provides for us and my father supports us (be it medicine,  milk. Groceries, etc).. 


I also feel sorry for him. He is hardworking and doesn't come from a good household.. His father nearly killed him while, dunking him in water when he was about 8 months for more than 5 times (just for irritating him). I dread waking up next day in this household.

Today after I saw him flirting with random girls at the store we went to, I was feeling a bit irritated. We go to a local market for groceries and someone asked if we were married. I said that we weren‚Äôt, and they proceeded to ask if we were engaged. Sometimes since I‚Äôm shy, I get a little bit uncomfortable and don‚Äôt know how to answer, since technically we are not engaged since I was never given a ring. I guess I was a bit brash and said ‚Äúmentally we are.‚Äù Which I know was kind of mean maybe, but what I meant was that we aren‚Äôt formally engaged. In front of everyone, he told me to go f*** myself. I really didn‚Äôt want to drive home with him (he has full control of my car), because I knew that he was going to drive recklessly. It was worse than I expected. I was sure we would get pulled over- scratch that I was PRAYING we would, because it was so scary. He then said, ‚Äúf*** you, I will marry a b***h on the corner.‚Äù He had said things like this before, and I often feel like saying, ‚Äòokay, if that is what you want then do that.‚Äô 
We sharply cut down a tiny alley going 65 miles an hour. As we flew out onto a street my brand new tire blew out. Of course he blamed it on me and said it was my fault and this is what happens when you are disrespectful.

At one point I started to cry and he tried to keep going but it took me actually crying a bit for him to stop. He also would just force it in and used his hand to open my mouth. I tried having a discussion with him about it today and he says it was ""CNC"" but there was no discussion about it beforehand (we've talked about ""no limits"" days but that was months ago, we had no agreement to do it last night), no discussion of safewords, and he didnt do aftercare. I have a lot of evidence against him including him saying ""you kept going"" after i told him it wasnt consensual when I was saying no/stop/i dont want to, and then I said because he was forcing it and he said ""thats what facefucking is"". I also have the condom and havent showered yet so I could get a rape kit done, but I feel conflicted about it. He also made me puke on it when I said I didn't want to. This isn't the first time he has done this with me/crossed my boundaries/not respected the word ""no"". But last night was bad. 

I'm just conflicted about whether I am overreacting or not and should press charges. He is my FWB and we aren't exclusive. He treats me like shit. But I don't want to hurt him how he hurt me? Part of me still likes him and wants to see him again? It's so confusing. But I'm hurt and dissociated and sad after last night. After I told him I didn't feel good about last night and it wasn't consensual he said I should come over to his tonight so he can use all my holes. 

Any advice appreciated. ",,,

She constantly stressed me saying ""your dad is going to cheat one me"" like ALL the time. ""You promise you will let me have full custody? Tell them that in court! Imagine some other woman trying to raise you as their son!"" My dad was never able to go to beach on holidays when we went, even with his own side of the family... bc ""he will look at naked girls"" aka girls in swimsuits, bc... it's THE FUCKING BEACH). 

My dad's parents were my saving grace, every weekend and most weeks I didn't have school I stayed with them (just 15 min away) and I didn't have to hear arguing and throwing stuff all the time. Well when I was 10/11 they bought me a small four wheeler (and helmet!) And my mom FLIPPED THE FUCK OUT, would no longer let me go over there and cussed them out. She would leave voicemails to them saying they are evil people. She would always tell me it's just me and her and that my dad would eventually leave. The stress was so bad I had a few Grey hair by 12 years old, at one point for a year or two thought I had chrons disease bc her cousin has it and my stomach was ALWAYS torn up. First day of kindegarden I shit myself and cried for my mommy. She even wiped me until I was like 7/8/9.

When I was in 4th grade I wrote a note to this girl's friend that I liked her friend and told her she was ""hot"". After a response it ended back up in my bag and my mom found it. She raised hell told me I'm a nasty slut for liking girls so young, (I was  a 10/11 year old boy) and that I was not allowed to look at, talk to , or especially not date ANYONE until I was 16, preferably 17. 

I wasn't allowed to have social media but downloaded it and hid it at night lol.  She never would go out with me and my dad but maybe once a year, bc she had to put on 4/5 hours worth of makeup (expensive) makeup. (She paid bills with my dad's money and we almost lost the house bc she was using the money on her make up, even tho she didn't go anywhere except the store and doctor to get her oxycontin (since I was 5 her hysterectomy ""went wrong"" and she needed 100smg of oxy a day plus zoloft and lorazepam)

She would take them all and go doctor hopping so my dad would put them in his car to take to work so she would only have what she needed that day. Well even at 11/12 I was ""too young"" to stay home by myself! So she would take me with her to break into his car (smash window/etc) to get it. Shit triggered a panic disorder in me.

This was around 13, she started going out with her extended family more. Turns out, she started cheating with her cousin, and left my dad. Never even had a custody thing bc she had no money for a lawyer and I didn't want to stay with a cheating, jobless, psychotic whore anyway. 

My dad finally started giving me freedom I never had, he would go out on weekend my my grandma would watch me or I'd be home alone. Around this time I got into weed. The bullying at school was easier when I had a good smoke to come home and look forward to.

Well by the time I'm 14 he starts dating this ugly,  2 pack a day cigarette christian-fascist woman with 2 kids. Within 6 months she burned her house down and moved in with us. She started setting new rules my dad didn't have, like I can't close my door with my gf in there (my dad didn't care as long as I used protection) but he said I needed to listen to her. She said I would burn in hell forever if I had sex before marriage. I also walked into MY OWN HOUSE to her and my dad fucking as loud as possible in MY room with door open, they had been dating less than a year and weren't married.

At this point (15) I spent summer with my grandparents who let me and my gf close the door lol. Same way they used to do for my dad. ""Yall gonna do it regardless we just want ya to be safe""  around school time they bought a new house 5min away from my grandparents and wanted me there so ""we can be a family"" I said no take it to court (I was 16 now). And never turned back.

I developed BPD which led to opiate addiction, the girl I dated at 15 that my stepmom told me I couldn't have sex with lasted until 21, we had a house together at 17. It failed bc I had serious trust issues and even tried therapy at 16, but my grandma, bless her heart (she doesn't force religion on me) got me a Christian ""psychiatrist"" (religious idiots should not be allowed in medicine) that I just agreed with everything he said and he said ""he seems perfectly fine with me!"" And I never went back or got help. Eventually got into Gma pain pills and when kratom saved me from that at 17/18, my gf and I lived at my grandpa's old house below them.

After a few years down there, one of my best friends from kindergarten all thru high-school hangout for first time in years bc people said I was weird for only hanging out with my girlfriend (she was my bff 100%) so we hangout and decides to do some coke like we did in high-school. I did it and he said ""there's some heroin in it to ;) I ended up addict3d, destroyed my life, my gf got hooked, we broke up, I went to methadone clinic to get help and try to get right so we could get back together and methadone clinic gave me 200mg but you have to take it THERE, they don't give you take homes here. So I blacked out bc they gave me twice what I needed. 

Well, I killed someone and got 25 years in prison, suspended thankfully due to the fact IT WASNT MY FAULT I TRUSTED THE DOCTOR. And now here I am back at grandparents, who are Grey now and GPA prob has alzheimers:( with no friends, no girlfriend/bestfriend or even dates. My ex is getting married now.. I'm finally sober but I can't get her back, our old house sold and demolished to pay for legal fees. I think my time on earth  is almost over guys. I don't have a plan yet but it's coming :(",,,

That dark evil look that he has where I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on behind those eyes. I had a feeling the first night I was going to have sex whether I liked it or not. The look, that dark look told me I was right. I‚Äôm a bit older now, my body - especially my vagina, can‚Äôt handle the rough angry pawing of an abusive drunk man. I didn‚Äôt want sex. I went to sleep and woke up with it already in progress, his hands and mouth on me and in me. I disassociate and freeze when this happens. This is not consent. This was not love. This was him abusing me. The roughness, of course, caused some bleeding. I didn‚Äôt want to see it in my panties when I used the restroom, it‚Äôs traumatizing, so I had put a tampon in. I was shutting things out and shutting myself down. Disassociating. Feeling out of it. This happens a lot. One time 2 yrs ago it happened 3x in a week, not sure if 1 out of the 3 was anal, but I do remember he whispered something nasty in my ear as he got off of me that night. This time I did something I don‚Äôt normally do. I had wiped the bleeding away with a tissue. I threw it in the trash. The next morning, I picked it out of the trash and put it in a plastic bag. To remind myself? To say to myself, look - blood! Blood does not equal love! That night I put on a skims style body suit thing that goes to mid thigh, no holes or anything for my butt, you have to pull the whole thing down to use the restroom. On top of that, I put a sweater with very difficult to open buttons. The buttons are pearls and diamonds that snag and are cute but non functioning buttons, essentially. That‚Äôs what I went to sleep in. I have opened the buttons on that sweater like twice since I‚Äôve gotten it, bc they are difficult and it‚Äôs easier to throw over my head to put it on. That night I woke up because I was cold. I was naked. There was wetness. My knee was in a wet spot on the bed and my butt was wet and there were things being dripped onto my black side. My face was in the bed, and my butt was in the air. My knees were bent slightly spread. There was something in my asshole. I don‚Äôt know if it was his dick or fingers as I was in the process of waking up. I said no! Stop! And he grabbed me by the hips and pulled me back to him. I think the reason he went in my butt was because I had the tampon in. The tampon was in not bc of period, but due to his actions the night before which caused the bleeding in my vagina. So one night I get it vaginally, the next night I get it in the ass. I missed an event with the kids bc I got agitated and stressed and then I realized it was because I had lube coming out of my asshole. The first three images are what I wrote before he raped me vaginally. The second was after the anal rape the next night. He‚Äôs not having sex unbeknownst to himself in his sleep. His actions are deliberate. He knew and knows what he‚Äôs doing. I can look back and see that when this has happened before, that I was doing things for myself or better handling things emotionally. I thought I could suppress this one too. Only I couldn‚Äôt. The thought of giving his number to my surgeon‚Äôs office as someone to call in case of an emergency? I stuttered and started shaking. He had also told me it would make him happy if I died on the table during surgery. When I looked shocked and got up to leave he, of course as always, said it was a joke. It was just a joke. All the mean things he says to me, that‚Äôs just a joke or no he doesn‚Äôt remember saying that or flat out no he didn‚Äôt or he tries to change what he‚Äôs said. I‚Äôm in the process of trying to move out but y‚Äôall, there‚Äôs still that part of me that says the kids, it‚Äôs easier with kids to have two parents in the house. I work (according to him don‚Äôt contribute or do enough). I volunteer. I am shattered and can‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so hard to love me. I am broken and feel like emotionally I‚Äôm a burden to those around me and toxic. I live in a small-ish town, but I‚Äôve developed some friendships here and a small network here that I would have died without having. My health has suffered so much from this, to having a thyroid disease to a heart issue to debilitating allergies (celiac/dairy/nuts/etc). I don‚Äôt know what to do. My gp and psych say to make a police report and pursue criminal charges, but isn‚Äôt that for law & order svu? Ironically, it‚Äôs one of my favorite shows. He hates it and will not watch it/ allow me to because he says his ex wife used to watch it. Part of me wants to reach out and talk to her to see why they really got divorced. Did she experience this? I also found he has the Grindr app from august 2018 until it disappeared from my view (not necessarily ended, app could be hidden) May 2024. I don‚Äôt have money to afford the lifestyle, for that matter neither does he. I have two little ones here, and they are amazing and wonderful spirits that I can not believe I am blessed to be their mom. They are my little superstar heroes, they are so accomplished and do so many things and activities from sports to art to dance. I can‚Äôt let them down. I will not fail them. But I have, because I can‚Äôt give them all of me and who I am, all the good if me because my shine is so hidden by the walls I built to keep my heart beating and my lungs breathing. I tried to suppress it all and I crashed on my bike. Numb to the pain. I couldn‚Äôt cry. I couldn‚Äôt have an orgasm while masturbating. I used to be able to handle this and disassociate. I can not anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm running down a hill but I can‚Äôt control the direction. I‚Äôve been cleaning, that‚Äôs good. But I am so afraid I‚Äôm going to back slide and agree to stay with him. He‚Äôs the one who has screamed divorce at me hundreds of times. Now that I‚Äôve agreed (in November), he now doesn‚Äôt want to get divorced. I told him we are, I‚Äôm looking for a place yet he keeps sending me info on houses like it‚Äôs all normal, and that since he‚Äôs moved on from ‚Äúthe argument‚Äù I should just forgive him and move on too because why can‚Äôt I just forgive him. Don‚Äôt think there was one conversation about it, he doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it just wants me to ‚Äúforgive him and love him‚Äù. I need direction and strength, it‚Äôs hard to trust my thoughts because that‚Äôs how he‚Äôs made me be. My definition of love unto me is love=pain. I need strength to get through all of this. I need a lawyer and I don‚Äôt have money for one. I am lost but still need to lead, the kids and my coworkers. I am aware that I‚Äôll be pegged as the Xitch and bad guy in the divorce. I wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for letting me vent. No one knows the whole story of my marriage, it‚Äôs humiliating. Embarrassing. Traumatizing. Violating. Terrorizing. It‚Äôs so awful, silently I hate to see those happy people showing support and kind love to each other because I don‚Äôt know how that feels nor have I experienced that in a long time. I have a glimpse and a glimmer of hope now, but I don‚Äôt know what to trust anymore. He‚Äôs out of town until April, and I dread the return intensely. I have a quiet thought on repeat, when I‚Äôm making dinner or cleaning or breathing. It‚Äôs help me help me help me help me help me. I need to help myself but I‚Äôm so soul worn and broke tired of it all.

1jbxy01,I Think I Might be in Danger,ChewsFoodOnlyTwice,2,2025-03-15 15:43:54+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbxy01/i_think_i_might_be_in_danger/,"TW: Self harm 

Today is the first day in my life that I thought I was in serious danger by a romantic partner and I'm not exactly sure what to do. My partner has never physically abused me but I think he is trying to convince everyone around me that I'm suffering from severe postpartum depression, a danger to myself and our 6 month old. 

I'm not. I have struggled with suicidal ideation my whole life but since giving birth it has been non-existent. I suspect because I have a much stronger sense of self preservation now because my baby needs me. I have talked about this extensively with my therapist and mentioned it several times to my husband. 

We're going through a divorce. A contested divorce because he won't agree to a divorce. Last week he reported me to CPS for a whole bunch of stuff that were either straight up lies or not abuse at all (he told them that I keep threatening to get a divorce.. my divorce lawyer accompanied me and we all just kind of paused for a second..) one of the things he said was that I was suicidal. I told them that was absolutely not true. I have a whole team of medical professionals that I meet with regularly to make sure my medication is working and that I have emotional guidance. I have a therapist I meet with once a week. I have support groups. I released my therapy notes to them to prove that since I have given birth I have not expressed that I am a danger to myself or others. 

After the meeting, hearing the things he accused me of, and having explained what was actually happening (he is intimidating me into thinking that if I go through with the divorce I won't get custody) I was afraid of him in a whole new way. The accusations were wild. The idea that he would accuse me of abusing our child or worse for divorcing him (he reported me the same day I told him I was going through with the contested divorce) was terrifying. Those types of actions have real life repercussions. 

I went home to visit my family (my step dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer this week) and while I was talking about the DCS meeting my family members started telling me that he has been trying to convince them that I am suicidal and homicidal for months. He called my mom and told her he ""knows the signs"" (he doesn't.. he knows nothing about my mental health conditions because he doesn't like talking about it and he screams at me every time I try to talk about it) h told her that I'm in a dangerous place. She was obviously like ""No I know my daughter better than you and I know what she's experiencing right now and it's not that"" and he argued with her! Yelling at her to not ""downplay this"" because it's ""serious""! She ignored him and just shut the conversation down. Last weekend I left a family event crying because I was given the cold shoulder (gee I wonder why.. know now that he's been saying outlandish things about me) and he called my brother and my mom and gave them weird cryptic messages that hinted at the fact that I was in immediate danger. My brother showed up at my house before I got there. My mom called me frantic. It was ridiculous and I told them it was ridiculous. I was just normal person sad about a normal person sad event and I wanted to go home instead of being in a place I didn't feel welcome. 

I remembered this morning that he occasionally tries to tell me I have said some very very strange things in the past that I KNOW I haven't because I have never even had the thought or feeling related to them. He sold his car a few years ago to buy something and now he's trying to convince everyone I made him sell his car so that he ""couldn't leave me"". Which is absolutely ridiculous. I do not want to force someone to be with me and I'M THE ONE WHO IS TRYING TO LEAVE. 

I have been thinking about all this stuff for days because it doesn't make any sense to me. He doesn't want a divorce but says all these wild things about me. He doesn't work and that's part of why we're getting a divorce. He says I can't make him work and I say he can't force me to financially support him and I will divorce him if that is what it takes. So why would he be doing all this stuff? He needs me to keep a roof over his head. 


It occurred to me that when I was once hospitalized for suicidal thoughts (before I had the baby) they called him to ask him if he was comfortable with me going home. At the time, we joked about it because that's a potentially dangerous situation to put a woman in. I told him how once when I was hospitalized I met a woman who was running away from her abusive husband and he called the police and told them she had snapped and was a danger to herself. She was in there for over a month. She had to go to court and get a judge to order her removal. He did. 

It occurred to me today that it's possible he is trying to get me into a hospital for ""postpartum depression"". It would get me out of the house (that I own) and paychecks would keep coming in (from my job!) because I would be out on medical leave and he could idk. Use that to prove I'm an unfit mother in court? I don't even know what the end goal is. I don't know what's going on. But I'm afraid to go back home. ",,,

Just said he was going out. I did some things around the house then called (he didn't answer) and texted him to check in, asked if he'll be out for much longer. He didn't reply for about a half hour so I decided to go to a bar I like to have a drink, get out of the house. When I told him I was going out, he immediately jumps to accusing me of going to meet guys, saying ""Enjoy whoever you end up with wherever you're going,"" ""Enjoy whoever you meet wherever you're going,"" ""I'm sure you'll get the attention you're looking for,"" ""You'll pick up some [instagram] followers in the coming days I'm sure."" When I said he was being demeaning, he said ""You're being delusional."" For the couple hrs I was at the bar, I sat in the corner by myself,  writing in my journal and texting with him, trying to hold back tears. I was going to get a second drink, but didn't want to end up getting more emotional, so I went home. He texts me at 12:30 saying he'll be back soon. I went to sleep around 2:30 and he still wasn't back.
I cant stand to even look at him right now. He's going to justify every fucking thing he said and make it all my fault. Again. ",,,

1jbweba,I think I might have escaped an abusive relationship,Outrageous_Contest91,8,2025-03-15 14:32:47+00:00,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbweba/i_think_i_might_have_escaped_an_abusive/,"Hello,

I am sorry if this is a useless post or insulting to survivors on this thread but I have been thinking back on my relationship that I just escaped.

I (23f) and him (22m) meet in college and it goes really well for the first two months. We were together for a total of five months. I had never been in a relationship before him and had no frame of reference for proper relationships. He was very kind and loving for the first couple months. 

He went out of his way to see me or do nice things but I always had a feeling that something wasn‚Äôt right. Not in an obvious ways but I would feel anxious at the thought of being in my apartment alone with him at the start or I felt I couldn‚Äôt dress fully comfortable around him. Then he would get drunk and he would say mean and degrading things to me and I did try to break up with him when he first said that but he said everything I wanted to hear and did everything a girl could want. 

A week later we celebrate his birthday, mine was two days after. 
He had forgotten and we had an argument, he apologised and asked for another chance I said yes because I wanted to believe that this man did actually care about me.

Eventually, he starts ignoring me when I felt depressed and anxious, he started comparing me with a woman who he swore he didn‚Äôt like that much, he would do this after being intimate with each other. 
I asked to break up and he agrees and I take the opportunity to just tell him everything because I was never going to speak to him again after the phone went down, I hated the way he made me feel. 

I was crying on the phone and I knew we‚Äôre done but I begged to do the bare minimum and he said he couldn‚Äôt do it. He asked me to stay on the phone while I was crying and he started saying that I am enough and I was a good girlfriend. 

Once I said I know I‚Äôm good enough and this hasn‚Äôt affected my self esteem he got nasty and couldn‚Äôt wait to hang up the phone. I gave him back his stuff including a necklace he gave me the first time we were intimate and he took said it was an awful necklace and he was going to throw it in the trash. I stood up, took my stuff and said goodbye with my head held high.

This was obviously not fantastic but then I thought back on how he would make comments about how I eat, how I‚Äôm heavy or how I‚Äôm too muscular. I lost 20lbs being with him because I couldn‚Äôt eat near him and when I was away I felt nauseous. He would be nice a lot of the time but he had a snide remark whenever he knew I was going to be away from him. His favourite photo of me was when he made me cry for two hours straight and then I had to get dolled up for dinner. 

There is more stuff about our times being intimate and how he wasn‚Äôt always the nicest but it was consensual, just not fun or romantic.

I apologise if I am being dramatic and I most likely wasn‚Äôt in an abusive relationship but so many people in my life would ask questions about my relationship that teeter on asking whether he ever hurt me. 

Edit: Thank you all for responding so quickly and so kindly. I haven‚Äôt really spoken in detail about the breakup as it only happened two days ago and I was afraid that I would come across like a scorned ex. I knew something was wrong when I visited my friend yesterday. They live about 20 minutes from his home, I started to dry heave and panic even though I knew he was in work because I was so afraid of him just seeing me.",,,

Or has he finally realised what he was doing and as changed himself permanently?  I have told him loads of times about things he as been doing and it gets denied/speaks over me etc.. and he doesn't do anything or say sorry or blames me.

1jbtazk,I discovered more..,Lavendarr2826,3,2025-03-15 11:44:39+00:00,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbtazk/i_discovered_more/,"I just need to talk. Keeping everything to myself is exhausting. I can‚Äôt talk to him about it‚Äîhe always becomes hostile, aggressive, and somehow turns it all back on me. It‚Äôs like clockwork. And with the kids here, I don‚Äôt want them to see him like that.

The other day, I calmly asked if he told his parents something personal about me. I always approach these things with an open mind, trying to be fair. Most of the time, I already know the answer‚ÄîI just want to give him the chance to be honest. I need him to be honest. There was a time I literally begged on my knees, sobbing on the couch while he walked past me without a shred of remorse. I even wrote him the most heartfelt letter, hoping to get through to him. Total failure. His response? Dismissive, rude, full of denial. I couldn‚Äôt even finish reading the letter he wrote back.

Anyway, back to the other day. I asked him, and as expected, he lied. I put my feelings aside and reassured him that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal‚ÄîI just wanted to know what they knew, since I‚Äôd be seeing them soon. But he kept lying. And then, like always, he got angry. His favorite line: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done nothing wrong. I‚Äôm not lying. You need to accept that.‚Äù I even tried to minimize it so he wouldn‚Äôt feel so defensive, but it was useless. Eventually, I let it go. He‚Äôs exhausting. Maybe that‚Äôs what he wants‚Äîme, weak.

Later, at the hospital visiting my dad, I don‚Äôt remember exactly how it came up again. Maybe he asked why I was upset, and I probably just said something like, ‚ÄúI give up. I just wish you‚Äôd be honest with me.‚Äù As we walked to the elevators, his tone shifted, that familiar edge creeping in. I told him to calm down. In the elevator, I finally just repeated back a snippet of the exact conversation he had with his mom. He stopped mid-sentence.

Then, just the other day, I asked about his sobriety. He‚Äôs a porn addict‚Äîa sex addict, really. That‚Äôs a whole other story about how I got caught up with him in the first place. He‚Äôs never actually been sober. I told him I knew he wasn‚Äôt doing well. I didn‚Äôt even bring up everything else, just the porn. He still lied. He got aggressive, started yelling, slammed the car door on me, then drove off.

Later, he admitted he got ‚Äúheated‚Äù because he doesn‚Äôt like feeling backed into a corner. Finally, he admitted he hadn‚Äôt been doing well. But by the end of the day, the same cycle repeated‚Äîdenial, defensiveness. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done nothing wrong.‚Äù He‚Äôs never done anything wrong, according to him. It‚Äôs all nonsense, apparently.

The frustrating part? I see his patterns. I recognize the abuse. He knows I do‚Äîthat‚Äôs why he shuts down and repeats his rehearsed lines instead of addressing anything.

I don‚Äôt even know why I put myself through this cycle. I know he won‚Äôt tell me the truth. He‚Äôs even gone as far as accusing me of planting evidence when I confront him. And yet, there‚Äôs this part of me that still hopes‚Äîhopes he‚Äôll show me that he loves me, that he cares. It‚Äôs pathetic, really.

It‚Äôs heartbreaking to know so much and have to keep it in, because if I don‚Äôt, he‚Äôll emotionally abuse me. He‚Äôs called me crazy.

Someone who claims to love you shouldn‚Äôt make you question your own reality just so they can continue lying. I say ‚Äúattempt‚Äù because I know too much for him to gaslight me fully‚Äîbut it‚Äôs still so, so wrong. How can someone do this to another human being, let alone their partner?

The worst part? The mindfuck of it all. Because he can be loving, sweet. We have fun together. But I understand now‚Äîit‚Äôs not enough. And it never will be.

And the projection? That‚Äôs the kicker. Anything I call him out on‚Äîhis emotional abuse, gaslighting, manipulation‚Äîhe throws it all back at me in the next argument, word for word, but in the wrong context. It‚Äôs exhausting.

And now, I‚Äôve discovered more. I know who two of the other women are. Oh right, yesterday when he came out of the shower, he had scratches on his neck and shoulders. I‚Äôll post photos. I don‚Äôt know, maybe he loves her. 

I wish he loved me. But I strongly believe the cheating excites him. It‚Äôs all he ever reads about. 

How could I be so stupid? How do I still love this man? I love him so deeply, and it hurts that I‚Äôm not enough. Why are you with me? Why are you doing this to me? How can you say you love someone while being the one to put the knife in their back? You are fucking killing me. How can you not feel any remorse? I‚Äôm literally shaking in tears. I don‚Äôt even know who he is, but I wish he would prove that he cared. God this hurts so much. 

We had a daughter together, and I gave her the worst man to look up to. I just hope with all my heart she never ends up with someone like him.

If anyone wants to read our messages or the letter I wrote him, I‚Äôll share.


I‚Äôll have to make a new post to show photos as I can‚Äôt add them with the edit ",,,
1jbrqz8,Attorney Recommendations in Georgia,chelsbellsatl,2,2025-03-15 09:56:10+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbrqz8/attorney_recommendations_in_georgia/,"I'm currently separated from my abusive spouse. Before we split, he was incredibly emotionally, financially, and verbally abusive. He controlled all of our finances and frequently threatened to cut me off and/or sell everything and disappear. After a series of incidents that eventually escalated and became public, we split in July and have been living separately since. 

Before we split, he had me sign and notarize a separation agreement in which we divided assets (he controlled all finances, and did the analysis of our wealth) and he agreed to pay $1000/mo in alimony for 4 years. The intent was to file pro se, and wrap things up quickly, both to protect his reputation and our mutual financial well being. 

As you might expect, the abusive partner never filed. Now, he doesn't want to pay alimony and is doing everything in his power to lose his job and drain his assets before we get the divorce going. I've filed for a TPO to stop him from draining assets (and harassing me, an ongoing issue) but it hasn't been served to him yet as he's hiding at his new girlfriend's house and I don't have the address. 

I'm able to survive off of what we divided already, but will need the alimony to obtain health insurance as it isn't offered through my position. I make like 1/10th of what my spouse does, and have no assets to fall back on. (He owns a 400k+ house, a Tesla M3, etc) 

I am desperately seeking an affordable divorce attorney in DeKalb County, Georgia who can help me with this case. I need representation both for the divorce and the TPO. I'm also considering a defamation suit, which would need to be filed soon to stay within the one year SOL. Any recommendations?",,,

I tried one tonight and it was so positive that I immediately thought it would be good for so many victims.

The only issue I can see is that it transcribes the abuse and then it links to ChatGPT to give an analysis. In my case that was so very positive. You constantly worry that you are overreacting or did something wrong so it was nice to see ChatGPT say positive things when it was a ""neutral"" party.

The problem I can potentially see is that it might be negative to an abused person without proper context or that it may end up being too ""understanding"" of an abuser. In general AI can sometimes present a person in the best light and I am afraid it might do it for someones abuser. In my case it was overall fairly negative to my abuser but I could see that not being the case for every recording. I'm going to include a small section that only reveals general information about my situation:

# What This Teaches Us About Family Dynamics

1. **Pain and Compassion Often Coexist** Parents can be hurting, and in their pain, they may say things they don‚Äôt mean. They may lash out or fail to see the struggles of their partners. But families that hold space for compassion‚Äîespecially when voiced by children‚Äîcan offer opportunities for healing.
2. **Children Are Active Participants in Family Narratives** Children notice more than we think. They interpret, advocate, and try to make sense of the dynamics around them. Their perspectives can offer clarity and sometimes a deeper wisdom, as the child demonstrates in this exchange.

I just received two back-to-back emails, one from Aflac wanting to contact me and the second one from the Jehovah‚Äôs witness website wanting to confirm that I scheduled a visit. I DID NOT GO TO THESE WEBSITES My first thought was that my ex signed my email up for these things in order to be harassed by the sales people/witnesses, but any chance it could just be scam emails?

In January my husband repeatedly raped me over the course of a month. I have had a very hard time dealing with this, having panic attacks almost daily and dissociating so much I have been losing time. He has since been acting like nothing happened. I ended up leaving for 9 days because my anxiety was so bad I felt I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. 

I ended up going back 3 days ago after he called, acknowledged what he did and said he wants to work on the marriage. I also felt very guilty about his emotional state. When I came back we had a long discussion, in which I asked him why he would do something that he knew he could go back to prison for if I reported him. He told me if I called the police he would just kill himself. 

I told him that I am afraid of him, and that I am 99 percent sure he would never kill me, but there is still 1 percent. I asked if he knew what it felt like to not be 100 percent sure your partner would kill you. He said ""actually, yes. I've always been afraid might try to kill me if I left you"". I immediately broke down in tears because I could never hurt him, and have given him no reason to think I would. He also told me he has been paranoid for months I might use one of his combat knives to kill him in his sleep. This seemed like a really bizarre thing to say, because, again, I am not a violent person at all.  Now I am wondering if maybe he is setting up some kind of defense? It was such a violent image, and he does have a combat knife in our bedroom. Am I right to be concerned about this? ",,,

My poor daughter. Her little face. The screams, the tears, the absolute horror. First thing he did was of course to smash my phone completely. Thank God my kind neighbour called the police. He was gone before they came and they're looking for him now. I'm so happy I had the strength to walk away 2 years ago, but I thought he found another me and left me in peace. He looked so disgusting, just repulsive, much older, with black evil eyes. I just wish even after 2 years I shouldn't have been so relaxed about the door, I must always remain cautious. And I wish I hid my phone. I'm just grateful we survived this. But why. It's crazy what a human can do to another human. Why are you still trying to torture me? You want me to suffer. You think that will make me...erm... Like you again? Love you? Take you back? Crazy. Never. I was dumb 2 years ago still hoping ""he will change"". I remember the very first incident, a policewoman said ""look girl, I'm telling you now and you will mention my words-he will never ever change, you need to start the healing process now"".

I unblocked him. Then felt stressed almost immediately. Feeling tension in my forehead. It's the first time I've noticed I have those intensely stressed reactions and he wasn't even phsycially around.

I've been hesitant to post here because I'm not sure that my situation is nearly the same as the horrible things that other people here go through. I couldn't find another subreddit that seemed to fit what I want to talk about and I don't really have anyone I trust to speak to about this with. 

My partner and I have only started being intimate recently, but I've encountered a problem with it; They wont stop hurting me. They like to bite me, really hard. it leaves bruises on me, especially in my throat area. It makes it hard to swallow and move around properly and I don't like the way it looks. I've told them i dont want them to do it but they do anyways. after i flinched away really badly one time they suggested that we do a test where they bite me harder and harder until i cant take it so that they can know how hard to bite. I said no i really don't want to do that but they kept asking and i said no. I was really scared of them for the first time ever im not really sure why. but they are bigger than me and were on top of me and then they kind of did it anyway. they didn't outright say it but they bit me a few more times harder and harder until i flinched again then they didn't go harder. they also did it on other parts of me that are swollen and sore now. my flinching seems to just encourage them to keep going

why are they so insistent on biting me to this point? i don't know a lot about sex or like less vanilla stuff. is it normal for biting to reach this point? I could probably learn to get over it but it ended up really bad and it was like i wasn't even in my own body anymore. sometimes i enjoy being intimate when it doesn't hurt but 98% of the time im just thinking about anything else or thinking about when it will be over. am i just inexperienced in this sort of thing? I know some people enjoy being bitten and all that but this feels really extreme and not... right",,,

I asked to take my break and when I got back from my break he seemed to have left. He never spoke to me and I avoided him as much as possible. 

A day after that, I found out he unblocked me. If he hates me as much as he says he does, if he plays the victim so hard, why did he unblock me? I still have him blocked so he can't message me, but I am scared. It makes me so uncomfortable that he is thinking about me. I don't want to talk to him. i don't want to see him.

For a year I wanted an apology, an acknowledgment of the pain he caused me. Now I just want to be left alone. I'm trying to be happy again. So why unblock me? Why do that when he has a girlfriend, when he makes songs about how horrible I am?

I am still scared of him finding me again. I don't ever want to be where I was when I was with him. I still deal with PTSD all the time. I never want to see him again. I hate him.",,,

!!!I am safely out of this relationship.!!!


I dated a bloke who had autism. However for four years he insisted that I had borderline personality disorder. Is this normal for an autistic person to blame someone for having borderline personality disorder when relationships take work?. 

Even when we argued (as most people do in relationships as they are not perfect!!) he‚Äôd accuse me of having borderline personality disorder because I was assertive and confident. I stood my ground and called him out when he was unfair. I too have flaws but I don‚Äôt angrily say my partner has borderline personality disorder when things don‚Äôt go well. 

He is just a past relationship with no verified credentials to dish out the complex nature of borderline personality disorder or personality disorders for that matter. 

How do I overcome this toxic relationship. Yes it‚Äôs over. 

I‚Äôm in therapy but I just need some support and additional support.

When we first met, he didn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship, but I stuck around because I really liked him‚Äîand, honestly, because I had messed-up self-esteem¬†*lol.*¬†Things weren‚Äôt all bad, but he often insulted me, calling me names during arguments‚Äîwords like¬†*""stupid,""*¬†*""retarded,""*¬†*""a bitch,""*¬†etc. As I‚Äôve said, I never had high self-esteem, so I believed him. I internalized the idea that¬†*I‚Äôm not that smart or bright,*¬†and over the years, it really undermined my confidence. Even now, I still doubt my own intelligence.

I used to cry a lot and let him know that what he was doing was hurting me. He would apologize, but the behavior always repeated.

Then, about 3.5 to 4 years into our relationship, I went to therapy for completely unrelated reasons. I had developed pretty bad anxiety and had also lost all sexual desire, so I decided to seek help. My therapist never told me I was being abused or even suggested it, but she did tell me to establish boundaries‚Äîand I did. One day, I kind of blew up and told him,¬†*""I don't even know if I love you anymore. I can't stand living like this.""*¬†It was a huge shock for him. He promised he would work on himself and change.

I was happy to hear that, but, honestly, I had already built up a lot of resentment and couldn't let go of the past. So, even after about six months of my boyfriend (now husband) being nice to me, my sexual desire didn‚Äôt return, and eventually, he stopped trying. I understood his frustration and the pain of feeling emotionally rejected, but I couldn‚Äôt force my desire to come back.

We ended up getting married for legal reasons, but at the time, it felt like the natural next step because our relationship¬†**wasn‚Äôt that bad**¬†back then. However, after getting married, my anxiety skyrocketed. I also started struggling with eating in public (don‚Äôt even ask, it‚Äôs horrible). That‚Äôs how a few years passed‚Äî**a dead bedroom, a lack of emotional** and physical **connection, and mostly arguments**‚Äîwhere, at least from my perspective, he disrespected me (he says I disrespected him).

Fast forward to now: It‚Äôs been a year since I quit a job I hated to focus on my own projects, while he has been financially providing for us. I appreciate him for that, and I do take care of our apartment and our dog‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt cook because I hate it (though according to him, that‚Äôs not even the biggest issue). Unfortunately, after a year of working on multiple projects, none of them have been successful yet. I‚Äôm not sure if they ever will be, but I‚Äôm not losing hope.

Recently, we've been having¬†**lots**¬†of arguments because:

1. **He resents me**¬†for not contributing my ‚Äúfair share‚Äù to the relationship.
2. **I resent him**¬†for constantly putting me down and emotionally neglecting me.

# Some Things He Has Said to Me:

* During an argument about budgeting, I pushed back, and he said: **""You better start with, 'Okay, let‚Äôs see if we can make it work,' not all that other bullshit you give me. Anything having to do with money‚Äîas far as I‚Äôm concerned‚Äîyou have way less say than I do.""**
* **""You‚Äôve gotten way more out of this relationship than I have, just because I work and you don‚Äôt.""**
* **""Nobody has a better setup than you. Nobody lives a life as nice as yours.""**

I offered therapy because I honestly don‚Äôt believe we can fix this without professional help. He said he¬†**doesn‚Äôt need therapy and doesn‚Äôt want it.**¬†After I brought it up again and he said no, I told him that he was shutting me down. His reply:

* **""What‚Äôs wrong with you? What‚Äôs your problem? Get your shit together. Get your fucking shit together. You‚Äôre such a fucking weirdo. Just stop being such an odd person. Just hear yourself. Don‚Äôt you understand that this isn‚Äôt even likable?""**
* **""Your videos (I have a YouTube channel) probably aren‚Äôt working because you‚Äôre so cringe. You can‚Äôt even do the videos with me in the house‚Äîyou‚Äôre probably so cringe.""**¬†(When I told him this was disrespectful, he said it was¬†*honest*.)
* **""Just look at yourself, just look at yourself. Who the hell would want you? Honestly, the only reason I stay with you is because I‚Äôve known you for so long. I‚Äôve loved you, you know, but like, in your state, as of right now‚Äîsomebody brand new? No sex, not getting anything done, not cooking, not caring?""**",,,

Because he was holding his controller and I was sitting next to him and then suddenly he wanted to lift it so he accidentally hit me with it. Even though my chair was lower, I feel bad for questioning that he did it on accident, but even in the moment, it just didn't feel or seem accidental.

But I just couldn‚Äôt anymore and as a survivor a 10 year old highly abusive  relationship I knew and could see all the signs. 

I‚Äôm looking for someone to tell me I did the right thing (I left during love bombing so really just as devaluation started but because of that, things hadn‚Äôt gotten really bad yet which makes it harder‚Ä¶)

These are the issues I noted:

- aggressively love bombed me told me he loved me the first week we met (and made soulmate declarations) and was literally talking about marriage and moving in within days of us meeting. 
- he hid it at first but I realized that he is a major alcoholic. Drinks often right when he wakes up. His version of cutting him back on drinking was to have 3-4 drinks a day. 
- I noticed major triangulation issues involving him talking about other women being attracted to him, I assume to make me jealous or insecure. The last straw for me was being out with him when he basically ignored me and chatted with a bartender and later mentioned that he thought she was someone ‚Äúhe would be dating if he wasn‚Äôt dating someone else‚Äù. 
- there were numerous instances of me noticing inconsistencies in things he said over time. Probably, related to the alcohol but there might be more there. (Ex: Told me a long and detailed story about recently going to a restaurant with his ex wife to deal with some paperwork / legal docs related to his divorce and how she kept trying to kiss him and he turned down her advances. When I mentioned the restaurant later on again he said ‚Äúhe had never been there‚Äù) 
- all of his exes are ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù and abusive to him 
- he is currently being investigated by hr for pursuing a subordinate at work (this is an attractive, younger woman who rejected him and he still stays ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with and really ‚Äúwanted me to meet‚Äù which all seemed kind of weird to me if I‚Äôm being honest- also reeked of triangulation to me)
- physically assaulted his ex (he‚Äôs a big dude and she‚Äôs a small woman) because she was abusive to him. He has been married twice and claims both exes were abusive to him. 

There‚Äôs even more examples of weird shit that has raised my alarm bells over the past few weeks and I finally pulled the plug yesterday and have been shocked at how cold he‚Äôs been. He went from ‚ÄúI love you so much‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live without you‚Äù to dropped my stuff off and not even arguing with me to stay and as much as I know this is a blessing and I needed to do this, it hurts. 

I guess I‚Äôm looking for reassurance that I did the right thing (cognitively I know I did, but emotionally is different)

We have 3 boys ages 5, 3, and 6 months. We have a house that we fully own, I‚Äôm a SAHM, and my husband makes decent money at his job. My husband is almost 32 and I am 36. 

My husband, for as long as we have been together, has had a horrible money spending and lying habit. He hides it like an addiction and always ALWAYS gets caught. We have argued about this every 3-6 months for the past 6ish years. We have a joint account that he doesn‚Äôt spend, but he has a personal account that he puts $800/month into. It ALL goes towards food, video game garbage (he plays for an hour or so after everyone goes to bed), and supplements like greens and pre workout. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other crap, but from what I‚Äôve seen, $20/day goes to takeout at work. I had tried to get him to bring lunch but he never tells me when he needs more lunch ‚Äúsupplies‚Äù. Over the years, he racked up over $20k in debt and his parents bailed him out of $17k of it. This is just a short, tip of the iceberg version. 

We have fought dozens of times about his spending and lying. He goes to therapy a few times after each argument and then goes right back to his habits. I finally caved and told his parents absolutely everything he does/has done. I will honestly say that I told them in hopes of him losing an ally because he was never fully honest with them. Our previous discussion about this was really good and I felt like he was going to change. Now, we are under the same roof and barely speaking. 

Do we try marriage counseling? Kids complicate this much more. I would stay together for the kids if that meant we can get past this. But I want them to know what a healthy relationship looks like and we are anything but that right now. I need to hear stories of hope and experience. He‚Äôs not a bad person, is great with the kids, and you would never guess he would have these skeletons in his closet. But I can‚Äôt live like this anymore. We were so madly in love, but every lie has stolen more and more of that from us.

1jbaujn,I hope you see this.,Complete-Horror-3420,6,2025-03-14 18:37:17+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jbaujn/i_hope_you_see_this/,"I used to have another reddit account that i‚Äôve since deleted, but i‚Äôve made this new one as a throw away. On my old account, I made a few posts after breaking up with my abusive ex, he found it and gave advice acting as if he was another person. Shit like ‚Äúoh maybe he need another chance you should forgive him‚Äù ‚Äúoh maybe he need mental help, you should be there and support him‚Äù his exact words since he couldn‚Äôt speak english fluently. After blocking him on all social media and forgetting about that account for months, he messages me on there almost a year after our break up, i get the email notification and immediately delete the account without reading what he says. Because i don‚Äôt want to ever hear or read a word that comes out of his mouth. 

Anyways. I‚Äôm here to rant, because i want to move on, but i know i won‚Äôt be able to without getting all of this shit off my chest. 

I think about how he used to want to be on facetime 24/7. If i wanted to play on my computer he‚Äôd get upset, if i wanted to watch tv or draw, i couldn‚Äôt if i wanted to crochet, i couldn‚Äôt, ALL because my attention wasn‚Äôt on him. The only time he let me crochet while i was talking to him was because i was making HIM a blanket. I said i was shocked he let me crochet while we were on facetime and he said ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre making that for me‚Äù. If i wasn‚Äôt doing something for him or giving him attention, he got so ANGRY. 

When we would watch movies over call, he‚Äôd make me watch on my pc while I had my phone camera pointed at my face so he could make sure that i‚Äôm watching the movie. If i looked away from the screen at all he‚Äôd end the movie and start yelling at me. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing why aren‚Äôt you watching the movie‚Äù ‚Äútell me why you weren‚Äôt watching the movie‚Äù over and over and over again for hours until i gave an answer that he was satisfied with. 

A lot of times I‚Äôd give an honest answer to something he was angry about, but if it didn‚Äôt match with the reason he had in his head he‚Äôd go ballistic and would yell and argue until i just ended up agreeing with his answer instead, just to end the yelling. He was breaking down my spirit. 

Once when i got very sick, he wanted me to come over and kept persisting so i gave in. He got so angry over  that i didn‚Äôt want to have sex with him, and that‚Äôs I was sleeping too much. Once I ended up getting a UTI, and he got SO PISSED at me for ‚Äúnot taking care of myself or keeping myself clean‚Äù and was yelling at me for an hour before i had to send him multiple articles saying that women can get UTI‚Äôs from literally anything. 

He‚Äôd start so many fights about SUCH CHILDISH SHIT. He went through my reposts on tiktok, found a video about SHIRTLESS GOJO that i had reposted SIX MONTHS BEFORE i had even met him. He got really pissed about it and i had to sit there sobbing while he yelled at me.  Im sure so many of you know the feeling, being yelled at over and over and over, them repeating the same argument. over. and over. and over. until you‚Äôre just sitting there wanting to claw off your own skin out of anger and frustration. 
 
He also borrowed my switch lite and then ended up selling it and tried to act like he still had it. Had to fully confront him about it before he admitted it. He gave  the excuse of ‚Äúoh i didn‚Äôt think you really used it, i was also going to let you use mine instead‚Äù might i point out ‚ÄúUSE‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúGIVE‚Äù. If he had given me his switch or the money it wouldn‚Äôt have been so upsetting. 

Before we broke up, i had brought up the word ‚ÄúVerbal abuse‚Äù to him, he went crazy and started saying that he couldn‚Äôt have possibly abused me because i was the one making him sad and angry, and how he was the one taking care of me and buying stuff for me. Oh yes, the abuse just doesn‚Äôt exist because he bought a couple meals for me apparently!

When I sent him article after article, video after video of every sigh of emotional and verbal abuse, it was so obvious that even he had admitted it. We broke up, i posted to reddit seeking help, and that‚Äôs when he did what i said above. Pretended to be someone else and get me to go back to him. Even signed off his message with ‚Äúsending hugs‚Äù the thought makes me want to puke. 

I really hope he sees this. I hope he sees this and a pit of sorrow and regret fills his stomach. 
If you see this, do NOT show up to my house, i WILL call the police and file a restraining order. Do NOT message me or comment on hers, I WILL OPENLY call you out. 

I‚Äôll be posting more in the comments whenever things pop into my head. There‚Äôs A LOT more I have to say.

so, the idea of me ‚Äúmaking him like this‚Äù has been a common theme in our relationship. he basically says i was mentally unstable since the beginning and i pushed him this far, and that i am actually the abusive one. this has always been confusing for me because i was mentally unstable when we got together, and i actually did hit him first, so he‚Äôs always been able to use that against me. he fails to remember that i hit him because for months of me crying for him to stop looking at other women online, he just laughed in my face and called me crazy over and over. 

anyways, i really truly do believe that he believes he is a victim, in his own fucked up brain. he sees himself as a good person, and i‚Äôm the abuser. even after berating me, calling me every name in the book, cheating on me multiple times, strangling me multiple times, threatening to rape me for months, and finally sexually assaulting me while i literally screamed and cried and begged him to stop‚Ä¶. he still somehow manages to play the victim. he even went so far to say that i raped him at the beginning of the relationship, 7 years ago. i do remember this instance, we had rough sex and i was the aggressor instead of him, but it always seemed consensual, and it was never brought up until literally 24 hours after he assaulted me. so somehow i was the bad guy again and i ‚Äúruined sex‚Äù for him. but he didnt start getting rapey until about 4 months ago. it‚Äôs so confusing. i left almost 6 weeks ago, and now he is discarding me. part of me is grateful because i wasnt strong enough to go no contact myself, but another part of me is heartbroken. i wish he could see the pain and trauma he has caused me. 

edit: yes, i‚Äôve read the book. he‚Äôs definitely The Water Torturer and The Victim. intellectualizing it doesnt help how shitty and confused i feel right now though üò™",,,

We were married for almost 6 years, together for 8. Things were bad and getting progressively worse for probably the last 4 years, but in hindsight it was never really healthy. For context, some things that he did: scream in my face, break things/throw things, threaten me with blowtorch/lighters till I would cry- then get mad at me for crying, silent treatment for days, spend tons of money on stuff we couldn‚Äôt afford (alcohol obviously, guns, a boat‚Ä¶), refused to help at all with literally anything around the house or his own kids (not my bio kids), tied our 6 month old puppy up and beat him with a 2x4- pulled a gun and threatened to shoot him, always watching porn- talking to other women online- looking for ‚Äúescorts‚Äù‚Ä¶ and the list goes on and on of course. Way more than I care to type. All that being said, I finally got the courage and made a plan to leave. Even after all that, he almost sucked me back in. He got sober and started therapy and said he would change, so for a time we were talking again. But he was still demanding of me, not understanding of my fears, indicating to me that he wasn‚Äôt truly in recovery. I thought he should just be nothing but sorry, and shouldn‚Äôt have the gall to demand anything of me at all at that point. He was literally complaining to me about me taking my pots and pans (that were mine since before we were together btw). I realized things would never truly be good or safe, that I could never feel comfortable with him, because he couldn‚Äôt truly change who he is. So I gave up and filed for divorce. Since then I started reading the book ‚ÄúWhy does he do that?‚Äù By Lundy Bancroft. It‚Äôs mind blowing. I see his playbook and scripts outlined. Abusers really are all the same, more or less. It‚Äôs helping me make sense of what happened to me, and understand that he did it on purpose. I feel like I am starting to heal, starting to feel like myself again. I‚Äôve always been funny and goofy, and it‚Äôs coming back. I‚Äôm doing things for myself now, taking self defense classes, firearms classes, doing community yoga, and making new friends. All that being said‚Ä¶ sometimes I still feel so sad. I miss him somehow. I‚Äôm grieving the dream and future I‚Äôll never have. I realize that any love he had for me was only a lie, but I did really love him, and it still hurts. I understand intellectually that this is probably some trauma bond stuff going on, but that doesn‚Äôt make it any easier. I‚Äôm wondering‚Ä¶ when can I expect the painful pangs to stop? How will I know when I‚Äôm ready to move on? ",,,

So I have been in trauma therapy since december and we‚Äòre going through everything that happened right now session by session because I usually start dissociating after half an hour and panic.

Right now I feel like the person that did this to me (my ex gf) didn‚Äòt mean it (?) and that I might be exaggerating it, and it feels like I miss her, but at the same time I can‚Äòt look at a picture of her without panic and a strong wave of nausea. But yet, it almost feels like I need to go back because it feels familiar, almost secure (even though it‚Äòs everything BUT secure)

It was emotional abuse which is why I am struggling a lot with ""Maybe they are right and I am crazy"" ""Maybe I am just dramatic about it"".

Need some advice right now on how to cope with that feeling of ""missing"" them and how to not fall back into it.

I don‚Äòt even think I would physically be able to be with her because of the panic and flashbacks I get by even seeing her on a picture, but I am scared that I could ""relapse"" and lose my progress I made in getting away from her.

It was the worst and most hopeless 2 years of my life, a lot happened I won‚Äòt be able to forget, a lot of threats with s*icide and ruining my reputation if I ever spoke up, which is why I get nervous that she could find posts like this, but I‚Äòm just gonna pray that it‚Äòs very unlikely.

1jd1adh,My first boyfriend was abusive and I think I've been blocking things out,throwa09123985,1,2025-03-17 01:27:56+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jd1adh/my_first_boyfriend_was_abusive_and_i_think_ive/,"I have been sorting through some old files on my laptop and came across some diary entries from 10 years ago from my time with my first boyfriend. I don‚Äôt remember too much from the relationship back then other than it didn‚Äôt end well. We were together from age 16 to 19.

When we broke up, both age 19, he made me pretend to be his girlfriend for two more months so he could avoid having to tell his friends and family and I remember him threatening to punch me by raising his fist to my face. Then he tried to coerce me to leave our shared university so he wouldn‚Äôt have to see me anymore.

But what I read in my old diary entries has me worrying I‚Äôve blocked stuff out. I wrote this not long before we broke up: ‚ÄòI asked him to pay for something so he said he‚Äôs going to hit me 30 times as payment, I think he‚Äôs going to keep threatening me with it until he‚Äôs done them all. Only 26 more to go. He never actually bruises me though as he doesn‚Äôt hit hard, it makes him happy. I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt want to be hit another 26 times‚Äô¬†- in regards to this, I vaguely remember him doing it sort of as a joke, but with a slightly sinister undertone. Like I let him do it, the punches never hurt, but in hindsight, what the fuck?

And the following were all after we broke up, when he was making me pretend to still be his girlfriend:

‚ÄòHe said it‚Äôs impossible for anyone to respect me, called me fat, and said he can‚Äôt wait to have a normal conversation with his friend at uni‚Äô

‚ÄòHe said I‚Äôm an easy target, small, autistic, and look like an orc‚Äô

‚ÄòHe raised his fist at me again to my face but stopped last second, when I asked him about it but noticed there was no one in the library to see, he said ‚Äòthat‚Äôs how I operate, no witnesses‚Äô

‚ÄòHe wouldn‚Äôt leave my car and go home, I ended up taking us for a drive to kill time until when his parents were expecting him home, and when we parked up we ended up doing sexual stuff in my car. I sort of wanted to as I was horny, but also didn‚Äôt as we're broken up and I am already talking to \*\*\*\* (a new guy's name) but I was mildly scared of what he‚Äôd do if I flat out refused, so it was easier to lean into the horny feeling rather than deny it, but now I feel guilty and wrong'

‚ÄòHe threatened to punch me with keys in his hand, his fist was centimeters from my face and his keys right by my eye. We were arguing because he didn‚Äôt want me to come to class tomorrow and ruin his time with his friends and I said I didn‚Äôt care and might change our relationship status on facebook to say single, then he got angry and did that'

Until now I've looked back on that time as a 'oh that was a bit messed up but oh well' sort of thing, but I'm wondering what other people make of the situations described?

TL;DR my ex threatened to punch me and tried to coerce me to leave uni, how bad was it?",,,

I'm approved for an apartment and will be moving out one day when he's at work for my safety. I've read ""Why Does He Do That?"".

I just can't understand why he'd always want to yell at me or why he threw his phone at me when I couldn't pick him up from work. The bus system is free and he just had to walk ten minutes from the stop to the house. 

We've been together over a decade and I loved him. The fact he showed me he had the capability to hurt me shattered my heart. Has he always hated me? Was I just a convenient choice? The yelling and cursing and slamming despite knowing it scares me shows he doesn't respect me at all. 

I love my new apartment and can't wait to move in, but I sometimes find my brain coming back to this when I reread the note I'm going to leave behind. 

Why does he hate me this much? He tells me he loves me but his actions say otherwise. Why didn't he respect me? Why did he bother to move across the country with me if he was just going to treat me like this? Why did I see a future with him?

I defended his actions to my friends and I just feel so stupid. They tell me I'm not but I feel like I am. 

I'm sorry. I just needed to vent somewhere. I haven't been able to get this out. ",,,

Just trying to reconcile how I am feeling, especially now that I am considering divorce. 

Background: My spouse has always been a ""safe"" and caring person. He provides a good life for me and has supported me through some tough stuff with my health in the past. He financially has taken care of me. I don't really have family to fall back on.

So tell me what you think about these 2 scenarios.

1. My husband and I have never really been sexually compatible, even prior to marriage. I thought we could work through it/it would fix itself or told myself/ acted like it wasn't a big deal. I spent years trying to coach him and work through it, after awhile, I just gave up, I was tired of coaching, it wasn't getting better. I also feel a layer of judgement exists in this area, and I can't ever be really comfortable being myself. I take care of my needs myself now, and I often decline sex, bc I don't want to deal w/ things, but that leads to coercive things happening (repeatedly asking, getting mad if I say no, reminding me how many weeks/days it has been and how that is unfair, compromising on what we do, me just doing it bc I don't want to be pestered about it later, and trying to make it happen quickly). I get it, he has needs, but I feel like I kind of created this situation.

2. He wants kids, I said I wanted them, but later. I kept pushing the date of when we would try back, 30, then 34, and now I am 36. I thought I would warm to the idea of it over time (or I really hoped I would, genuinely). He got really pushy about it lately, which I get, we are running out of time. So I agreed to try, because that was what he wanted, and  I should just do that because he has been good to me (not because I wanted kids). We tried for a little bit bc I caved from the pressure, then I got panicked, and put my foot down, and was like no. Now we are at an impass. He wants me to consider other options, such as adoption. Yes, I was misleading, but I also think he knew how I felt too. I'm not sure how I should feel about that part either.

I have episodes of generalised Dystonia (painful full body spasms) which cause me to be basically unable to move/ control my movements or to speak. It‚Äôs a horrible experience on its own because you feel so out of control of your body and like it‚Äôs actively fighting against you. 

My ex used to treat me even worse than usual while it was happening. Calling me names, telling me I looked ugly and mimicking the involuntary twisting movements that are part of dystonia. It was so distressing in an already distressing situation. And then that turned into my ex sexually abusing me while I was unable to physically do anything or verbally say no. They said I was lucky that they were even be attracted to me given how [r slur]ed I looked.

I don‚Äôt get big episodes like that as often any more (sometimes I wonder if my ex was purposely triggering them, but that‚Äôs a different post), but I‚Äôm recovering from a big one a few days ago and it‚Äôs just brought back those horrible moments of being completely unable to control my body or what happens to it.  I should be focussing on physical rest and recovery but my PTSD is so bad that I‚Äôm having to focus on that instead which is delaying my recovery. It feels so cruel that my abuser is still making these episodes 1000x worse than they already are.

1jczfap,I need help,bajatoad,1,2025-03-16 23:55:01+00:00,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jczfap/i_need_help/,"Hello, I really need to know if I‚Äôm in the wrong or crazy. 

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend since last February and things have gotten really bad. I met him in January and at the time he was 17, then turning 18 in April (I was 18 going on 19 later that year in October). I had just gotten out of a five year abusive relationship with my ex. 

It started in March when he started to treat me bad, but he would always say how he‚Äôs a bad boyfriend. Quickly after, he would start calling me names like ‚Äúwhore, bitch, stupid, idiot, retarded‚Ä¶‚Äù etc. He would say that we were breaking up, but the next day everything would be back to normal again. 

He doesn‚Äôt give me the same respect that I give him. I removed all lot of guys off my phone for him, without him having to ask, because I saw that they made him feel uncomfortable. He would make remarks about the guys on my phone so I just removed them. 

Sometime in March we got into a fight and he came down to see me. (For better context, my ex abused me mentally and physically so I grew very nervous around men) We were sitting near pond and I guess I was speaking over him and he threatened to hit me if I didn‚Äôt stop talking. 

I started to get really depressed because of this and I couldn‚Äôt hide it anymore. He would constantly say that I need to get better and I really was trying to get better, but he would make it worse, so I didn‚Äôt know how. He constantly blamed everything on me. 

(Because of my ex, I didn‚Äôt trust him 100% in the beginning and I was nervous a lot. My ex would constantly cheat, manipulate, and abuse me everyday for 5 years, so yeah.. that did a number on me) My boyfriend knows what my ex did to me and still continued to abuse me mentally. 

In August I went up on the train to see him because we had a big argument and he was ignoring me. (He stonewalls me every time he‚Äôs mad and I can‚Äôt take it. He knows that I have really bad abandonment issues because of my childhood, and still did it to hurt me.) He picked me up from the train station and all he did was verbally abuse me. I was bawling my eyes out and trying to hold his arm for comfort and he said that he was going to kill me/us and crash the car. Later that day we went to a carnival together and he acted like nothing ever happened. 

I personally think that porn or watching anything online is cheating. (That‚Äôs just me.) The other day he said that he was on Reddit and then I heard sounds of him jerking off. I asked if that‚Äôs what he was doing and he said no. I brought it up the next day and he said that he was watching stuff I‚Äôve sent him. But his stories aren‚Äôt lining up, he constantly does this and gaslights me. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy in my head. He‚Äôs really good at manipulating people and making me seem like the crazy girlfriend. 

Last night I went through his phone because I had suspicions of him cheating. There was nothing on his Reddit, but when I went into Snapchat, there were multiple girls on there. He was telling girls to pull up to a festival that he was at, and I couldn‚Äôt go that day. So I woke him up and confronted him. It went terribly. He got in my face and called me a retard and many other things. He started punching my bed and said that if he didn‚Äôt do that, then he would punch me. I was able to record what he said. He left but came back later that night and ignored me. This morning I asked him if we could talk about it again and it went bad aswell. He said that I need to get myself together and that I need to get better and I need to go back to the pychward to get better. (I went years ago because I tried to off myself because my ex was telling me to take more pills and that I was worthless.) He told me that he doesn‚Äôt care about me and he won‚Äôt remove the girls. 

My problem with the girls is that he told me he removed them, and lied to me about it, and he doesn‚Äôt show any signs of remorse. I would never add or talk to guys behind his back. I just want the same respect back. He tells me that I‚Äôm insecure and crazy, but he‚Äôs a very insecure person. I always tell him how handsome he is, and that I love every part of him (and I really do.) Last week he went through my following and sent me a picture of my cousin and said ‚ÄúWTF WERE OVER‚Äù. I told him that it was my cousin but he still blocked me. He came back the next day. 

I‚Äôm exhausted and he‚Äôs taken everything out of me. 

And I know that I‚Äôm not perfect at all, and I do make mistakes, but I don‚Äôt purposefully try to hurt him. I‚Äôve definitely changed since we first started dating. In our first argument I asked if he was stupid (I didn‚Äôt know how to communicate at that time and just had left my abusive ex), he told me not to speak to him like that, and it clicked in my head. I didn‚Äôt want to become what my ex was, and I knew i didn‚Äôt want to treat him like that. For months I worked on myself, but he would say that I wasn‚Äôt changing at all. But I knew I was changing. 

He wonders why I don‚Äôt trust him, but he constantly lies about small things and it makes me wonder if he lies about bigger things too. On Thanksgiving I caught him with a vape and he said that he didn‚Äôt care. He told me to stop smoking weed back in March, so I stopped. So it really hurt to find out that he didn‚Äôt care and was going to continue if he didn‚Äôt get caught. A little part of me still believes that he‚Äôs doing it. 

(I‚Äôm new to Reddit so I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt understand too much hhh. I‚Äôm also sorry if things are in a weird order, I‚Äôm writing this as things come to my mind.) ",,,

A bit ago, I had a very emotional reaction in public where I was crying pretty hard. A person I'm close to hugged me for a while and then spoke to me for \~45 minutes until I calmed down.

It was really nice. It's the first time I think I actually felt better after crying. Anyway is this normal or is this the exception? Like can I expect this behavior from other people, or did I just get super lucky? My parents would've yelled at me for crying, and then tried to hug me and yelled at me for not wanting to be hugged, and then yelled at me for not telling them what was wrong, and then yelled at me for making a scene in public (in that order), so I don't actually have a concept of what I should expect.

I really liked how this person handled it. I know I shouldn't be trying to have breakdowns in public in hopes of support, but I will be sad if my parents' reactions are the normal ones. I like being able to be not calm for a bit because I can trust that the other person can help calm me down. When I was younger I could never fully be upset because I knew I'd be forced to be quiet immediately.",,,

1jcwiva,What could someone have said to wake you up from your nightmare?,praeda_,8,2025-03-16 21:40:51+00:00,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcwiva/what_could_someone_have_said_to_wake_you_up_from/,"Im looking for advice and support for my big brother. He's in an abusive relationship with his wife and my concern for him has peaked. Sorry for the format, I'm typing on my phone. Also I'm in the UK.

My (F25) brother (35) is an ex-army veteran and has been with his wife for 2 years now. Like a lot of abusive relationships, it was perfect in the beginning for him, with lots of love bombing. Then she switched personalities and he's been living in hell for the last 16 months. He had described the abuse, it is verbal, emotional, mental and has recently become physical. The worst of it (and this is what is told to me through other family members) includes plates being thrown and hand prints on his arm from her tight grip on his arm. There are plenty more examples of her abuse, but I have only heard it through the grapevine, what other family members tell me. That's because she doesn't let him speak to me. She harbours a very particular hate towards me as the youngest sibling for a whole other story. 

Now, our family has tried to be supportive to him. We've done all we think we can for him, bar springing him physically from his situation. 
In the UK, you can do a DVDS application (search Clares law) and I have done this on his behalf. We have also reported incidences of DV to the police on his behalf. Unfortunately, this was a couple weeks ago now so I'm not sure what's come of it.
My brother is a shell of himself. He is usually goofy, well maintained and has a glimmer in his eye. That has gone. He is so defeated. 
He will tell us, the family, one thing and then do the other. He says about how at their next counselling session he will say this and that, and he never does. He says he will hold her to her ultimatums and then doesn't.
His wife is the dictionary definition of a narcissist. I'm pretty sure if I searched up 'narcissist' now I'd just get her picture come up. 

He knows his relationship is unhealthy. He knows he cannot walk on eggshells for the rest of his life. He knows he cannot live a double life, pretending he doesn't speak to his family for his wife's peace. He doesn't have the energy, or whatever it is he needs, to finally make that call and leave for good.
The thing is, she is very sick herself. She deals with a miriad of mental illness (so I've been told) and she actually hid a lot of it from him at the beginning. Her behaviour is erratic, explosive and downright dangerous. Many of the stories of abuse I've heard about are the product of her behaviour.
My brother is a very loving, sweet man. He considers family, relstionships and loyalty extremely important, I imagine it's the army background. I know he wants to be a good man and husband and he made a vow to stick by her, for better or for worse. But this, this is beyond your vows. She made them too.
I have made the argument to my family that if this situation and its genders were swapped, we would have taken action at the first utter of abuse. I have 2 sisters, and I cannot imagine that if they had experienced what my brother has that their partner would not be in jail right now.
 
My family all agree that something needs to be done. We have a safe house for him if he needs it, somewhere she doesn't know. We have reminded him. We have told him our feelings about this. 
I know leaving her has to be his decision. He has to ring that bell, no one else. I believe he has already made his cries for help, but we can only lead a horse to water. 
I really want to be brutally honest, tell him he's pushing his family away when he relents to her obscene demands, or message her myself. (Im blocked anyways lol) But I know it'll fall back on him and I don't want be the cause of any of his hurt. He knows this isn't okay, he knows it can't continue. I just want him free.
Is there anything particular I can say to him? Anything that will take him out of his nightmare?",,,
1jcvtrj,"Am I in an Abusive Relationship (30m and 24f, need hep seeing things clearly)",helenaod,4,2025-03-16 21:09:48+00:00,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcvtrj/am_i_in_an_abusive_relationship_30m_and_24f_need/,"I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend (30M) for three years, and I (24F) am really struggling to figure out if what I‚Äôm experiencing is abuse or just an unhealthy dynamic. I feel so emotionally exhausted and trapped in a cycle where I constantly doubt myself. Some days, he‚Äôs sweet and affectionate, hugging and kissing me and talking about how he wants to be together forever, and I feel like I‚Äôm overreacting about everything. Other days, he‚Äôs cold, distant, dismissive, or outright controlling.

Here are some of the things that make me question my situation:

* He‚Äôs¬†obsessed¬†with money‚Äîreading finance books, writing money affirmations, and pushing me to save a specific amount every month.
* He¬†put some of my money into stocks before I fully understood them. I didn‚Äôt get much of a say.
* He wanted me to open a Roth IRA¬†before I fully grasped what it was.
* He¬†doesn't want me to pay rent , but instead, he expects me to put money aside for a house he wants to buy.
* He¬†makes me feel guilty for spending my own money on things like food or small personal expenses. If I order takeout, he acts annoyed or makes passive-aggressive comments.
* We never go on real dates and rarely travel because he sees it as a waste of money. The best date we go on is fast food. He makes $100-170k per year and I offer to pay too. 
* Even though I just started my current job a month ago, he‚Äôs already¬†telling me to find a better paying one ASAP. 
* I have to wake up at like 5 for work but he's annoyed I go to bed at 8 (I have insomnia so it takes me a long time to fall asleep), and go to the gym, even though he ignores me often when we're together and usually plays like 10-15 hours of video games on the weekends. 
* Today he got annoyed 3 times before 6:30 AM (once at the cat for begging, once at the TV, once at me).

* He rarely compliments me, either on my looks or my personality.
* When we visit my family (like my grandma),¬†he sometimes acts miserable even though I didn‚Äôt even ask him to come.
* He won't acknowledge me when I talk to him a lot**,**¬†making me feel like I‚Äôm being ignored on purpose.
* If I thank him for something, he‚Äôll sometimes say nothing in response. 
* His moods change a ton**.**¬†One day he‚Äôs affectionate and telling me he loves me, the next he‚Äôs distant or annoyed several times for no clear reason.

* He refused to wear condoms¬†when I asked, even though I was struggling with hormonal birth control side effects.
* When I tried to discuss it with him, he got angry and turned it into a fight instead of considering my health and comfort.
* He then told me my perspective on this makes absolutely no sense and he wants me to take bc pills for MY pleasure. 
* One time, during sex,¬†I told him it had been hurting after he had been going for an hour**.**¬†I had to physically push him off me, and then he ignored me the entire night because he was furious.

* He keeps pushing me to renew the lease today, even though it isn't due until April.
* We have had so many arguments over politics (he has become more and more right-wing and is extremely upset and offended that I don't love Donald Trump and Elon Musk)**.** He was furious after voting day when I told him who I voted for. 
* My therapist believes firmly that this is an abusive relationship. 

  
But... 

* He‚Äôs never really physically¬†hurt me or screamed at me, so I wonder if I‚Äôm overthinking.
* He often acts sweet, chivalrous, and loving, which makes me second-guess whether I‚Äôm blowing things out of proportion.
* He says he loves me, kisses and hugs me, and holds my hand all the time. 
* My mom says this is all likely attachment issues (me anxious him avoidant) and advises relationship counseling. 

I go back and forth constantly**.**¬†One moment, I‚Äôm sure this is emotional abuse. The next, I wonder if I‚Äôm just being too sensitive.

So‚Ä¶is this abuse? Is it just toxic? Or is this all just normal? Any advice would help. ",,,

In the beginning we would have a blow out fight and he would call my parents and try to convince them I did XYZ, and try to make them be on his side. He would tell me to get over being violently raped less than a year prior. Over time it escalated to intense, intense screaming. He was drunk one night and pushed me to the ground and choked me. My throat hurt to touch for a week. He told every one of his friends and family that I DID that to him. I told his dad and he said it was probably ‚Äúan accident‚Äù. From then forward when we would argue I would hide in a bedroom and he would break the lock, break the door down. I got an extra lock, he broke that off too. He would stand in the doorway so I can‚Äôt leave the room. If he don‚Äôt move out of the way I would say I‚Äôm going to push you if you don‚Äôt move. I would push him and he would dramatically fall over as if I literally threw him across the room, and tell me I am abusive. Take my keys, block the driveway, get into my vehicle. Make my parents come pick me up. He sends hundreds and hundreds of text and 200+ phone calls any time there is an issue. Multiple times when I have gone to stay elsewhere he was pretended to get in car accidents, hurt himself, be in crisis at work, pretend unalive himself and move is car front infront of the camera so I wouldn‚Äôt see if he is home and shut his phone off after saying he‚Äôs going to. Oh he‚Äôs also pulled a gun out while fighting many times. I wish I could explain the manipulation and things he does/ says to me but there has just been so so so much. I have recorded some arguments and played them for my therapist, my mom has first hand seen and heard him, I share our texts with people and ask them to tell me if it‚Äôs me. No one will say it‚Äôs me. I begged my therapist to tell me if I am the problem and she said she would tell me if I am. I have started to get really angry when he just yells and yells at me non stop for hours on end and I won‚Äôt even speak or do a thing. Today we were driving home and he was yelling at me again for 20 minutes straight, told me I am just like his mom (who is an extremely sick bipolar narcissist) and it just sent me. I threw a soda at him and told him to get the fuck out. I stopped the vehicle so fast my poor dog hit the dash. It broke my heart I am currently crying because I feel so bad my dog hit it. My dogs get so scared when he yells they shake and pant the entire time. Usually I leave and take them with me. I feel like I have just hit a point where I feel like I am going to snap and be violent. And After he pushes me for so long I end up saying mean things too and I don‚Äôt want to. I have hit him back, I have thrown things at him, I have spit on him. I give it back to him just to try to get him away from me. He chases me around and blows me up. I am starting to feel like I am the problem. Everyone tells me to leave and that he is abusive and manipulative but I feel like I can‚Äôt. I have no money, he won‚Äôt let me get a job, he sold my car, he pays for everything. I have nothing. ",,,

Have had a wonderful few days in Western Europe. Came back home today to a message from my ex saying he was surprised he was unblocked on Telegram (I genuinely did NOT know I didn‚Äôt block him and was never hoping for him to reach out to me). I just said I couldn‚Äôt talk and he‚Äôs resuming speaking with me as if no time has passed? For context, he was verbally abusive for the last 10 months of our relationship, mostly via WhatsApp. I also lost a stupid amount of ¬£¬£¬£¬£ as he always made me cover so much and gift him. Just feel deflated as I‚Äôve made SO much progress since we finished in September (went on my first trip in over 6 months this week, have lost a lot of weight because I was carrying extra baggage due to stress caused by him and overeating, have tried to eat healthy and manage my disability).

1jctb7z,How do you know when you‚Äôre ready to date again after abuse?,throwawaycrazymessy,4,2025-03-16 19:19:44+00:00,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jctb7z/how_do_you_know_when_youre_ready_to_date_again/,"I was with him for 6 years. It was very physical and he ended up being arrested. He has really bad charges including strangulation x3.. so he is facing up to 50+ years. He hasn‚Äôt been sentenced he got arrested in November. 

I recently had a friend who I‚Äôd known for 5 years want to pursue me. He is an amazing guy and very understanding, but I kept getting so anxious about everything. I was worrying about things that didn‚Äôt matter now. I was so worried about the distance (LDR), if one of us would eventually be able to move, I even got extremely nervous about him having a pitbull and one day making the move in with my cats suddenly. I was just so nervous about everything and I realized I think I was looking for the tiniest red flags to look for and be scared to death about. I let it get obsessive for me posting multiple times on reddit about the things I was nervous about that really I didn‚Äôt even need to be yet. It didn‚Äôt seem like a healthy way to start off feeling consumed by dread for no reason and obsessing over anything that could go wrong. 

It hasn‚Äôt even been four full months since everything happened and truly I wasnt the type of person that was already ‚Äúover‚Äù the guy I was with before this.. I very much loved him when he got arrested. I got concerned that this is just much too early for me to jump back into things if it was giving me so much anxiety despite the guy I was talking to now making me feel comfortable. Since I had been friends with him so long, I decided to tell him I needed to figure out who I am before dating again. I ended it before it truly fully began. I probably honestly ruined our friendship, but in the long run I don‚Äôt want to hurt a great guy I was friends with so long by jumping the gun. I do hope I won‚Äôt regret that I made that decision. 

I still have nightmares about the abuse I faced. I still think about it daily as well it‚Äôs hard not to. I still feel guilty about him being arrested even though I know I shouldn‚Äôt and I even sometimes feel guilty when I get a really good meal knowing he‚Äôs in there eating jail food and stuck in a cell. I also feel I did lose myself some, and I don‚Äôt fully know who I am on my own. Most of my interest are tied to him, and although I know I like these things separately it still feels a bit weird sometimes. Yesterday after I made my decision I reached out to multiple places to see if I can get into low cost therapy as I don‚Äôt have insurance. I‚Äôm hoping this will work out for me.

I just feel so lost on knowing when I should start dating again. I don‚Äôt want to right after just cutting this guy loose, I really liked him and I need to focus on myself. However, I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll know I am ready. I know you‚Äôll always be scared after this, but it is so confusing. I don‚Äôt really know how to tell I am ready. ",,,
1jct0pz,How do I know what‚Äôs true?,EmptyAd4359,2,2025-03-16 19:07:28+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jct0pz/how_do_i_know_whats_true/,"Sorry‚Ä¶ this is a long one. TLDR at the end. 

My common law SO and I are in limbo between being together and not being together. We have been in a relationship for almost 5 years and have a 2 year old together. He also has two older kids from his previous marriage. I ended things with him several weeks ago because I had had enough of the emotional and verbal abuse, as well as the looming risk of it turning into physical abuse also and not just towards myself. 

The day after I ended things he came back to me and said that he is never going to be the cruel man he has been to his loved ones. He‚Äôs going to counseling for his anger and depression, and he‚Äôs doing lots of reading and listening to podcasts on methods of managing big emotions. I believed this was genuine and gave in to couples‚Äô counseling with him. We had our first session last week and it went fine; he took accountability for all the crap he‚Äôs done and the psychologist seemed to believe he‚Äôs being genuine as well. 

Flash forward to a couple of days ago when I was speaking with my own counselor about whether I should remain separated or give the relationship another shot. I was feeling confident about trying again but received a text from his ex-wife while I was in my counseling session. She called me the night that I ended the relationship with my SO and made sure my toddler and I were safe and that if he hit me or did anything physical I needed to call the police. I appreciated her concern and for what must‚Äôve been an awkward call to make. The text she sent me the other day asked to talk to me on the phone. We spoke for about an hour where she gave details about her marriage to him, including that he would chase her, make physical threats, and wasn‚Äôt safe around the kids when he was angry. She also said that he cheated on her with escorts and prostitutes right after she gave birth to their first child because she wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúput out‚Äù fast enough. She told me about a recent incident that happened between my SO and their first child. 

My first inclination was to fully and completely end this relationship, that there is no salvaging this because the threat of ongoing abuse will always exist for my child and I. Three things that I can‚Äôt reconcile with:
1. My SO apologizes for what he has done to me every single day and talks about what he‚Äôs doing to be better for us, and that he will never ever be that awful man to us again. He seems genuine‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to be a fool and make a stupid decision (either staying because I believe him or giving up on a relationship with the father of my child who is actually bettering himself).
2. Whenever he ‚Äúcries‚Äù there are no tears, he just furrows his brow and it sounds like his voice is choking up. He recovers fairly quickly and maintain intense eye contact while ‚Äúcrying‚Äù. I‚Äôve often wondered if he is being genuine but don‚Äôt want to discount that some people just don‚Äôt fully cry. 
3. I don‚Äôt know anything about his ex-wife to be able to know whether I should trust what she told me or not. The same goes for their oldest son - I have caught him in lies before and he‚Äôs quite intelligent. There is a possibility that details were exaggerated to put my SO in a very bad position in which the two older kids would live with their mother full-time which is where they seem to be happiest anyway. 

Please, please tell me if I‚Äôm just finding a way to take the easy route of giving it another try? I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs a narcissist to begin with, and now I‚Äôm so bothered by the possibility that he paid for sex in the past so why wouldn‚Äôt he have done that after I had our baby and he was so angry that I didn‚Äôt want to be intimate with him for a long while. I need help figuring out who to believe and what to do. My gut changes its mind on the daily. I also don‚Äôt know if I should continue going to couples counseling with him, and if I should talk to the psychologist privately and tell him about the abuse in my relationship and the allegations of abuse from his previous?

TLDR: my SO has been emotionally and verbally abusive towards me. His ex-wife told me about physical abuse in their marriage. My SO seems to be genuinely working on himself. I don‚Äôt know who to trust or if I should give this another chance because he‚Äôs the father of my child. I also don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good idea to tell our couples counselor about the abuse privately before our next scheduled session. ",,,
1jcsqnm,was supposed to leave today & didn't,throwaway_74959,8,2025-03-16 18:55:51+00:00,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jcsqnm/was_supposed_to_leave_today_didnt/,"I had a whole plan set up but it wasn't a good or safe time. Firstly the other day he confided about a bunch of scary health stuff he's going through and waiting on different tests results, and even though that's not my personal problem and it doesn't negate how he treats me or our shared partner, ""they left me because of x"" is not a part of his narrative I am personally comfortable allowing to have happen at this time. Maybe he will hear back within a week or two and not be sick and it's all good but presently I'm not walking 2 days after being informed of this.

Second, he called out of work yesterday so instead of just me and our girlfriend it was all three of us - roadblocking some conversations I needed to have with her first in order to feel safe about leaving. This is a must for me to be able to proceed safely given certain things I can't get into here.

In the meantime, despite desperately wanting to cut things off, I obviously still love him and just feel fucking miserable. It's quite clear he doesn't want me so I don't know why he just doesn't end it. He was very affectionate with her at an event last night and not with me at all. Rarely wants to cuddle. I can't remember the last time he complimented me and I don't think we have had sex since one time around Christmas (the past few weeks I now know are because he's been dealing with the health matters and therefore doesn't feel like it, which I totally get). All of this to say since he's not even nice to me or rarely talks to me/engages with me when I'm around? Why are you still with me.

I really, really miss feeling wanted and feeling attractive and someone being excited to talk to me or want to touch me. ",,,

How can I bring this up to her , I wanna talk about it but what kind of questions do I ask her?

I‚Äôm not sure all speculation but I‚Äôm a guy btw but she told me in the past maybe a couple months ago ‚Äúif I‚Äôm ever in a bad situation are you willing to pick me up ‚Äú , right after she told me that she had a big argument with him a month prior 

Also the way she talks about him to me at times sounds like he‚Äôs kinda degrading him 

Talking about he always shows up to her house unexpected after his work and that her dad dislikes him being there 24/7 after his work

She once was hanging out with her friends and he got mad and threatened one of his friends and after that day I doubt she has seen her friends it feels like he has limited the people who she interacts with other than him and her family 

In addition she once told me don‚Äôt worry your love life will be better than mine which made me think a lot 

Lastly she once said ‚Äúall the drugs and alcohol when he gets aggressive ik when to walk away‚Äù

I'm so heartbroken and upset and planning on leaving him soon but I feel SO much guilt to leave him.

I really do love him but around two days ago he slapped me through the face for trying to take his phone out of his hand ( he had been messaging escorts earlier that day) 


And now the daycare is telling me our son is having issues and I had to tell them what is going on... I also spoke to a lady today and she told me if I don't leave child protective could step in. He isn't physically abusive to my son, but when he is Angry he will swear at me in front of our son and he slapped me in front of him. 

I honestly feel like it is my fault. His mom also tells me that I pushed him to go to sex workers etc cos I keep questioning him.. the only reason I kept asking him was because he had cheated for 8 months in our married at massage parlors without me knowing, then had a one night stand with a girl in her car, and didn't do the work to make me feel safe to trust him again. Yes we have life 360 and accountability app...but his emotional abuse hasn't changed.  He was really nice for a while and then it started again. It makes me hella confused because I feel like I ""see"" the man I love and then instantly he can change into SUCH a horrible person and say the horrobliest things to hurt me.

He also stopped taking his antidepressants which lead to this huge outburst the other day. Kicking my dog, making me re-home him, then the slamming counters and a day later slapping me and telling me he wants me dead. 

He says it's due to not taking his meds. What do I believe? Give him a chance or get away. Everything is so confusing and I'm so hurt. ",2025-03-14 14:28:44,2025-03-17 02:11:29,all_new_posts

First, I want to express gratitude to this community. You all have helped me greatly over the last year, and I still rely on this sub daily to help me understand what happened to me. 

Second, I am taking a course on sleep and mental health. For my term paper, I‚Äôve decided to focus on how abusive relationships impact sleep quality, time, pattern, disturbances, etc. - for you, for your kids (if applicable), and possibly your abuser.  I want to do the subject justice and hear from multiple voices, not just my own. 

*How is/was your sleep impacted by your abuser?* 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

My personal situation: 
- my abuser would play loud action movies while I slept, on a laptop next to our bed. He refused to wear headphones.  In fact, I was made to wear white noise headphones instead, which only added to the noise levels. He accused me of not caring about his sleep quality by asking him to turn the volume down. 

- my abuser would insist that I stay awake until 10/11pm so we could ‚Äúspend time together‚Äù aka watch TV. We both had early jobs and commutes so he‚Äôd start ignoring his alarm at 3:30am. My sleep need is 8.5h and I averaged 5-5.5h for the three years I was tracking it. 

- my abuser would punish me if I woke up past 7am on weekends because he had a tightly regimented schedule (in theory‚Ä¶) and if I strayed by even a few minutes he would blame his lack of productivity for the rest of the day on me. He has severe ADHD with many RSD episodes. 

- my abuser would sexually assault me in my sleep. Sleep was not a safe place for me. 

- my abuser went through my phone several times while I was asleep, which always caused me to be on edge when I would hear him standing over my side of the bed. 

- my abuser could survive off of 4h of sleep, and did so regularly. He would ‚Äúself medicate‚Äù with alcohol to counteract the insane dose of adderall he was on (up to 80mg per day, I shit you not) so he could fall asleep. While there were always signs of him being a controlling monster, I believe it was aggravated by his poor sleep quality and certainly by the alcohol abuse. 

- even my cats suffered. They stopped sleeping with us, probably because of the noise. 

I firmly believe that I stayed in this relationship, and was susceptible to sexual coercion and overwhelming control, because he was intentionally depriving me of sleep. I was not in my right mind. ",2025-03-14 13:51:24,2025-03-17 02:11:31,all_new_posts

he‚Äôs out of my life now almost completely, i am so relieved. the anxiety of bumping into him still lingers but im so so glad that i will never have to experience something like that ever again. i removed him off everything, blocked his number and deleted all our photos. i was stuck living with him for 2 years, 3 years of dating before that, i genuinely didn‚Äôt ever think i was going to be able to get out of it.

i am now in a new relationship, he was also in an abusive relationship with his ex girlfriend, so it‚Äôs working really well for us being able to understand each other and what it was like. seeing how relationships are meant to be and feel like is super healing, going outside again, going on dates, going clubbing again, seeing my friends that i had to cut off. i am slowly feeling like myself again. i didn‚Äôt realise how bad my ex was until i noticed my boyfriend wanted me to have lots of friendships and experience life together. i am remembering things from my previous relationship that have helped me move on and realise i deserved better and i wasn‚Äôt crazy. being in a healthy relationship has alleviated so much anxiety and i dont feel worried with him ever. i just feel so secure and safe! 

i still have a long way to go, but i am thinking of all of you that are still in abusive relationships or healing from them. i had previously deleted all my posts after my ex found my reddit account, but i was frequently posting here and i am so so so grateful for all your help and encouragement that lead me to where i am today.",2025-03-14 13:29:38,2025-03-17 02:11:32,all_new_posts

I have a friend who is having to leave a man who is becoming increasingly domestically abusive. He doesn‚Äôt stand a chance in hell of getting custody of their kids or any assets as they didn‚Äôt have a lot combined.

I want to share this experience with you guys so if someone needs to flee, they feel better about it. I (20, f.) was with my ex (21, m.) for almost two years when i dumped him.

Originally, i didnt dump him for cheating or physical abuse. I left for the emotional abuse, the manipulation, the hypocritical treatment, and for insulting and having a low concept of me. I wasnt having that, and at that point it was just easier and overal better to just be single than to keep giving him free labour, so i dumped him past nov. 5. Good riddance, i started to feel better inmediatly after. No more memory gaps, no more swelling, my panick attacks were gone, my acne improved overnight, and loads of mental space just for me and my own stuff. It was the most amazing feeling, the best relief ive ever had.

I posted here some time ago that he had some girl chasing him for years, all the time our relationship lasted. I had told him already that i wasnt comfortable with him keeping contact with her. I didnt trust her intentions. She would unfollow him whenever he would post pics with me, and some time later he would accept her solicitude back. He was gonna meet with her, without telling me. He not only didnt tell me he was gonna go meet her, i had already told him to not go out with her because they werent even friends. He had female platonic friends, and she was not between them. Thes SHE stood HIM up üò≠üíÄAnd then he came to complain to me, like the stupid little b he always was. At first i thought ‚Äúnah, he was not gonna cheat, if he wanted why would he tell me?‚Äù. But he was just that dumb. He didnt told me before hand because he didnt want me to know he was going on a date. He used to tell me when he would go out with friends, so that was obvious.

But i was tired of this bs. I told him he had two choices: to block her in everything and delete her number, or not do it, but then i would leave him. He had the audacity to try and dismiss me. He then told me he didnt want to be the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù because ‚Äúshe just recieved some very bad news from her gynecologist‚Äù. I told him i didnt care if her mom died, that he needed to make a choice. I would have left him then and there, i wasnt gonna allow him that level of disrespect. I refuse to live with the doubt that im being cheated on. He finally did, after daring to hesitate. But now, i feel he surely did cheat on me. Maybe other girl, other account, maybe he unblocked her. But he wanted to. So, i dont have any proof, maybe he hid it better that time. But now i cant stop thinking, yes he did.

He wanted to feel important and powerful, he treated me like a subordinate even knowing i would resist. He once hit me. In the moment i wanted to think it was a joke, i was surprised that he abused his strenght with me (im 1, 62 m, he was a jacked 1, 83 guy). But yeah, he wanted to hurt me. It was play fighting but he slapped me across the face without hesitation. He would show me off occasionally, ignoring me during the entire hangout with his friends. I would entretain myself, i would be socializing with em, having fun. He later would argue with me and tell me i ‚Äúhumiliated‚Äù (?) him and i ‚Äúignored him‚Äù totally. One of those occasions he didnt even sit near me, he was sitting in the other extreme of the room. He didnt talk to me. I was basically on my own in a room full of people i didnt really knew. Then their friend would make a well intended joke to crack him up, like ‚Äúahhh, she has you on a leash, ya?‚Äù (Common saying here in my country). He later berated ME for this joke his friend made. I was pissed. He left me on my own and had the audacity to get mad at me.

He was also so uncomfortable with my past, he told me that i neede to be ‚Äúexactly like his mom‚Äù (that he knows is in an abusive marriage), that i needed to go to church every sunday when married (he always knew im an atheist and i have an opinion about organized religion), that ‚Äúi needed to stop having panick attacks because it would scare our future kids and they would think hes a monster‚Äù. He would shout at me on public spaces until i would have a panick attack or a nervous breakdown. Then he would act like it was all good, and i was being unreasonable when i didnt want him hugging me, when i was afraid of him touching me, and i would yell at him to do not even try and touch me. I dont know why i was so slow at seeing i was being abused. I was literally repulsed thinking about getting pregnant and him being the father, i was thinking i would rather die than to give that man children, and it didnt get any better when he told me that i had six years MAX to start having kids, being six years ‚Äúlate‚Äù. This dusty ass man was demanding my body, demanding kids, demanding submission. He was always mad at me . The phrase referring his mom was because i was not submissive enough to tolerate the bullshit he was putting me trough, and what his dad was putting his mom trough. My current bf says he wanted me to be like his mom, because that dinamic was beneficial to the man in charge, and he was mad and frustrated i wasnt allowing him to exploit me. 

The last straw was when a national catastrophe killed and left a lot of people homeless in our country last november. He said we shouldnt sacrifice any chrismas decorations to donate to them. In that moment i felt pure disgust for him, not for what he did to me, but the selfishness, the entitlement, and the lack of empathy for such a tragedy left me speechless. I told him we wouldnt die for being a bit more frugal and modest for a year. He told me he wanted to see me mourning and being frugal. I asked if he was implying i was hipocrytical. He didnt deny that. I waited until the next day to talk calmly about this, and i told him he couldnt speak to me like that never again, and i never gave him one reason to think im hipocrytical, and he gaslit me and said ‚Äúwathever‚Äù. Then it hit me, he was never gonna treat me better. And he was not gonna do it because he didnt want to. He didnt like me. Then and there i dumped him.

Girls, dont let a dusty ass man, a coward, do any of these things. I swear, its better just being on your own. You re happier and safer. Its not the worst that your love died. It doesnt matter he loves you. Because they never love us enough to stop treating us like shit. But they wouldnt be by our side if we would put them trough the same bullshit they try to make us tolerate.

He begged like a little bitch to take him back, and i not even once considered returning to that. My life is not gonna be that. He hated me but he wanted me back because it was beneficial for him. Dont let them poison your life please. If you relate to any of these, please leave",2025-03-14 12:44:22,2025-03-17 02:11:34,all_new_posts
1jb2rr3,Feeling crazy after breaking up for 6th/7th time post abusive relationship.,c41process,1,2025-03-14 12:30:15+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jb2rr3/feeling_crazy_after_breaking_up_for_6th7th_time/,"Hello, I truly feel like I am done with this man, except i feel like I am causing drama in other aspects of my life because of the chaos craving i feel. I definitely don't want to be involved with him again, however I did get PTSD from this. My ""craziness"" maybe could be chalked up to this diagnosis, but I really feel hopeless. To add drama to my life that I was so accustomed to, I slept with a friend (who was my exes closest friend) who was in a committed relationship while his girlfriend was out of town. A completely stupid decision that I regret entirely, as I am friends with both of these people. I truly feel like I did it to start the drama I clearly miss from that relationship. Not only that but in general, just picking fights with men specifically and being hypersexual/crazy to them. Haphazardly sleeping with men casually and feeling hurt when i'm ""rejected"".

Aside from the men drama, I even picked a fight with my parents when everything was peaceful and unprovoked.

It makes me feel disgusted to resort to these things, hopefully a new low to make some changes in my life, but I am just concerned; will my body ever balance itself out, how long will it take. I ghosted him for good back in january, which, in hindsight wasnt that long ago. But this is the longest i've kept him blocked, our relationship was on and off for a year, i dont feel the need to cyberstalk him anymore.

It really feels like the relationship turned me into a worse person over all. I drink so much and smoke so much weed to numb it out. I am in therapy and have my session tomorrow and will be discussing my self destructive tendencies, but my mind is running so much that i cant wait for tomorrow lol. I hate that I still hold this hate to him. I mean I clearly did this in hopes my ex would find out, which this will come out eventually. But i understand that the damage I caused was... not worth the stress at all. this mistake evokes the same physical reaction as i guess a fight with my ex. I'm rambling and all over the place but anyway, I just need tips and advice, other than the focus on yourself exercise journal stop drinking stuff. But i guess thats the only thing i can do?? I just feel so terrible all the time. thanks for reading.",2025-03-14 12:30:15,2025-03-17 02:11:35,all_new_posts

When I left my abusive ex and filed for divorce, the day I left he called me a few hours later and was like ‚ÄúDO YOU HAVE MY PASSPORT!?!?‚Äù He was absolutely hysterical. 

I was like ‚Äú‚Ä¶no? Why would I have your passport? Did you check the documents box?‚Äù which is like a small filing box with all our documents in it. 

His answer? ‚ÄúNO!!!‚Äù

I was like what? Why not? Why call me when you didn‚Äôt check the documents box first?Apparently this is a common enough occurrence that there‚Äôs videos on TikTok about it. ",2025-03-14 11:53:14,2025-03-17 02:11:37,all_new_posts

We live together for about 4 more days, and I finally accepted that I should be afraid of him physically, even though he hasn‚Äôt ever hit me‚Ä¶ yet. 

However he came home the other night and my neighbor knocked on the door. When he answered it the neighbor started SCREAMING at him, about ME.

She threatened to beat me up if I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúshut the fuck up about her dog‚Äù 

The kicker is that I just spoke with her earlier and she confronted me about someone leaving notes on her door bitching about the dog. He‚Äôs a little extra barky for my taste, but he‚Äôs a dog, they bark. I even told her I‚Äôve seen her and her daughter walking with the dog and I think they‚Äôre a cute family. It wasn‚Äôt me.

So she cusses him out for a solid 3 minutes, I get a video, and now I feel unsafe inside my house and leaving it alone too so that‚Äôs fun‚Ä¶

Luckily, this made him do a 180, he‚Äôs gone from hostile to protective in the blink of an eye.  He‚Äôs escorting me out of the apartment, and he makes sure he walks on the side of me that the neighbors door is on (we live in an apartment so neighbors door is about 6ft from my door she could snatch or open the door and shoot me in .02 seconds)

So. I feel safe around him again. For now. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve already set a moving day, or else I very well might be second guessing based on his behavior since this incident. 

This sucks. I know he cares for me and wouldn‚Äôt let anyone else hurt me. I know he doesn‚Äôt even want to hurt me himself, but when he loses control I just can‚Äôt take that chance. 

I‚Äôm so freaking unsafe right now it‚Äôs laughable, not just cuz of others but I am having surgery in a few weeks so I‚Äôm not even physically at my strongest. If I was at 100% I would not feel unsafe, it‚Äôs very frustrating to be injured at this time 

I called the non-emergency police number but the officer that answered said I had called the wrong precinct for my address and wouldn‚Äôt help transfer me. It was a female officer too. 

If there‚Äôs no rest for the wicked, I must not be innocent either then cuz JFC the wicked people around me are resting more than me I swear‚Ä¶ ",2025-03-14 11:39:38,2025-03-17 02:11:38,all_new_posts

He said he found some of my hidden boxes and later told me he thought I was using them to move out (I had to lie and say they were for selling and sending stuff i didn't need)  he said that we had a bad/rough patch but now we are ok and asked if I thought the same(had to lie again) telling me he loves me and loves everything about me, that I'm beautiful/sexy, he's stopped groping /grabbing me as much, he even as let me sleep when I wanted to a few times. He as barely criticised or complained,  I don't know what's happening. I've noticed he as started hugging me around my neck which i don't like, and yesterday he hugged my neck again and  he wanted a kiss so he pushed on front of left side of my neck to get me to turn my head for a kiss which made a funny noise come out of my mouth.  He is ringing up from his work at least once a day now, asking what ive been upto, what im doing rest of day, what i did at an appointment i had, asking me to write down what i wanna do sexually with him. Wanting me to to show him my toys (he told me last week me using toys is cheating to him and that i made him feel really bad and messed with his confidence/self esteem because I brought toys but don't have sex with him)  he made me sit on sofa for a talk about sex, my sex toys and everything else  I couldnt get up and leave until he had finished. A few nights he as kept me awake because he wanted to talk about sex,my sex toys and stuff, I pleaded and told him im tired and need go sleep last night but he didnt let me untill he finished the conversation.

1jay8gl,My Parents Emotionally & Physically Abuse Me ‚Äì How Can I Cope Until I Can Leave ?,mitzzy018,1,2025-03-14 07:18:58+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jay8gl/my_parents_emotionally_physically_abuse_me_how/,"

I‚Äôm 18 (turning 19 soon) and still living with my parents.my mother has emotionally and physically abused me. She constantly insults my appearance, calls me ugly, and compares me to others to make me feel worthless. She even once said that when I get married, my husband will never come near me because of how I look.

She also physically hurts me over small things. Once, during my spinal TB treatment, I had trouble eating meat and refused to eat. Instead of understanding, my mother beat me, and when I still refused, my father slapped me twice.

I also tried to stand up against caste discrimination in my family. My cousin married someone from a lower caste, and my parents weren‚Äôt happy about it. I said that we shouldn‚Äôt discriminate against others and that everyone should be treated equally, but my father slapped me twice for saying that.

Any time I express my own thoughts, my mother tells me, ‚ÄúYou live under my roof, eat my food, wear clothes I buy, and study with my money. You don‚Äôt get to defend yourself or argue with us.‚Äù It feels like she thinks I owe her my obedience just for existing.

I don‚Äôt have money to move out yet, and I don‚Äôt have anyone in my family I can trust. How can I cope with this situation until I can leave? If anyone has been through something similar, how did you handle it?

He went to jail and got bailed out after 1 night. I do not have a TPO but there was a no contact order placed as part of his bond. I did not press charges. I was told that the no contact order is suppose to last until the court date. Well, its been almost 8 months and I still have not been notified about any court dates. I did not press charges cause 1) I dont want to go to court 2) i dont have money for a lawyer (although the VA told me I don't need a lawyer I don't feel safe going to court without a lawyer either way) 3) i know this sounds pathetic but I actually do still care about him. (Please don't judge me. He is the father of my child and we were together for a long time. I don't want my son growing up thinking ""I can't see daddy cause he is in jail."" Or thinking ""Mommy said I knew daddy when I was a baby but that I can't see him anymore cause he is in jail and I don't remember anything about him cause I was so young when they broke up."") 

I am surprised that the court date has not happened yet cause I hear all kinds of stories on reddit from people who say their TPO or no contact order only lasted a few days or a few weeks. Or that some could not even get a TPO at all even when they showed them evidence of the abuse. Is it different for every country or state?

I live in the state Georgia in the USA by the way.

So far he has no contacted me at all since that order was placed. But I have no doubt that he probably asks others about me or tries to stalk me in other ways. I have no actual proof. But I know that when we were together he has admitted to stalking my youtube comments.",2025-03-14 04:55:48,2025-03-17 02:11:41,all_new_posts

His aunt and her husband went out of the room to talk about what to do, like if they should call the police. They closed the door, and her husband was stood in front of the door blocking it so my ex couldn‚Äôt get out

They decided that his aunt would call the police and her husband would keep an eye on him in the meantime. Her husband opens the door to the living room: window open, no ex in the room

Sometimes a certain song will come on or I'll pass by a certain smell and I feel overwhelmed at the thought I left my person. 

In our relationship, I wasn't happy because I couldn't get over the past, and sadly, I truthfully didn't believe in his future. (He has had around 5 jobs in 2 years and constantly gets fired)

He has been genuinely sadistic toward me on several occasions sexually and verbally, and I hate the word trauma bonded because the connection I felt when it was good felt like he was my soulmate and we were the only two people in the world that spoke a certain language. 

He isn't just mean, he is handsome and funny and makes clever jokes and he can be warm and inviting and nurturing, we love the same music, movies, books, food, we had so much chemistry, we did every kind of adventure, our inner kids got to run around. 

He always wanted me, confusingly even when he was mean, but after he tried to provoke me into hitting him (the reason we broke up) I told him I didn't see a future because I am not being involved in domestic violence and he completely shut me out. Changed his phone number, deleted my phone number, all of our pictures, wouldn't open his door to me and hasn't spoken to me in 2 months. 

I love him more than I have ever loved anyone I've dated and at the same time I feel deeply traumatized by this relationship. The good parts were so good. And typing this out I understand how I sound, and other people like me in similar situations sound. But the love you feel is so real :(",2025-03-14 02:22:47,2025-03-17 02:11:49,all_new_posts

The abuse came out after we got married. Then, the man who rescued me from my marriage abandoned me after my abortion.

My husband did a lot of things to me including call me names, shot me with his BB gun because he was annoyed at me, threatened to kill us by speeding in his car when he was angry at me, threaten our cat, ""jokingly"" put his hands around my neck and laughed when it made me uncomfortable, physically attacked his sister in front of me, threaten to quit his job just to get under my skin, spend a lot of our money that I was saving to buy a house to get ""a reaction out of me"", among many many other things. After I left him he told me there were times he wanted me to die so he could be happy again. I had moved to Canada to be with this man and was a thousand miles from my family, so I felt trapped. I had made a community of friends in Canada through roller derby, my career, and my running group and was starting to make a life there. But I had to up and leave all of that behind when my husband was at work one day because I knew that he may kill me or my cat one day. I actually told the VP and principal at the school I was teaching at about my situation and they were like ""We are not letting you stay with this man for one more day"". They helped me pack my stuff, book a flight home, and drive me to the airport. I took my cat with me. I had to leave behind our other two cats because I couldn't get them back home. He targeted the one cat because he knew I was bonded to him, he wasn't cruel to the other two cats. I was devastated. My ex husband is now super religious and has a super religious girlfriend. 

Well a month before I left, I reconnected with a friend that I had dated a decade ago. We had come to find out neither of us ever lost feelings for each other over the past decade despite having other partners. He had a 4 year and 2 and a half year relationship in which both ended because his girlfriends cheated on him. He helped me realize my abusive situation and get out. For some context to what happened with us, he is bipolar and unmedicated and not in therapy. We were together for 7 months. At the beginning of our relationship he was really intense and loving, but he told me about his bipolar and how he needed to slow things down as he could burn himself out with the intensity of the emotions so we slowed things down. He was excited about us finally getting to be together again as he lost hope because he thought I was happily married. We were seeing each other two to four times a week. He had brought up us moving in together and we had also talked about other future plans like our shared goal of moving out west together and having kids. His roommate offered us two rooms when we were about 5 months in, and he brought it up to me and I agreed. He did tell me about his paradoxical feelings like how we wanted to be with me and make things work but there was a nagging part of him that wanted to be single again too. He called it his ""hermit mode."" It was an issue with other partners but he mentioned because of how he feels about me he was trying to make it work with me. He had brought this up a few times.

Almost two weeks after we moved in together, I found out I was pregnant. We had a long discussion and agreed on an abortion, but he assured me he did want kids with me one day when we were both mentally, emotionally, and financially ready. And he had mentioned wanting kids with me a few times previously. We both had a shared goal of moving out west and talked about whether we would have kids before or after we moved out west. Well the day after my abortion he becomes distant. He said he wanted to go camping to be alone because he was stressing and wigging out about everything trying to come up with ""solutions"". I had a conversation about what was going on and he finally admitted he didn't actually want kids and was convincing himself he did to make me happy. It devastated me. After that he said he was feeling so overwhelmed and couldn't handle the relationship and was debating between leaving me or staying. He claimed he wanted to stay with me but needed to break up because he was feeling the urge to use again (he's a recovering addict) and run away from everyone and everything. He put it as his ""check engine light"" came on. He had talked to a bunch of people about this and an equal amount were telling him to stay and telling him to leave so he had as he called it ""options paralysis"". His one friend mentioned how he seemed to be doing better when he was single and he seemed more stressed in a relationship. He finally admitted that he wanted to want a future with me, but he needed to be single to discover what he wanted so we broke up. I found out my uncle died that same day, a week after my abortion, and I kind of freaked out at him and was like I can't handle this back and forth we'll just break up. We were living together so we were still living together a week after the break up until I moved out. He was icing me out and just being friendly but nothing more that week. It hurt so much. I was recovering emotionally from the abortion and really needed him, but he was treating me like a friend, leaving me hanging about whether or not he wanted to stay when that was the last thing I should've had to worry about.

The night before I moved out I was at my parents and he called me twice asking where I was, when I was coming home and updating me on things he could've texted me. The morning of my move out he was in a rush to get me out, and just pacing a lot. He said he was keeping busy to cope. He mentioned having hope we would be together again one day but was not expecting it and said he might not ever be ready to be in a relationship again. But he also said there was a potential for him to move back out to Seattle and we talked about maybe me joining him there but that ""we don't know what the future holds and anything is possible"". I texted him the Monday after my move out and he showed me everything he did with the room and seemed excited. I told him I missed him and he never responded. I haven't heard from him since last Monday aside from some Instagram reels he sent me. I'm just at such a loss about his change in feelings. How he could've loved me for a decade to this. How we were planning a future to him needing to be single to discover himself. He gave me a hug and told me ""take care of yourself"" and ""It'll be okay"" when we broke up. Like all of everything meant nothing. I really just feel abandoned, he is the one person I want to talk to who would understand me because it would've been his baby. I also feel abandoned by the man that was supposed to love me the most. My husband. I fell out of love with him a long time ago due to the abuse but I am hurt that he even abused me in the first place, that isn't love. He never loved me.

I am in therapy right now and realizing I need to be single. I feel like I am ending up with men who still need to heal themselves due to my fear of being alone and finding too much of my value in men. I don't want to break my own heart anymore.",2025-03-14 02:08:16,2025-03-17 02:11:50,all_new_posts

Just got off the phone with one of the prosecutors for my case and the same thing as always happened: I stated the facts/timeline of events and yet still I doubt myself for calling a certain incident SA.

I think it has to rationalize how I still stayed in contact with that person after the fact, until things escalated even further, until my life was even further in danger. He constantly belittled my boundaries. He wouldn‚Äôt let me leave. He physically held me down. He abused me in an endless multitude of ways because he‚Äôs an abusive f*cking person but hmmmmm maybe I‚Äôm just a drama queen.

1jashpw,My emotionally abusive ex and I ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù a few months ago but it turned into a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù but we still talk. I feel guilty anytime a man wants to talk with me or shows any interest.,bengalbear24,2,2025-03-14 01:29:41+00:00,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jashpw/my_emotionally_abusive_ex_and_i_broke_up_a_few/,"Ended a long-term relationship with someone who I really loved deeply, but unfortunately had not managed to work out his mental health/emotional abuse issues throughout our 4-year relationship. We were engaged but I postponed the engagement and then broke things off because he wouldn‚Äôt stop his behaviors, try hard enough to change, or seek therapy, no matter how many times I begged him to.

He never hit me or physically abused me but he had a huge anger problem (he has trauma and impulse control issues and grew up with abusive parents) and would yell at me, call me horrific names (swear words, insults, name-calling), dump me, threaten to leave me or end the relationships dozens of times, give me the silent treatment, throw things around the house, kick stuff, punch/slam his fists, break random things, etc. It was really stressful and caused me immense anguish and I asked him so many times to treat me better, he would apologize and be better for awhile until doing it again after a few weeks or months.

I eventually reached my breaking point when his last episode (involving him acting aggressive and screaming/throwing things around the house, but not at me) caused me a nervous breakdown. I was in a fight or fight mode and basically couldn‚Äôt function for weeks.

We broke up, but he‚Äôs recently been making a big effort to work on his mental health and says he will do anything to change and better himself as a human. He says he recognized the error in his ways, the abuse cycle, how he abused me, and is finally actually doing the things I asked him to do all those years. He is meditating every day, going to therapy, and his overall mood and demeanor seems to be very different. He says that me standing up to him and not taking his BS anymore has given him a massive wake-up call about how destructive his behaviors and mental health have been to him and to everyone around him. He says he wants to change and be a better version of him, not just for me, but for himself. He seems generally less reactive, angry, and explosive. I really love the calm, sweet side of him - the kind, caring side that‚Äôs not so tormented by his own trauma and rage. I miss this side, it‚Äôs who I fell in love with.

So we are in a limbo state. We broke up, but we are talking, so not exactly together but not fully apart either. I‚Äôm considering giving him another chance in a few months or so if I am convinced that he‚Äôs actually taking the right steps. I miss and love him dearly but I am still very unsure. We have talked about how I‚Äôm unsure, and how neither of us are in a place to go on dates with or sleeping with other people right now.

The thing is, over the past couple of months, about 3-4 men have hit on me/seemed to possibly express some level of interest in me (which hasn‚Äôt happened in years; I swear somehow men can sense if you‚Äôre not in a committed relationship!). One was an old friend from high school who ran into me, another was at a pizza place, and a coffee shop. I told my high school friend (we chatted for a bit and I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was flirting with me) that I‚Äôm open to friendship but not emotionally available to date (because of my complicated relationship situation). 

When a random guy around my age struck up a conversation with me at the coffee shop, I was friendly and chatted. I was not flirtatious, just nice and friendly as I would be to anyone talking to me, and had no idea if it was inappropriate of me to be talking with him. We didn‚Äôt talk about dating or anything inappropriate, just talked about the area, how there aren‚Äôt many people our age here (most people are much older than me and it can get lonely!), jobs, etc. I enjoyed talking with him but also felt so guilty about it. Was I leading him on? Being disloyal to my ex, who I have a complicated relationship with? I didn‚Äôt tell him about my complicated relationship status because it didn‚Äôt come up and it would have felt very awkward to mention it. He asked for my number to stay in touch and since we were having a friendly chat I gave it to him, as I have to other friends I‚Äôve met (I recently connected with a couple of women and gave them my number too). 

I can‚Äôt help but feel like I did something wrong and I feel so confused and icky about all of this. If the coffee shop guy asks me out on a date I‚Äôll just tell him that he seems like a genuinely cool person and I appreciate connecting as friends but I‚Äôm ending a complicated long-term relationship and not emotionally available to date right now. Was it wrong for me to talk with him? Should I have ignored him when he was friendly and approached me to say hi? Told him immediately that I have a boyfriend/partner (even tho I don‚Äôt)? Should I have refused to give him my number when he asked (I was conflicted but didn‚Äôt want to be rude to someone who was friendly)? All the work I do is virtual and I often feel so isolated and lonely these days, it‚Äôs nice having people be friendly to me. I would have also been thrilled if a woman my age approached me and gave me her number to stay in touch as friends.

I know humans are animals, but I mean I really really don't see the difference anymore, and not in a good way. It feels bad.

Society and community don't feel real to me anymore, because they screwed me over during the abusive relationship. Those systems victim-blamed me, abandoned me and showed me cruelty.

Plus some of my abusive relationship was during covid. Plus there is geo-political uncertainty. Plus my doctor is unusable for me because she is a bad doctor. There are no other doctors.

So in my mind, if the abuse shelters are unsafe or not functioning, and the people in society are dangerous, and medical care isn't very accessible, and family is dangerous and estranged, and people no longer text or call each other or do things and hang out in real life and everyone cancels everything all the time and people are constantly sick and depressed, IS THERE A SOCIETY? Is there a community?

If I never talk to anyone and barely look at anyone, am I a human? If I am always afraid for my survival and I cannot rely on anyone for help and I hide in my apartment when I don't have to be in the world, then I am just an animal in my den. I act accordingly.

My apartment reflects that too. Over time it has begun to look insane in here. It looks like how I feel. I covered over all the windows one at a time. I emptied two of the rooms and put everything into the livingroom and I sleep on the floor in a nest. I leave trash everywhere because I feel like my life has been desecrated. I deep clean it every month so there isn't a sanitation concern, but it doesn't feel right here unless it's a disgusting cage where an abused animal would live. I want to feel like I'm in my own coffin. That's the only thing that feels right.

\*\*Don't suggest therapy. I'm not getting into why. Just respect it.

Edit: I'm even forgetting how to talk. It doesn't always work. It works right now but sometimes it doesn't. I forget words. I forgot a lot of one of my languages. Animals don't talk and that's what's happening to me. And I don't care about my food anymore. I don't try to make it taste good very often. I don't use plates anymore. I just eat out of the pot. I don't comb my hair or wear clothes unless I have to leave the house. I hid knives all over the house.",2025-03-13 23:58:52,2025-03-17 02:11:56,all_new_posts

Once my friends literally held a party cause one of our friends got broken up with, and I just wish they would consider doing something like that for me.

Well I‚Äôm finally divorcing him. Here is a list of some crazy shit that has happened/ I have found out about him since separating. 

He was not helping me with putting the kids to sleep, I turned the lights on in the apartment and told him I was going to go somewhere where I would get help. He got very upset with this. He told me that he had lost feelings for me a month ago. He also made me take my wedding ring off and told me that I don‚Äôt deserve it. I told him that this is why his past relationships have not worked out, even with his own family. 


He did not say goodbye to my sister (everyone else was and it was inappropriate and rude not to say goodbye) after she left our son‚Äôs birthday party because she did not get our son a gift. He proceeded to tell me after that I was not to drive my car with my  sister and my cousin so that we could all get our nails done together. He said that if he found out that I did we were going to have problems. He said he can have a say because he does the maintenance on the car and helps pay for it occasionally. This made me feel like I don‚Äôt have a say at all in what I do or who I can have in my own car. 


I asked him to try to keep our daughter quiet while I was putting our son to sleep. He got up and turned the lights on and tried to kick me out of the apartment with our two kids to go and stay at my moms. He said I was always bitching about something. I was trying to ask him for help with putting our children to sleep. I was respectful and kind when asking him to keep her quiet. 


Told me I was worthless for not giving our daughter medicine before bed (she absolutely hates it) and told me he never wants to see me again 

Told me to go back to being a ‚Äúho‚Äù since that‚Äôs what I was. 

Called me trash. 

Told me I didn‚Äôt deserve to wear my wedding ring/band. 

Found out the has been evicted twice. 

Found out there was a DV charge in his past. 

Found out he was married another time I didn‚Äôt know about. 

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶yeah I‚Äôm fucking glad I‚Äôm getting out of this shit. ",2025-03-13 21:57:02,2025-03-17 02:12:03,all_new_posts
1janqn1,I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm the abused or the abuser,Mysterious-World4805,5,2025-03-13 21:47:56+00:00,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1janqn1/i_dont_know_if_im_the_abused_or_the_abuser/,"I was diagnosed with pmdd in my twenties for depression before menses. I never took any medicine until about a year ago. Little less. Anyways i lost insurance and haven‚Äôt had it for months now. It‚Äôs gotten more intense, the pmdd, since being with my husband (8 years). 

First altercstion was me punching walls when i found out he slept with his ex wife. At this point we were living together and i had a pmdd episode where i told him that i was moving back to my home country and sent him pictures of a girl kissing me and a Snapchat of his friend with us. I know this sounds fucking awful when i write this shit down but ya that‚Äôs all i did, nothing more and i did it to hurt him and there‚Äôs no excuse. I was angry because he was visiting his daughter and his ex wife was staying with him at his dads house and i thought it was inappropriate behavior and he said i was crazy and ya.  The cycle. And he thinks i deserved him to cheat because of my behavior. But anyways when i found out he cheated i pushed him and punched walls all over our apartment and broke my hand. When to the er and everything. 

Second altercation he grabbed me because i was drunk and not keeping quiet when cops were called to a friends house for loud music. He told me to go in the back and i said no and he grabbed my arm and i punched him and tried to punch again and he then punched me several times in the head until i stopped. 

I have called him screaming over trivial things, mostly surrounding feeling like something he did was inappropriate. It always starts as me trying to express how I‚Äôm feeling calmly, him calling me crazy and then me calling him an asshole and then him calling me dumb and then me calling him a piece of shit. That‚Äôs the cycle. I could be making excuses but i generally feel unheard. 

(For context:At some point between these instances he choked me for being dismissive and saying i was done with the argument)

I‚Äôve kicked him out because he was hanging out with his brother (scammer, gang member and he‚Äôs also younger) but it wasn‚Äôt his intention, he was staying at his dads for a business convention and his brother came to hang out.  He lied and i heard his brother in the background. I was pissed and Put his clothes and belongings in suitcases at the door etc and then when he tried to leave i begged him to stay. This is definitely abusive behavior on my part. He didn‚Äôt hit me he just yelled at me and at my sister who was trying to call him down. But obviously i was the instigator. 

I‚Äôve gotten angry over being uninvited on a beach trip and he went anyway. I stayed calm and tried to not make a huge deal but then he stayed later‚Ä¶ and i felt like he was doing too much considering he didn‚Äôt feel offended by me being uninvited. Mind you it was just a male coworker who didn‚Äôt know me that invited us as a couple then said only one, him, could go. Idk this does sound pretty bad on my part but i called him and told him he better get home right now. He was staying a couple hours later to sleep before the drive back. I regret having done that and feel like i overreacted but if that happened 8 years into our relationship, my husband wouldn‚Äôt have gone anyways because he typically would be offended by anything like that towards me from others. If that makes sense. 

All this in the first 2 years. 
Everything after that has been physical abuse from him and emotional abuse possibly both ways. 

He went through a dark time last year where he was chasing me around the house yelling and screaming at me quit his job out is in debt etc and i stayed and tried my best to be a caretaker because, i won‚Äôt go into the details because it‚Äôs just too much but the justice system failed his daughter and it was devastating for our entire community, not just him. 

Anyways there was physical abuse during that time (pushing snd shaking) and really terrible verbal abuse. I believe he has ied and depression and bipolar and he‚Äôs on medication as of the end of last year.  

Since we sold our house he has choked me twice. 

Once because i got an attitude when he was trying to tell me he felt upset they i stayed up without him on telegram being and admin not even doing anything fun. So because of my attitude he called me a piece of shit and choked me. 

This last time (yesterday) i was upset with him and he‚Äôs saying I‚Äôm blaming him for other people actions and being angry with him for other people‚Äôs actions because i told him i don‚Äôt know if i wanna live here anymore because the people he hangs out with the most are vulgar and he knew i didn‚Äôt want that. This is also right after he dropped our religion  and didn‚Äôt want to hold onto any of the day to day things we integrated into our parenting and marriage through it even though they were good things like not drinking, cursing, smoking. He started doing all 3. He has been trying hard in his opinion not to get involved with anything like that and other peoples behavior isn‚Äôt in  his control. I told him i didn‚Äôt want to talk anymore and he changed the subject to an insult about me not hearing what he had said before the conversation. That triggered me because if an argument isnt going his way he will start insulting and just being mean, especially if his feelings are hurt. So i started driving him to work and we kept fussing and rather then taking him to work i kept making U-turns and going back in forth in front of his job. Coworkers saw our car going back and forth. He said to let him out and i said no. He kept screaming at me calling me crazy and telling me to stop the car. I finally let him out and then drove off and text him saying he was going to lose his job today then i  called him and told him he better get back in the car right now. He got back in and sat quietly i ranted at him and when i got to the part about him not taking action and setting boundaries he yelled that he gets no credit when he tried to change the conversation topic 3 times. He said let him out, i said no.  he choked me i said no he put his hands on the steering and jammed his foot down into the pedals. Turned the steering left and right jerking the car and out it in neutral and punched me in the face. I pulled over then and let him out and called the police for the first time. Got out of the car and 2 coworkers pulled up and he told one i was holding him hostage so i yelled out that he punched me. I could hear what he said when the other pulled up. I told the cops never mind i don‚Äôt want to press charges and they picked him up while he was walking anyway. I told him i cancelled it and he said he wanted to make his report and the cop wants me there. So i went back. I don‚Äôt Know what he told the cop but i told the cop that i didn‚Äôt want to press charges and he said that he was going to make a report and not arrest him. Gave us a long talk about working it out for our kids etc. 

Today he told me im to blame and my brain is scrambled eggs but im feeling like im to blame now and full of remorse and i get there‚Äôs no excuse for domestic violence but i  clearly take it way too far someone please look at this with fresh eyes. I could‚Äôve just stopped the car now he may lose his job and this was our last chance at community and a good life. He just yelled at me and said basically I‚Äôm sick and he can‚Äôt believe i think he‚Äôs at fault‚Ä¶",2025-03-13 21:47:56,2025-03-17 02:12:04,all_new_posts
1janfwu,Will young narcissistic parent lose interest in baby,CurrencyResident2370,2,2025-03-13 21:35:10+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1janfwu/will_young_narcissistic_parent_lose_interest_in/,"Hello, I recently split with my domestically abusive narcissistic partner whom I have a 5 month old baby with. I fled one night as he has issues with drugs and alcohol and it was becoming a severe issue in our relationship ( on top of everything else). Due to this I have suspended contact until we go to court for child arrangements. We are both 22. I just wondered if anyone else has been in a similar situation and if the partner eventually lost interest. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to look good in court as he‚Äôs been arrested and is being investigated for some pretty serious stuff he did to me, he has a history of drug and alcohol abuse (and current problem) and I have an NMO against him. He has little interest in the child when we were together and I don‚Äôt believe he truly loves her. I suppose I‚Äôm wondering a) what kind of access will a court allow with all this stuff taken into consideration b) will his interest wane when his rage passes and he realises he no longer has control over me.

1janb72,Can't seem to leave,Longjumping_Sky_4199,2,2025-03-13 21:29:34+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1janb72/cant_seem_to_leave/,"I need help. My gf (F29) and I (M36) have been in a relationship for almost six years. She is Korean and grew up quite rich while I'm Portuguese from a very regular middle-class background. Her upbringing, by her own account, was difficult because her parents apparently routinely preferred her two brothers over her, and she dealt with a lot of rejection, anxiety, fear of abandonment and other issues as a young kid. She said her mom generally treated her very poorly - very little to no love, no praise, calling her ugly and shaming her in front of friends and relatives - but then in she'd be ""made whole"" through gifts and money. My upbringing, by contrast, was calm, loving and not marred by any particular difficulty.

After about a year or so into dating she started to get extremely upset (yell, throw/break things, say really mean and hurtful things, take my things away, prevent me from leaving my room/apartment, even through up from anger and crying etc.) over perceived slights such as not texting her back fast enough or occasionally having to wait for me (for as little as 3-5 minutes, virtually never more than 10) due to work or similar obligations. She also regularly accused me of cheating which I've never done. She absolutely hated it every time I did anything on my own or just with my friends instead of her. She also started purposefully and noisily interrupting work calls if they ever intruded on ""our"" time, which caused a lot of embarrassment to me. Talking to her about these issues usually resulted in her pointing out that I'm ""making her"" do these things because of my behavior, and that I'm really the problem.

Despite all these issues (just scratching the surface) I stayed with her all these years because I'm in love with the sweet side of her, when things are calm and we are loving with each other. I find her immensely attractive (physically and emotionally) in those moments and I keep coming back like an addict to get more of those moments - the ""highs"" of our relationship. In those moments I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. However, I'm continually blindsided by at least weekly outbursts that completely throw me off balance and are unbelievably hurtful. We've tried several couples' therapists to no avail; we just kept going in circles rehashing fights and her noting that her trauma takes over during them.

Additionally, she often dangled a carrot in front of me - if I pay more for her (because money is important to her from her upbringing), then she'll be nicer. If I spend more time with her (because quality time is important to her), then she'll be nicer and let me do my things when I want to, etc. -- and she also tells me regularly that ""other guys"" and her exes would do all those things in an instant, and I'm the odd one out what doesn't. I've done all that and moved the goalposts over and over again (now paying for 90% of her life, neglecting my interests, etc.) but there hasn't been meaningful improvement resulting from my appeasement.

More recently, whatever remaining respect there was between us during our fights has been thrown out of the window. I've essentially cowered on a couch for over an hour, listening to the meanest things she could come up with (including that I'm a loser, I'm gay, nobody likes me, she hates me and doesn't love me, I treat her badly, etc.). She also escalated being physically destructive and yelling at me at the top of her lungs right next to my ears to the point that my ears were ringing for hours afterwards. She's dragged bedding away from me when I was trying to sleep and shone her phone's flashlight into my face trying to keep me up because she was upset that I had to do some late work while we were traveling.

And yet, I still come back the next day forgiving everything just to stay with her. I put all the bad things away and hope that there's some path for our relationship to just be loving and that we'll have a happy ending together, growing old together. I'm so off-balance that I rationally know that I'm a good person yet her continually telling me that I'm the bad guy here causing all of her behavior has eaten away at me that it keeps me wondering - am I the problem after all? I'm scared of starting over and I'm scared that I might regret walking away from this even though all the evidence points to things just continuing to get worse. I feel like I'm in jail, scared of really acknowledging what's going on and scared of a future after all these years where I've tried so hard to make it work. I'm also beyond exhausted and sad.",2025-03-13 21:29:34,2025-03-17 02:12:07,all_new_posts

We don‚Äôt live together but I live with someone he‚Äôs close to, the rent is affordable rn and I was in a toxic situation at my last apartment before living here. 

I can‚Äôt move just yet, I don‚Äôt make enough to get a place on my own and I‚Äôm terrified of moving into a place with narcissistic roommates and landlord again. 

I‚Äôve got somewhat of a plan, but I‚Äôm worried about keeping things calm/steady, until I am able to leave and just cut him off 100% all at once. 

I don‚Äôt care for him anymore, yet at the same time I still do? It‚Äôs confusing and frustrating. Part of me wants to try to end things amicably, but from what I‚Äôve been reading, it‚Äôs probably best not to say anything and just leave. In the past when arguing and maybe once when we weren‚Äôt fighting, he said he think things would be amicable between us and he‚Äôd still wanna be friends if we split. I used to believe that, but now idk, I want too, but I‚Äôm scared to put any more trust into him. 

I also have some stuff of his, and things like pictures and gifts I need to give him/leave for him. (Some things I don‚Äôt want, he‚Äôll definitely be angry if I keep some things, and there‚Äôs things we‚Äôve used together that I can‚Äôt reuse with someone else((if I ever date again)).

I know it‚Äôs stupid, but I‚Äôm worried about how his friends and family might see me afterwards. What he‚Äôll tell them is the reason for breaking up. Or if I just disappear. 

I don‚Äôt have friends that are reliable, so that‚Äôs not an option. Some family lives far away, and could be an option, but they might not be by the time I‚Äôm able to get out. 

I tried looking up places/organizations in my state, but I got too overwhelmed, and I didn‚Äôt get far. And I‚Äôm scared how that might affect me? Idk how to explain it, it doesn‚Äôt make sense. ",2025-03-13 21:11:30,2025-03-17 02:12:08,all_new_posts

Recently hes gotten more aggressive and annoyed with me, everytime i do something or ask him for some kind of reassurance, or even ask him what hes doing, he always gets annoyed with me and often snaps at me. He doesnt see the problem, even if i sometimes mention it to him, and i feel like its ruining our relationship. At the beginning of our relationship he was really loving and wasnt getting annoyed at me ever, but he did have a small problem with communicating, but now he doesnt communicate with me ever, even if i try talking to him about stuff and about what did i do wrong, he never talks to me about it but he expects me to change. I always explain to him that i cant possibly change, and i take my time to try to get him to talk to me about his feelings, but he never opens up to me about my wrong doings. Recently he started getting mad at me for just asking him too many questions, which i told him i need to know some stuff because he never tells me anything anymore, in which he said he doesnt care and to just stop asking him anything. How do i talk to him about my feelings without making him annoyed? When we are having normal conversations hes acting normal, but when i start talking about my feelings he gets mad and often leaves me and wont answer me. How do i tell him that him getting annoyed at me all the time has a massive impact on our relationship without him telling me im ""pulling a victim card""?
Id like to mention that i have BPD that ive been working on, and he has autism. Our relationship is long distance, and we have never met. I know the relationship isnt too good but i dont wanna leave him, i wanna work on the relationship since he means a lot to me. Im sorry that the text is messy and for all the grammar mistakes, english isnt my first language but i really need some advices.",2025-03-13 20:41:59,2025-03-17 02:12:09,all_new_posts

I am engaged and had some fights with my fianc√©, I‚Äôve never cheated or disrespected him, we live together and spend a lot of time together. He has been acting weird since the boob job, I was so happy that he would enjoy the enhancement and asked him to buy me lingerie bc he loves it and I feel way more confident now. So yesterday I did some shopping and bought some dresses that show cleavage, I am thin and tall and they look great, not like kardashian style or stuff like that.. However he called me a hoe, said he wouldnt want the mother of his children to dress like one nor marry one.. also he is a hypocrite bc he looks for girls in OF and I didnt use to care.. but now I think.. why is it ok when he does that but I cant dress a bit sexy?

He is giving me some macho vibes and after he said those things I blocked him and wouldnt come back to our apartment, I am with my family.

I also forgot to mention he said that my father and brother would be ashamed of me bc of how I looked.. so I asked them just for curiosity and they both said I look great! They even encouraged me to wear these. Just to give you some context..

I am seriously offended. What do you guys think?",2025-03-13 19:01:20,2025-03-17 02:12:12,all_new_posts

I had to leave my best friend because their partner emotionally abused and manipulated me. For almost a year I thought I was crazy for suspecting it but the more I dug the more my suspicions were validated. 

She had a history of emotionally abusing friends, I reached out to a former friend group of hers and was told a nearly identical series of events to my own experience. I reached out to current friends and they said they weren't surprised by this behavior and that she seemed like the type.

Yet when I told my best friend all of this they did nothing. They are continuing to be with someone who hurt me so badly I wanted to end my life. They made me think that something was wrong with me. That I was broken. That I was worthless. That I deserved to be treated like trash. To say that I am disappointed by their decision was to stay is an understatement.

For my own peace, leaving was the right choice, but I'm so devastated by this loss. They told me they would think about it, but it felt like they made their decision before I even finished talking to them. I miss them so much.",2025-03-13 18:20:47,2025-03-17 02:12:13,all_new_posts
1jaijlr,Migraine and feeling of lost post break up,Same_Distance2328,1,2025-03-13 18:09:44+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jaijlr/migraine_and_feeling_of_lost_post_break_up/,"June 2024 ‚Äì I was on a work assignment in Turkey when I met K, a Kurdish guy. We spent eight days together, and things quickly clicked between us.

After returning to India, he kept pressuring me to commit for a month. However, I kept saying no because I was still in the process of ending things with someone else and had multiple reservations about K. I sensed he had anger issues and was trying to control my life unnecessarily. I wanted to take some time for myself to fully move on from the first guy, avoiding any overlap, but K insisted I stay with him while ending things with the other person. I explained that I couldn‚Äôt cut ties abruptly because we had mutual friends and I wanted to part on good terms.

His response? He threatened to expose our relationship at my workplace unless I ended things with the other guy immediately. Given the unsaid rules of my job, this could have cost me my position. Panicked, I did what he demanded. Later, he denied ever making such a threat.

The next four months were a nightmare.
	‚Ä¢	He forced me to tell my parents about him just three months into dating.
	‚Ä¢	He pressured me to quit my job and find a remote one so that I could move to Turkey.
	‚Ä¢	He slut-shamed me for having male friends.
	‚Ä¢	If I complimented even a female friend, he‚Äôd accuse me of sleeping with her.
	‚Ä¢	He justified hurting me by saying it was out of ‚Äúlove and care.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	He constantly monitored my whereabouts, demanding to know where I was at all times. If I went out with friends, regardless of gender, without telling him, he would make my life hell.
	‚Ä¢	He controlled my finances, questioning how I spent money on my friends and family and telling me I shouldn‚Äôt help them.
	‚Ä¢	He reduced me to a lifeless, crying wreck. I cried almost every night. He would yell at me any time, for anything.

The breaking point came when I spent New Year‚Äôs with him and his family.
	‚Ä¢	My flight was delayed by four hours, making my total journey nearly 12 hours long. He decorated the hotel room with lights and balloons, which I appreciated with enthusiasm and kisses. But because I was exhausted, my ‚Äútired voice‚Äù wasn‚Äôt enough for him. I crashed immediately after arriving.
	‚Ä¢	The next day, he kept me hungry until 3 PM (which was even later in my time zone).
	‚Ä¢	That night, he accused me of being ‚Äúincompetent at loving him‚Äù and insisted that I text him every hour if I was out‚Äîeven though my stance was simple: If I know you‚Äôre at a party, isn‚Äôt it obvious that you‚Äôll be busy for a few hours? Why do I need to keep proving I care?
	‚Ä¢	We got drunk on an empty stomach and passed out‚Äîmeaning no sex that night. We had already been intimate that morning, but apparently, that wasn‚Äôt enough.

The next morning, he scolded me for not having enough sex with him and continued berating me over trivial misunderstandings, even when I agreed with him. During a four-hour train ride, he insulted and degraded me non-stop until I broke down crying. I was completely drained when we arrived at his home, where his mother also lived.

One evening, my ex called to offer a final apology. Since I had nothing to hide, I picked up. K exploded with rage and demanded that I leave his home immediately. As I sat on the floor packing my bag, he dragged me onto the bed and forced me to endure another round of his slut-shaming.

The worst part? The sex.
	‚Ä¢	He was obsessed with it, constantly pushing for intimacy in inappropriate places.
	‚Ä¢	His idea of sex involved only two things: I had to ride him, and I had to perform oral on him.
	‚Ä¢	If I asked for a change, he would do it half-heartedly for a few seconds before going back to what he wanted.
	‚Ä¢	He pressured me daily for phone sex, and if I agreed, he‚Äôd call me a slut.
	‚Ä¢	He called me a slut during sex, slapped me, and ignored me when I repeatedly told him I didn‚Äôt like it.

I finally broke up with him, realizing it was for the best. But even after that, he kept trying to manipulate me. When I finally told him why I hated sex with him, he lashed out and cut all ties, calling me an ‚Äúugly bitch‚Äù who only wanted to hurt him.


Now, I am left with migraine and no life. I can't get out of bed in morning just wants days to pass. I know I have been wrong at some places but I still don't believe my suffering can be justified. Help me to move on.",2025-03-13 18:09:44,2025-03-17 02:12:14,all_new_posts

1jai2iw,Run of the mill abuse and running my life,Legitimate-Clue-102,2,2025-03-13 17:50:06+00:00,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jai2iw/run_of_the_mill_abuse_and_running_my_life/,"Husband was on a work trip. I've been trying to make appointments for one of our infants (had twins recently) so she can get a helmet. I find out from the specialist that our insurance says it's going to expire so they may not be able to take our case. I know nothing about this so I call the insurance company. They inform me that my husband doesn't have me listed as someone privy to policy information. They offer to three-way call his HR company to ask about the policy expiration. They also tell me I'm not listed as someone privy to the information.

At this point it looks like he has forgotten to renew the insurance (probably not because employer insurance usually auto-renews), or has taken me and our 3 kids off of his insurance in another destructive fit of rage. I then have to call him, and I'm crying, because, people cry, and that's ok. I'm not hysterical - just crying. I explain the situation without telling him my suspicions about his actions, and he immediately screams at me. Why does he scream? Not because of what I found out - but because I'm crying. He hates crying. He has, in the past, even gone so far as to tell me to shut up when I'm crying, and stomped on the 2nd floor ceiling when our daughter cried during a bath. He tells me it's my fault I let the insurance lapse because I didn't give him our daughters' social security numbers (I handed them to him and watched him enter the information). I told him that I don't work for his company, so how can I sign us up for anything? Still my fault and I should call his employer. I rolled my eyes into next year. He's clearly got a guilty conscience about his actions.

I tell him I'm going to get off the phone (I always quickly end calls when he starts screaming - - there's no point in talking after that). He then starts texting me horrible things, so I block him. I can see he is texting how dare I block him, I'm a c-word, and that blocking him is abusive. I'm a bad mom and I made him lose his last job and prevent him from getting ahead all the time (he legit threw and broke work equipment in front of all his coworkers and got fired).

I called a bunch of hotlines to calm myself down because the drama led to a panic attack. He's like this every day. Multiple people have told him he's abusing me and he just does not care and tells them they're wrong. My counselor tries to make the excuse that he needs to be evaluated for Bipolar, and I have decided there is no more excusing his actions.

He apologizes in a text at the end of his rant with a ""sorry"". I didn't reply or anything. I'm beyond done. I don't want him thinking he has control over me, but of course, he then doubled-down and ignored me back. He didn't even tell me what time he'd be home from the work trip yesterday. He then did what he always does and waited to come home until after I was asleep (1am or so). I woke up to feed our twins around 3 am and he was in the office playing video games. That's all he cares about.

The next morning he, of course, acts like nothing happened. I had to continue to try to get information from him about the insurance so I could call and make appointments. He was full-on rolling his eyes when I told him he had to call them. I cannot believe a person like this exists.

Please, no, ""get out, it will only get worse"", ""leave"", ""or ""I allow it by being here"" ""you're not trapped"" comments. I'm looking for community and I won't be quieted.",2025-03-13 17:50:06,2025-03-17 02:12:16,all_new_posts

And at the time I thought that these would be the largest hurdles for me to overcome as a I got older. However, something I didn‚Äôt recognize as sexual trauma until quite recently, has seemed to take the front seat. 

Due to living conditions (no electricty, no heat, etc.) there were periods of time throughout my adolescence and childhood where I would need to sleep in my parents room. Oftentimes during these sleepovers in my parents room, I would struggle to fall asleep or stay asleep due to my parents being intimate not even a few feet from me. (I often slept on a couch that was at the foot of their bed). I would always think back then that it was just a product of my living situation and it was normal for parents to do this with their kid in the room. That they likely forgot I was even there. 

WILD üôÉ I know. Now as an adult, I realize that I can‚Äôt even have intimacy without realizing my dog / cat within the room. So there‚Äôs no way that my parents were doing this so frequently, without having any thought regarding their child sleeping at the foot of their bed. I now know that even though I did not experience the sexual trauma firsthand from my father, it still provided its own lasting imprint on how i can engage sexually. 

During college, while coming to terms with a lot of my trauma, my mother finally seemed like she might want to leave my dad. (She met someone online, it turned out it was some catfish‚Ä¶ which i actually felt bad for because I desperately wanted my mom to escape the DV from my father). At this time, she had confided to me that my father often raped her throughout their marriage. 

In that moment, my understanding of my childhood sexual abuse changed. I was not longer experiencing witnessing my parents have sex, but witnessing my father often rape my mother. As it was clear to me at the time that she did not want to engage in intimacy with me sleeping so close. Looking back now I realized how often I was an innocent bystander to my mother being raped.

My mother unfortunately has never left my father, and has stuck by him throughout my healing journey. Aside from this, there‚Äôs so many other reasons that I‚Äôve become no - contact with my parents. But this situation is the one I wish I could get an explanation for the most.

As an adult I now accept that this was sexual abuse, and I can claim that for myself. I find peace in knowing if I ever have children, this is not something I would accept as normal. I just only wish I realized earlier, and deeply wish that realizing this wouldn‚Äôt completely alter my relationship to sex.

Im writing this to see if anyone else experienced similar abuse and the additional experience of not realizing it until way later in life.",2025-03-13 16:28:23,2025-03-17 02:12:20,all_new_posts

But there's a part of me that feels like I owe it to the guy who was good to me, even though that same guy beat me up and has been so manipulative and abusive for the last 2 years. 

And then I'm afraid of giving into to talking to him and feeling compelled to give him a chance?? 

I know deep down this is wrong. Why do I struggle to much to feel like someone who treated me this way, doesn't think I care about them? Like why does it bother me so much that he thinks I'm bad, when I know he already does? ",2025-03-13 16:02:07,2025-03-17 02:12:21,all_new_posts

I understand that with abusive relationships some people tend to go back multiple times in hopes of change or familiarity.

However, one thing that makes me question is do the individual actually want to go back or are they only going back to the abuser to avoid future trouble?

The guy I was talking to keeps going back to his abuser. This would probably be his 5th time I would say‚Äîbut my second time giving him a chance.

He told me how toxic things were, his friends even told him, etc. Yet, he went back again. 

We got into a real intense argument this time because he called me a c-word and told me we only talked because they weren‚Äôt together. 

I‚Äôm convinced that he doesn‚Äôt truly feel that way with how his vulnerability began to show when he kept saying he was sorry for not telling me about her.

I think that he only told me those things because he probably wanted to show her that he doesn‚Äôt care about me to avoid abuse on his end.

Every failure of mine was a moment of satisfaction for her; every success, dismissed. She once told me outright, ""I will never compliment you because I don't want it to go to your head.""
To the outside world, she put on a perfect act, but that level of pretense was exhausting. If things didn‚Äôt go her way, I was the one who paid for it. She was, without a doubt, the most selfish person I‚Äôve ever known.
People change. Words leave scars. Anything given freely is taken for granted. Go above and beyond once, and that becomes the new expectation‚Äînever appreciated, never acknowledged.

Was I wrong for trying to leave?,SenseSpirited7892,1,2025-03-13 13:51:48+00:00,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jacfw7/feeling_so_confused_was_i_wrong_for_trying_to/,"I‚Äôve been feeling so discombobulated lately, I need help understanding that I‚Äôm not crazy.

For some background, I have been with my partner for 6 months. I tried to break up with him somewhat recently, but came back. I will list what led up to my decision.

‚Ä¢ When a friend of mine criticized him and it made me have some slight doubts, he made up a false accusation towards her, made transphobic comments about her, then said that if I did not cut things off with her he would physically harm her. (When I tried to call him out after getting back together for doing something so horrible, he said that maybe it was ‚Äòwrong‚Äô but that ‚Äòhorrible‚Äô is an exaggeration)

‚Ä¢ He said I can‚Äôt hang up a tapestry or get a tattoo for a male deity I worship out of jealousy, he said it seemed like I was ‚Äúfangirling‚Äù. (He still gets angry if I mention said deity)

‚Ä¢ He would always come up with any tiny criticism about anyone in my support system who didn‚Äôt absolutely love him and would use it as an excuse for me to cut them off. He also made a ‚Äòrule‚Äô that anytime him and I were going through something I couldn‚Äôt talk about it with anyone else but him. (His suspicion has intensified since getting back together because it was a friend that made me realize how bad things were)

‚Ä¢ He banned me from listening to kpop in the car or going to kpop concerts because he would get upset about the men. (He has now lifted that ban but was quite unhappy about it)

‚Ä¢ He often ‚Äòteases‚Äô me and makes jokes towards me, but when I try to do the same he often gets upset. There was even one time he kept throwing sexist jokes at me and when I got angry he used my outburst against me.

‚Ä¢ He attempted to beat up a teenager when said teenager tried to ask for my number, and refused to stop when I tried to pull him away. No one actually got hurt but it was to the point that security got involved. (He said after this event he realized he no longer wants to act like that and desires to change. It is true he has not attempted or threatened any physical harm since, but has said he still feels desires to)

‚Ä¢ He regularly treated me like a therapist, even once saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a therapist, I have you.‚Äù (He later claimed this was a joke)

‚Ä¢ He said I could only go to a couple certain places by myself that I know no man will bother or hit on me. He also said I couldn‚Äôt go out in very revealing clothing unless I‚Äôm out with him. (He has doubled down to saying I can‚Äôt wear revealing clothes in general)

‚Ä¢ He has yelled at and hit his dog. He did ease on it after I called him out for it, but idk about when I‚Äôm not around.

‚Ä¢ After I broke up with him then reached back out, he told me I was vile, cruel and shitty and berated me for a few days straight. He said that in my goodbye message I was ‚Äòvicious‚Äô, even though I said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù like 20 times and every person I have showed it to said it was rather gentle. Yes, I blocked him after, but it was because my friend told me he was potentially dangerous.


He claims me trying to leave him has traumatized him, and that his anger and behavior that led to me breaking up with him was rooted in him being mistreated by society and past trauma, so it was unfair of me to give up on him. 

He said that if I want to relationship to work I would have to put my all into being the best ‚Äòwife‚Äô I can be and to practice more initiative. As you can imagine his definition of a ‚Äògood wife‚Äô is quite traditional, and he wants me to fully adjust to his culture. I have been cooking for him, almost completely taken over taking care of his dog, cleaning, etc. With this plus adjusting to a new medication, I‚Äôve been exhausted. The only solace I‚Äôve had is going to the park by myself an hour a day to engage in joyful movement. 

However, today he sat me down and said he‚Äôs been disappointed in how I haven‚Äôt been doing enough things with him that he enjoys, and that me taking time for myself at the park everyday was getting in the way and making me too tired to do more things he liked with him. Out of exasperation I started crying and said that I felt like I‚Äôll never be enough, and he said he‚Äôs the one that should be feeling that way because of the message I sent him when I broke up with him. Also he made me stay up until 1am until he felt like he was done venting and anytime I would say that I was tired he would say ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt you say you‚Äôd do anything for me?‚Äù

I‚Äôm feeling so exhausted, idk what to do. Should I feel bad? Am I overreacting? All my friends say he‚Äôs toxic and potentially dangerous, but he‚Äôs very good at convincing me that I‚Äôm the toxic one.",2025-03-13 13:51:48,2025-03-17 02:12:34,all_new_posts

I just want to share solitude and love to everyone that‚Äôs either healing after leaving, contemplating how to escape, and those that are unfortunately just experiencing the horrific behavior of our abusers. You matter, this is not your fault, and you absolutely are worthy of safety. Abuse can make us feel less than, because an abusive person‚Äôs low self-esteem encourages them to hurt us. Even though it may be difficult, I want you to know for a solid fact, you DO deserve more and you‚Äôre sooooo special. You light up the room when you walk in, you make someone happy that you‚Äôre alive, and there are people wishing for a you. 

What I‚Äôve come to understand is that these abusers really hate themselves and their lives, so they try to reconcile that by being horrible to others. They believe this false sense of superiority and it‚Äôs just making them worse off. Even if you‚Äôre standing up for yourself, that‚Äôs still not a reason for you to be abused. I don‚Äôt care what they try to tell you. I still battle with the guilt of leaving people I really loved, but I‚Äôd rather be safe and offered genuine love than fearing the next form of abuse. I‚Äôm not saying you won‚Äôt be scared after escaping, but at least you have the certainty of yourself and no one attacking you every chance they get. These people are not on the same emotional and mental level as us, whereas we try to do good in the world and work on ourselves.

I used to cry because the person I loved so deeply kept actively choosing to tear me down and abuse me, despite me begging, presenting healthy connection tactics, praying, offering them spiritual advice, and reasoning with ‚Äúa potential justified cause‚Äù of this behavior. Multiple times and it unfortunately had been happening this way my entire life. I urge you to find good community and expose yourself to a healthy relationship. You‚Äôll see so quickly the red flags that they‚Äôd manipulated to look like slight yellows and light greens in the beginning or throughout the relationship.

I get hesitant to write about the very real experience, because I get watched online. That‚Äôs the worst part about it. I will never understand how someone could choose to hurt you, so you feel unwanted. But when you leave and seek support they even know you deserve, they either watch you or have people do it for them. Blasphemous. It just speaks to the fact that you do not deserve this. Over the past 4-5 years, my abusers have stalked me and continually harassed me with post-relational abuse, even though I let them be and chose to heal in private. You don‚Äôt have to. You can be as loud about your pain as you need, because you suffer in silence. You deserve to heal. You deserve to smile. You deserve true love.

I watched a video this morning of a girl about to marry a man that wasn‚Äôt even sure of her and now, she‚Äôs marrying a very good man, who believes her to be his best friend and the true love of his life. The reality is, unlike what some of us have heard similarly but were never treated right, this man was all about his talk. So, I say this to say that your love is waiting for you in SO many forms, please know it‚Äôs possible for each of us. TRUE Love finds you in the ways that you need the most throughout life, and it‚Äôll never make you feel confused. Not about yourself of anything else. It‚Äôll be the most certain and safest experience you‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôm wishing the best for you all. 

If you ever need emotional support or affirmations, please contact me! Xo",2025-03-13 13:13:09,2025-03-17 02:12:35,all_new_posts

He gave me a three-hour lecture about how I'm the worst person alive, how I‚Äôm leaving him during the worst time of his life (his mom is sick, and everything is chaotic‚Äî I do feel bad about that part, I loved the old woman), how I‚Äôm a selfish, disgusting rat for ‚Äúruining his family‚Äù because I ""don‚Äôt feel right here anymore,"" and how I‚Äôve been lying about loving him all this time. He said he‚Äôd be dead the second I stepped my foot out the door.

He threatened suicide multiple times and even cut his wrists while I was still there, but I should be thankful that he was ‚Äúnice enough not to kill himself in front of me.‚Äù I listened, took it all in, and then left.

Then, on the bus, I got a call asking me to go back because someone needs to watch the dog while he‚Äôs at work tomorrow. For a second, I almost caved and went back. But instead, I called my dad, who helped me get my head straight over the phone. We made a plan, and I really left. I actually left. Can you believe that?

Now, I know I‚Äôm stupid, but I‚Äôm going back to look after the dog for today. That poor thing didn‚Äôt ask for any of this. Chris won‚Äôt be home while I‚Äôm there, so I‚Äôll have a chance to pack up more of my stuff. But I still feel like I should go back. Last night, he lovebombed me, and for a second, I thought he might change (I‚Äôll include some of his messages at the end). But I texted my cousin, who‚Äôs basically my biggest supporter and protector since we were kids, and she told me, ‚ÄúOh HELL NAH, don‚Äôt believe a word he‚Äôs saying. It‚Äôs all manipulation.‚Äù So, I didn‚Äôt reply to Chris and went to sleep instead.

The first afternoon and night were pure hell. I had the longest, most painful breakdown of my life, crying and screaming like a little kid for around four hours after I got to my mom‚Äôs place. It was strange because Chris was actually on the phone with my mom when I arrived, crying to her about me.

I was considering catching a night bus back to apologize, to beg for his forgiveness, but instead, I texted someone again- my friend 'Dave' this time (who I‚Äôve been accused of cheating with multiple times). Dave is straight, younger than me, and lives far away, he's like a little brother. The ‚Äúevidence‚Äù for cheating? Dave calls me ‚Äúbabe‚Äù as a joke, which he does with all of his friends. Chris knew this before we even got together. Dave and I talked, and he said he thought I hated him because I hadn‚Äôt reached out in a while‚Äî I didn‚Äôt feel like I was allowed to. When I told Dave the entire story and about feeling guilty and wanting to apologize to Chris, he reacted the same way as my cousin: ‚ÄúOh HELL NAH, don‚Äôt go back. I‚Äôm begging you, don‚Äôt go back.‚Äù So, maybe I‚Äôm not the bad guy after all.

Now, I‚Äôm on the bus back to Chris‚Äô town, and I feel sick to my stomach. I‚Äôm scared that being there will make me weak, that I‚Äôll regret leaving and want to stay. Please tell me I‚Äôm not crazy and that I made the right choice by leaving. Right now, I feel like I might have made the wrong one. My brain knows I did the right thing, but my feelings are all over the place.



The late night message without the really personal parts:

I know that I made a mistake and that I wasn't good enough to you, as well as that lately I haven't been a good company, there were many problems, mom and dad, everything was upside down, I neglected you, I didn't speak to you as I should have and I am terribly sorry for that.

1ja5s82,It's been almost three months...,Pitiful_Bug6336,2,2025-03-13 06:30:33+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ja5s82/its_been_almost_three_months/,"This is my first time sharing and posting on Reddit, I apologize if this is a lot..
Not really sure how to start a topic like this but I guess I'll start with the small stuff and try to keep this from being a novel.
I am a 25 year old (male) and my relationship ended 3 months ago with my 31 year old (female) SO.

Things between us started out like most relationships do; Overwhelming joy, sensations of true love/intimacy and feeling like we finally found ""the one.""

Fast forward three months into our relationship, I started noticing sudden changes in my SO's behavior. The night I started noticing these shifts, her tense body language and cold shoulder responses to me indicated that there was something wrong. I approached her with what I noticed and sat down to talk with her. She was cold with her tone and quick to anger. Still confused as to why she was coming off this way towards me, I asked her ""what's wrong?"" She blew up on me.
""You still have all these girls on your social media pages and it's extremely suspicious, I went through all of my personal profiles and cleaned house. If you really loved me, you still wouldn't have these random girls in your friends lists.""

After hearing this, it was a gut punch. I trusted her and I felt like she trusted me but with what she told me, it pinched my mind.Trying to reassure her, I told her I had no problem with going on my pages and removing all of my ""female friends"" if that meant proving to her that she had nothing to worry about. Mind you, I had done nothing prior or in that moment to break her trust. I understand insecurities and that early on in a relationship it is agreeable to have them.

This was a small fight which led to more fights down the road. From a fight in one month, to one fight a week, to 3 arguments a day, to 3 days nonstop verbal abuse and silent treatment. Almost 95% of our fights had to do with her accusations of my actions and her viewpoints of me.
I could not be any more transparent than I was with her and I still don't understand to this day, why she never chose to trust me or have faith in our relationship.

At around 6 months in our relationship, we had just moved into a new apartment. The 3rd day that we were there, she started accusing me of cheating on her. Knowing that this never happened and that I full heartedly believe in monogamy, she threatened to end our relationship. No matter how hard I tried to reassure her, prove to her that she is wrong and tell her that I could not allow myself to perform infidelity, it had no use.
She was extreme with her verbal insults, immensely accusatory of things she thinks that I did and brutal with her belittling. She said ""I am done with this relationship and it's over. Go find someone else.""
She ended up leaving our apartment, for the whole day without answering her phone to my texts or calls. Distraught, I still had to continue forward with my day with this situation infecting my mind.
I had to DJ for a wedding that day so I couldn't dedicate my time to fixing this fight. The whole day, I had to bottle up my emotions, perform and create a joyful atmosphere for this wedding and be a witness to the romance happening in front of me. Meanwhile, my life is crushed and my heart hurting through every pump. When I had finally finished my job, I felt horribly lost, hopeless and lifeless, crying the whole way back to my apartment.

When I got to my apartment, she had came back. After unpacking all of my gear, I came into my living room and sat down across from her on the opposing couch. I broke down in front her and just kept asking why she felt this way and what did I do to make you feel this way. Her response ""you should already know and I don't want to be with you, I think you should leave.""
Hearing this, I felt absolutely numb and questioned myself what the point of living is anymore. 
I got up without saying a word from the couch, stared at her while tears rolled down my face and I pulled my handgun from my pocket and put it to my head. She froze as she stared at me with no expressions in her eyes and no concern on her face.
I'm this moment, I was one second away from ending my life, all because I felt like my life wasn't worth living if I wasn't with her. She told me to put the gun down and I didn't move. She then grabbed her phone and called my mom. My mom answered and asked what was going on. She told her that I had a gun to my head. If it wasn't for my mother and the fear I heard in her voice, I wouldn't be posting this today. I left the apartment and I stayed at my parents house that night and gave my handgun to my dad, promising that I would never do this again.

I made the decision to start therapy a week later, to try and understand myself and my situation better.

10 months in and it only got worse.
This was the first time a full day of disagreements, turning into an arguments led to my SO physically abusing me.
I had enough of the back and forth bickering and locked myself in my bedroom. A few hours passed and I unlocked the bedroom door, hoping that my SO was calmed down and ready to have a healthy talk about what had upset her. Instead, she came in with the same aggressive behavior and told me to get out of bed and go sleep on the couch. I had established my position and place in the bedroom and told her I was not going anywhere and that her hostile behavior needed to change. Unphased, she circled around our bed, grabbing at me, pulling the sheets off of me and screaming in face to get out or she was going to hit me. As I backed up against the headboard, clutching at my phone recording this incident, she climbed ontop of the bed and repeatedly tried grabbing my phone out of my hand. She finally managed to grab my phone and threw it.
She then threw her fist straight into my left eye, punched me hard enough to where my vision went blurry. Struggling to get out from underneath her, I managed to wrap my arms around her shoulders and pin her back to the head board telling her stop and that I was not going to let her hit me again. After 5 seconds, I let go and immediately grabbed my phone and left the room. I heard her start crying while I left the room and went straight downstairs to the living room. 20 minutes past and she had come downstairs to the front door when I heard loud knocking coming from. She opened the door and 3 sheriff's had arrived. She called the cops and had told them about the incident that occured.

I was on the phone with my mom when this happened and I told her what was going on. The sheriff's approached me and asked me to come outside to talk about the situation. I did not hang up with my mom and put my phone in my pocket. Completely flustered and distraught, I was crying and in shock with what just happened, trying not to  believe that my SO would do this to me. The sheriff's were very aggressive towards me while they asked their questions. They were also asking my SO what happened inside my apartment at the same time.
After telling them 3 times what had happened, I told them I recorded the event on my phone. They asked to see it right away and I pulled my phone out of my pocket and my mother had still been on the call the whole hour I was outside. She heard everything the police had to say. I had to hang up on her and I showed them the video. Their tone with me changed in an instant and I no longer felt aggression from the authorities, rather it was support. After this, another 20 minutes went by and they finished with their report. They suggested that I should find another place to stay for the night but that I was more than welcome to stay at my apartment. I agreed with their suggestion and one sheriff offered to help me pack some clothes, food for my dog and my belongings. He then helped me bring them out to my car and said that they had the rest of the night handled and to get to my parents safely. A few nights went by and my SO and I discussed this incident. I had talked to my parents and close friends about this and they suggested that I end this relationship because it is not healthy. I told them that I still love her and that I believed that turning the other cheek, like Jesus was what I gave myself as an excuse to forgive my SO.

This situation repeated and happened two more times.

The second incident happened without the cops being called and involved, where my lip was busted and I was forced out of my apartment.
The third time, the last time, she punched me again in the face and clawed at my chest. The cops got involved with this and it was moments before I had to leave for work. This was also the last moment I held my son before my EX-SO took off and moved to another city to live with her mom.

Throughout all of this, my SO was pregnant with our son. She blamed her behavior and lack of control over her emotions on her hormones, sleep deprivation and post partum. Regardless, it continued even after her pregnancy. We are no longer together and our relationship ended 3 months ago.
She took my son with her and lives in another city, 120 miles away from me.

I filed a parenting plan 3 days after we broke up and she was served 8 days after I filed my petition and proposed parenting plan. I have not had one peaceful conversation with her since. When she moved, she started rumors and falsehood all over social media about me and my actions. Knowing that nothing she has been saying and claiming is true, she continues with this detrimental behavior towards me. The worst part, I have not seen or been with my son in 3 months. This is primarily due to her gatekeeping and withholding our son from me. This is alienation.

I cannot reach out to her because she has me blocked on all forms of communication. Even further, she has randomly and periodically unblocked me to harass me and further hurt my heart with false promises to go back to blocking me once again.

The worst part is that even throughout all this damage, I miss my Son beyond comprehension of words and I fail my own heart mind, still thinking and feeling that I love her and feel my heart crush itself over and over, knowing that I will never be close to her again.

1ja5omq,I don‚Äôt know why I keep going back,ZealousidealTale196,2,2025-03-13 06:23:11+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ja5omq/i_dont_know_why_i_keep_going_back/,"Boyfriend (34M) is emotionally and physically abusive to me (34F) and I don‚Äôt know how to leave. 

1. He blames me for everything including things like his cocaine/alcohol addiction problems that he had before he met me. Said it was my fault that he relapsed twice. 

2. Publicly humiliates me. Wants to FaceTime me so that everyone can hear him screaming at me. Calls me every name in the book. 

3. Has broken my iPhone several times (did not replace them or pay me back) and has tried to damage my car. Has even damaged an Airbnb property once and I was forced to pay for the damages. 

4. Has physically hurt me on multiple occasions, but because he did not use his fists, he says it doesn‚Äôt count as a hit. He once pulled my hair in front of kids. The mother of his kids had to call me to tell me that he‚Äôs physically hurt her too when they were dating and she‚Äôs sad that he‚Äôs continuing the cycle. 

5. Always screams at me if I am not doing something he approves of. Thinks that his opinion is the only thing that matters. I told him that my body is starting to respond to him in a way that I feel lost, numb, I‚Äôm becoming forgetful and uneasy. I started hanging up on him or if we are in the car, I‚Äôll just get out if we are in a stop sign. It‚Äôs never a good idea when I do it but I feel like I need to for my sanity. 

6. I can‚Äôt hang out with my friends and family and I am not allowed to be alone. I work from home but I am not allowed to go to my work office and if I do he‚Äôs constantly FaceTiming me and if I don‚Äôt answer him, he threatens to come to the office. 

7. Always accusing me of cheating and because I have a child from a previous relationship he‚Äôs always accusing me of being with my daughter‚Äôs father. If I don‚Äôt answer my phone he‚Äôs always assuming that I am having sex with someone else. 

8. Always ruins holidays, birthdays, special occasions etc. Today was our 2nd year anniversary and he refused to spend time with me because he no longer sees me as a potential wife. (I feel relieved but knowing his patterns idk if I am in the clear yet)

9. Bad mouths me to his friends and family as if I am the one constantly hurting him. But acts like this ‚Äúgood‚Äù guy in front of his family and strangers. Says it‚Äôs my fault that he has to treat me like crap because he doesn‚Äôt treat other people like that. 

10. Intimidates me if I chose to leave him. Will call me non-stop and shows up to my house if I try to block him. I‚Äôve had the cops come once but it didn‚Äôt do much. He cries and begs me to take him back. But then the moment he has me, he‚Äôs back to mistreating me, then breaks up with me again for any little reason. It‚Äôs almost as if he needs the control of being the one to break up with me. 

Despite all this, I find myself yearning for him. I feel sick thinking that the person who I hate the most, I want to be with the most. I don‚Äôt know how to get out. I know I don‚Äôt like how I feel when I am with him, but when he‚Äôs not around I miss him. This has morbidly messed up my brain. I never had an abusive relationship until I met this man. 

I understand I am at fault for constantly allowing him to come back.

1ja4ovo,"Problem with my boyfriend ""jokingly"" choking me",cycas-cycad,16,2025-03-13 05:13:21+00:00,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ja4ovo/problem_with_my_boyfriend_jokingly_choking_me/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 1 year, living together for 6 months. We've had a lot of problems with him crossing boundaries and I'll admit he has gotten better, but only after it gets to the point where I almost break up with him.

A little more context, we speak different languages, we know each other's language but we're not fluent. And I plan on moving to his county at the end of the year, but I've been planning on moving there even before I met him. 

The most recent problem is 4 days ago he jokingly grabbed my neck and pretended to choke me. It wasn't hard enough that it hurt and that I couldn't breathe, but hard enough to scare me. I have trauma with choking, so as soon as he did it I told him very clearly ""don't do that"" and ""I don't like that"".

I thought that would have been enough, but later that day he did it again in the parking lot before we went grocery shopping. I again told him not to do that and he asked ""why, do you have trauma? Who was it? I'll fight them"" (which I know was a joke because he doesn't  fight) I didn't want to unload right before entering the store so I just told him to let it go. 

Yesterday I was about to initiate sex, I was on top of him and once again he did it. So I walked away, and as I left he told me not to be so sensitive. Then when he realized how mad I was he apologized. And I told him if he does it one more time I will break up with him and he agreed not to do it again.

So the past day I didn't talk to him much because I was thinking about what I wanted to say and how to explain to him how serious that action was. Today we argued for about an hour and he said he played around pretending to choke me because I didn't tell him why I didn't like it, so he didn't  think I was serious. And I explained that I shouldn't have to give a reason, telling him I don't like being touched a certain way and that it makes me uncomfortable should be enough for him not to do it. 

The conversation spiraled into him saying that I'm accusing him of being a bad person and that he's not good enough for me, and that I should just find a better man. And this is how all of our conversations go when I'm trying to tell him how I feel and trying to figure out how to resolve things.

I do want this relationship to work because when we're not arguing and everything is good I couldn't imagine myself without him. But he's just so stubborn and I don't know how to get through to him and make him realize the things he says and does can be seen as abusive.

1ja4m3h,How bad are these messages?,Fran87412,20,2025-03-13 05:08:14+00:00,32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ja4m3h,"I feel like I‚Äôm perpetually stuck in a loop of always coming back to doubting. I‚Äôm so sick of it. I just want to be done. It‚Äôs like my brain defaults and tries to undo progress made. It will tell me I‚Äôm just being too sensitive. Or want to garner sympathy as a victim. Like imposter syndrome or something. And I wonder, if you haven‚Äôt really known a healthy relationship, is it just really hard to see how bad a bad one is?

I don‚Äôt want to call something abuse if it‚Äôs not, though I‚Äôve done my homework and see the patterns. So I organized ‚Äúreceipts‚Äù that I could come back to whenever I doubt (please be nice, I‚Äôd like to think this is a safe space, but I fear some people might think I‚Äôm crazy for compiling receipts). 

Photo 1 is some mean things they said to me. Photo 2 are some back to back messages I felt exemplified what would contribute to cognitive dissonance.

Part of me is always afraid I‚Äôm in the wrong for thinking it‚Äôs abusive. TIA for any perspectives, especially contrasting to healthy relationship dynamics or identifying abusive dynamics if present!

I know I cannot stop the wave of sadness building in the distance. I can see it readying itself to crash into the break...but I won't be there when it does. I will walk away from the rocky coast line, leaving him to weather things alone. 
Small peices break away from my already cracked and fragile heart as I go. It's been torn open and patched up too many times to count, some cuts deeper than others....it will never look the same. I will always see the marks he made and be reminded that he was never able to fully heal what he broke. I won't always feel them though. One day I will look at my oddly shaped heart and smile, knowing I healed what he couldn't...I'll be grateful that I learned how to protect it from ever being cut so deeply again. I'll be gentle with it, like he should have been.

I'm one day away from leaving and it feels so heavy tonight so I wrote and cried...then cried more....",2025-03-13 03:20:46,2025-03-17 02:12:47,all_new_posts

Do I utilize the no cost lawyer I found and just file for divorce and hope he doesn‚Äôt come home and break all my stuff? Do I hope he doesn‚Äôt decide to put a hand on me for the first time? Our current agreement is I am at our home during the week. He is supposed to be at our home on the weekends. We have 2 kids I watch during the week. 

This past weekend he was out of town so we haven‚Äôt gotten to try this out yet. I‚Äôm also pretty scared to leave the kids with him at all (look at prior posts, specifically my first one). I‚Äôm debating just staying at our home while he is here so his time with the kids is still supervised. 

I anticipate he will be a different person once I file and he is notified. I am afraid of the calls he will make and the limits he will go to in order to show me how hurt he is. In order to control me. 

My main concern is I have secured a no cost lawyer and I don‚Äôt expect the lawyer to just keep sitting around waiting for me to file. I feel like I need to file for divorce rather soon. I have not heard from the lawyer yet personally they have not reached out but I plan to call tomorrow. 

He has told me he will start looking for other places but is concerned how long it will take due to not having any savings. He has told me he will go with me to get a custody agreement notarized at the end of the week, in which I will have them during the week and he gets supervised time on the weekends. I don‚Äôt know if I can trust his word but this is what he says.   

Advice? Do I just file and hope for the best at this point? Wait until we have the custody order notarized? I have no money to my name so if I lose this lawyer for waiting too long, I‚Äôm kind of screwed. ",2025-03-13 00:49:30,2025-03-17 02:12:53,all_new_posts
1j9zmjq,My Sister Reconciled with her Extremely Toxic Ex-Boyfriend,Delicious-Bake-7049,1,2025-03-13 00:40:11+00:00,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j9zmjq/my_sister_reconciled_with_her_extremely_toxic/,"Just as the title entails, after nearly 6 years of being apart from him (with no contact) and supposedly healing. She's fallen for the same lies yet again. At first she had lied about who she had been seeing this whole time to me and my mother, as she knew how we would both react. She lied about the name, where they met, how they met etc. She made up such an extravagant lie just to keep her relationship with him a secret. Before she admitted anything, I had actually found out myself she was back with him two months ago, after I asked to use her phone to order something on her Amazon Prime account and seen an inappropriate text from him under his name pop up on the screen. I can't explain how I felt in the moment. I wasn't even sad, just disappointed. My sister had chosen to be celibate to be more closer to God after they had broken up all those years ago. To see that text and knowing she broke it for him, disgusts me. I didn't confront my sister or tell my mother at the time, I kept it to myself as it had to be my sister to tell her.

Cut to a few days ago, he received his food stamp card and offered to buy us groceries. My mother, still believing him to the person she's made up the whole time, says she'd like to meet him since he's offering to do such a nice gesture and that's when she finally came out and confessed who he really was. I had never seen my mother so distraught in my entire life, there was no consoling her. My sister is her first born and she just couldn't believe after all the pain, humiliation, the cheating, lies and even him almost ruining her credit, that'd she still give him another chance. But for whatever reason my sister wholeheartedly believes that he's changed and that God has shown him the way.

Despite her denials, I can see she's falling back into her old habits. Going out of her way for him every step of the process. Doing his laundry, letting him use her work issued public transport debit card, taking time off work to be with him. Anything he needs, she gives.

He used to live in his own apartment with a roommate but had soon gotten evicted, then he moved in with his brother for about a month or so. Got kicked out due to his brother's manipulative tendencies(Or at least that's what he told her). Currently, he's homeless and living in a shelter after much of his family, according to her abandoned him. And she feels bad because in her words ""he has no one else to turn to.""

So far, ever since she confessed the news, my mother has been so depressed. She barely comes out of her room unless she's doing chores or going to work. She barely speaks any words to my sister. My sister actually had the nerve to ask my mom if he could stay to take a nap for a few hours since his shelter puts them out for a few hours until they're allowed to come back. My mother has since disowned her. In her own words she stated that ""their relationship is done."" Now I'm just caught in the middle, working out how I feel.

I should note that both me and my mother have also gone through our own experiences of toxic and abusive relationships and we have luckily gotten away. I want my sister to be happy but I also have to look at the facts, no matter how much someone has changed there's just no possible way to build trust in them again. If they've abused you once, they'll do it again.",2025-03-13 00:40:11,2025-03-17 02:12:54,all_new_posts
1j9zcde,unsure if this can be considered some form of abuse,suprisedpikachumeme,1,2025-03-13 00:26:59+00:00,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j9zcde/unsure_if_this_can_be_considered_some_form_of/,"(reposted because i‚Äôm not sure if anyone saw my last post) 

I (17f) was in an online relationship/friendship with a girl i‚Äôll refer to as J (16F), i met J in around late 2020 or early 2021 when i was 13 years old, we started dating a couple months later when i was 14. I broke up with her when i was 16, but i stayed friends with her until a few days ago.

it‚Äôs a very long and confusing story, but i‚Äôll explain in the shortest way possible. 

I noticed some things when we were dating that were kind of red flags to me. at the time i had a habit of venting to J about a specific friend group instead of communicating with my friend group, when i vented to J she‚Äôd tell me to leave that group. i was having trust issues about that friend group (which were completely irrational, by the way. i was just overthinking and didn‚Äôt handle it the right way.) but i didn‚Äôt wanna leave the friend group. J convinced me to leave the friend group on two occasions (first time, J told me she‚Äôd leave someone who harmed her if i left that friend group. second time, she told me that leaving them would be her ‚Äúbest christmas present‚Äù, when i expressed that i missed the friend group, she acted really disappointed in me.) J would also say really ableist things. she once said ‚Äúpeople who can‚Äôt count money are *slur for mentally disabled people that i don‚Äôt want to say*‚Äù even though she KNOWS i can‚Äôt do that, but  she said i was the ‚Äúexception‚Äù. she would also kinda‚Ä¶ brag? about doxxing people.

december 2023 to september 2024, i was receiving anonymous harassment on and off. whoever was harassing me would use very personal stuff against me, so i knew it was someone i knew personally. It was even more apparent that it was someone i had known when someone texted my phone number (again, with personal info that only 2 people would‚Äôve known about) 

the other day, i found out that most of this harassment during that time came from J herself. i also found out that J told one of her ex friends that she wanted to isolate me from my friends in order for me to rely solely on her, J also told this ex friend that she ‚Äúliked watching me be upset‚Äù, and apparently dated me as a joke. she made up so many lies about me, J even accused me of something so horrid, despite knowing i have trauma about the exact thing i was accused of. 


J told me lies about this ex friend before, the same lies she told the ex friend about me, and i wasn‚Äôt allowed to talk to this ex friend (the ex friend and i had some issues, the ex friend wanted to explain this stuff to me but since J told me she‚Äôd block me if i spoke to the ex friend, i didn‚Äôt hear the friend out. I only messaged the ex friend because i found out J was harassing her as well.) after talking to the ex friend, i blocked J on everything. i feel a little bit bad and i‚Äôm doubting myself about my decision. my mother and multiple friends were telling me this didn‚Äôt seem right back when i was dating J, and my old therapist even called J an abuser 

i‚Äôm wondering if this can be considered abusive in any way. reading this back, i don‚Äôt think it was and i kinda feel stupid for posting this. i‚Äôm sorry if this is confusing. ",2025-03-13 00:26:59,2025-03-17 02:12:55,all_new_posts

I left my abuser recently, and his voice haunts me on a minute-by-minute basis. One of his main ‚Äúissues‚Äù with me was that I am ‚Äúconstantly seeking validation from men‚Äù and that my ‚Äúbody language‚Äù and the way I behave and dress in public shows him, and everyone else in the world, that I need attention and validation from men. Therefore, I disrespected him constantly throughout our entire relationship. He often used this as an excuse for his anger and abuse. He has said to me many times I don‚Äôt deserve respect because of the way I act, and no man will ever want to be with someone like me. I‚Äôll spare the grim details, but he‚Äôs called me every name in the book and screamed at, belittled, coerced and intimidated me on a daily basis. I started to really believe him. 

I tend to be bubbly, extremely relational, and enjoy chatting people up (although these traits have all been beaten down to a pulp and are now completely absent). I guess some could interpret this as ‚Äúflirty‚Äù, but his accusations and abuse surrounding my personality have left me perplexed, hurt, and in a dangerous thought spiral believing that I am and was a horrible partner.

1j9w7m2,Unsure how to proceed,Relevant-Judgment583,3,2025-03-12 22:06:33+00:00,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j9w7m2/unsure_how_to_proceed/,"New account for obvious anonymity reasons. I've not typed this out before so I'll try to be descriptive without giving myself away.

My husband and I have been together for almost 20 years. We met online when I was 16 through a game. He was around 24. By the time I was 18, I moved overseas to be with him.

He had assured me that I had a job lined up - it was my one caveat to moving. I had made it clear that I never wanted to be a stay-at-home partner. When I got there, I found that it had been false.

Several years later, despite my birth control pills, I became pregnant. Originally, I didn't want it, but it was too late to abort so we went through with it and made things work. We were still living with his parents. We got married shortly before I gave birth. Almost two years later (being overseas for around 7 years by this point), I had the chance to borrow some money from a family member to move back to my original country with him and our child, to which he was excited and agreed as finances and recession had become a struggle in his country.

We were happy, nothing appeared wrong. We moved back to my previous country, I started studies to regain a foothold into the workforce as I had been out of it for seven years. He took a freelance job working from home. Money was very tight but we were making our little family work.

Over time, things changed. I grew, I got a degree and stepped into the workforce. He remained home with our child and his part time freelance job, which slowly became more full time. He didn't earn a lot, and I earned a little more, but we were slowly paying debt from the move and coming into ourselves.

Several years later, he got a full-time job in an office doing what he really enjoyed. He hated the town we were in but said he stayed for us and that he knew our finances were much better in this country. The office ended up being a very toxic environment, however, and one year later his role was disestablished and he was made redundant. Unrelated to his predicament (primarily due to covid struggles of small businesses), I was also made redundant from my job.

Emotions ran high, we were both stressed, but I managed to gather the money and move us a few hours away to a place he loved after I got another job a few months later. I thought it would ease his stress, and despite his struggles finding another job, he ended up going back to his old freelance work.

I thought he would find something better but he did not. I begged him to go to therapy as I watched him crumble - he had attempted to unalive himself during redundancy. I had been to therapy for about a year and been diagnosed and medicated with several mental health issues, which he claimed were not real. He said he preferred me off my medication, and I was not the girl he married. He started getting emotionally distant, abusive. Days of silent treatment and brooding, and punching furniture and throwing objects around when he got upset.

My friends have told me for years I am in an abusive relationship. I read a book from the library called Invisible Wounds and he got angry at the idea when he appeared to match all characteristics of a covert narcissist.

This Christmas past, he got really bad. He eventually apologised after I told him I was leaving with our child. He has started going to therapy, but I'm worried because despite all of the concerns I told the therapist in private, the therapist has seemed to dismiss it in favour of giving my husband a referral for ADHD instead.

He takes no responsibility for actions. He does not know how to cook or drive, or do basic adult tasks. He completely shuts down when I try to explain my feelings, getting defensive and claiming I'm blaming him for things when all I am trying to do is describe how I feel.

Something small as an example from just last night. He seems to really get upset if I go to bed earlier than him. I get up at 6am for work, he gets up around 11-12. He always seems disappointed and incredulous as he asks ""What? You're going to bed already?"" when I tell him I am going to bed around 10pm. I tried to tell him my thoughts and feelings politely and clearly. He came up and sat on the bed as I was in bed. I asked him what he was up to because he sat quietly for a while. He said he ""didn't want to become one of those people going to bed at 9 or 10"" as he's always said. I told him he had no obligation to, explained my early start times, and that I understood that he got upset if I went to bed early but it wasn't sustainable for me to go to bed as late as him, as it meant I only got four or five hours of sleep per night. He told me he doesn't get upset and I can go to bed whenever I want. I told him I do go to bed whenever I want and explained that he does get upset, he acts incredulous and disappointed every time I do, and he said he felt like he was being told off. I told him I was just explaining my feelings and that I wasn't saying anything negative, just how I felt, and he did his... I don't know how to explain it. He shuts his eyes and fists really tight and rolls his head as if his neck hurts, and then walked out. He stonewalls me every time.

I'm afraid I may have said enough to give me away if he finds this, though he isn't one to browse Reddit. I have small clip recordings, texts, messages. But it's all from my point of view too. I can't seem to explain to the therapist how bad it is, and I know I've repeatedly been told to leave, but he is in another country alone. I am also aware that it's ""not my responsibility"" but I am doing my best, yet again, to make this work. He waits until I seem to be ""fine"" again and then he goes back to his old self. I am also aware that, despite his passionate claims that he would never hurt me physically, there is always a chance. I am physically sick from the emotional toil it is taking, and I struggle to get into work every day. If I work from home, he seems irritated and claims that I'll ""get fired if I'm not careful"". I believe he is projecting his own insecurities on me for that, and other things.

TLDR: I am financially capable of walking away, but not mentally. I have repeatedly attempted to help him over the years but he keeps reverting back. I understand that I can't help someone who won't help themselves, but there's an invisible blocker in my head and heart that stops me from doing the logical thing. I am unsure what to do, how to explain it all to the authorities or even who to explain it to, and feel guilty about sometimes wishing something would happen to him to make it easier for me and our child.",2025-03-12 22:06:33,2025-03-17 02:14:02,all_new_posts

It's gotten even worse since then, with her flying into a rage every morning about something I did or didn't do. Yesterday it was because I had forgotten to light the mosquito coils by the back door. The day before it was because I had been playing with our son rather than washing the dishes (of which there were about three dirty plates). Shes yelled point blank that I ""disgust"" her and that she ""hates"" me. It's exhausting and distressing, and if it was just me, I'd have left long ago.

But we have a 3yo child who I adore and he adores me. I spend basically every moment outside of work caring and raising him. We even coslept together. But for the past few months my wife has been accusing me of being an unfit and negligent parent. Her reasons, in my opinion, are trivial, like missing a patch of skin while applying sunscreen or packing the wrong coloured hat in his daycare bag, but she considers my errors life-endangering, either because she is neurotic or because she's intentionally trying to position herself as the primary carer if we seperate.

The thought of having to stay in a hostile relationship fills me with dread, but the thought of only seeing my son half the week or less is worse. My worst nightmare is that I move out a my wife cuts off all contact between me and my son. I don't have the money to take her to court, and even if I did, a trial could take months or even years, by which time my son might not even recognise me.

Anyway, I dont expect anyone to have a solution. I just thought I'd share, and maybe give some insight into why some people stay in abusive or unhappy relationships. Thanks.",2025-03-12 19:57:45,2025-03-17 02:14:04,all_new_posts

I‚Äôm not going to give much info about myself because I‚Äôm still a little scared, but for the last 2 years I‚Äôve been in a really toxic relationship with someone who used to be my best friend. He‚Äôs never persay hit me, but he has called me horrible names, screamed in my face, thrown and broken my stuff, and most recently I realized I was actually being abused because he tried to charge at me with a tool in an attempt to scare me/hit me. He claims he wasn‚Äôt going to hit me but it was truly terrifying. 

He made me dependent on him financially under the guise of just me never having to work again because I ‚Äúdeserved that‚Äù, and has used his wealth as an advantage over me because he told me he doesn‚Äôt believe anyone else would ‚Äúdeal with me‚Äù long enough to give me this kind of lifestyle (expensive cars, multiple houses, 3-4 vacations a year, luxury bags, shoes, etc).

It‚Äôs taken me a very very long time to accept that what‚Äôs happening and what has happened to me is abuse, and tonight I‚Äôm finally leaving for good. It‚Äôs been so relieving and also so scary to restart, I truly love him but I cannot keep putting myself through infidelity, verbal abuse, emotional abuse, gaslighting, and all of the short and long term effects of this. Please wish me luck. Also if you‚Äôre going through any of this please try to exit safely, you‚Äôre worth way more than this.",2025-03-12 14:56:24,2025-03-17 02:14:15,all_new_posts

Last few weeks have been *great*, like actually great.  My wife is happy, she's ecstatic to plan this big family vacation (which I'm happily helping with), she's all jokes and smiles and sharing dumb things she found on the Internet and generally the reason I married her.  Hell, we even fooled around a few nights ago for the first time in 2025.  

Yesterday, it started.  Wagon was left out by the garage, so it was my fault the kid almost had a meltdown leaving for school because he wanted to go for a ride instead (the wagon always gets left out, including by her).  I was sitting on the floor gaming for like 30 minutes after spending a couple hours getting the house picked up.  That glass and XBOX remote?  I've left it on the floor a couple times before (which is synonomous with ""always""), better not do it again tonight.  Oh, you kept the laundry running?  You needed to put that rug through the wash a second time, now it's your fault if dog pee smell gets locked in.

On and on throughout the day with the *little* things, enough to put me back on eggshells in case I'd started to get comfortable again.  Enough to make me second guess everything I do, enough to make me think ""fuck, what else did I get wrong?"" when she enters the room.",2025-03-12 14:52:15,2025-03-17 02:14:16,all_new_posts

As of yesterday @11:30am there was no record of him submitting an affidavit. 
My council will be asking for 1 year extension and police escort to retrieve items left behind and return items to him inadvertently packed.
My horse  can not be added and because I don't want address noted, the epo can't include him in any way.( EXTREMELY  relevant as he brutally beat one of the 2 cats, I have survelance video proof, and I don't for one second doubt he will try to make, attack, kill my horse,  he KNOWS  it would destroy me)
It all depends on the justice presiding. 
IF he doesn't show, it could be 100% in my favor OR he could be granted extension to submit affidavit. 
I am attending virtually. 
Please pray üôè",2025-03-12 14:44:17,2025-03-17 02:14:19,all_new_posts
1j9l7ex,Mod Post: What to Do if You Receive Creepy/Inappropriate Messages via This Sub,Ebbie45,25,2025-03-12 14:21:16+00:00,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j9l7ex/mod_post_what_to_do_if_you_receive/,"Hi all, unfortunately a few members lately have been reporting to us that they've received inappropriate messages from strangers via Reddit DM after posting here.

While I believe on the whole this is *rare,* it still happens. The unfortunate reality is that any sub specifically for abuse victims probably receives a higher proportion of such messages than other subs because, well, there are really nasty creeps out there.

**If you do receive an inappropriate DM after posting in our sub, please reach out to us mods to report it [via modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/abusiverelationships) and we can permanently ban the individuals in question.**

**If the messages you receive are graphic, violent, threatening, harassing, or prejudiced in any way, please also consider reporting them to the reddit admins. The admins are the paid employees who run this site and sometimes they can take additional action beyond what mods can. Mods can only remove members from the subs they mod. Admins can sometimes permanently suspend users' accounts from all of reddit. Use www.reddit.com/report for this. Click ""I want to report spam or abuse"" then the abusive/harassing option, and then choose whatever options fit your situation best.**

Much love, and I'm so sorry to anyone this happens to <3",2025-03-12 14:21:16,2025-03-17 02:14:20,all_new_posts

He was in the wrong as well hence the warning. 

He compared them in the way I see my abuser daily at work and how he thinks about the warning every day, how they‚Äôre both ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù but we can ignore and move past. 

I am so upset he would water it down like that and compare it to something that he was genuinely in the wrong for. Of course he should feel pressure, he did the wrong thing. I should not be fearful in my workplace because of my abuser. 

In the same breath I miss my abuser and this conversation with my friend makes me want to reach out again all the more. The more isolated I feel the more I want to return to the cycle again. I have pondered writing a letter and giving it to my abuser. I have so much I would want to say. 

My friend has really upset me by simplifying my issue at work into something I should just get over‚Ä¶. I am a changed person and it affects every part of my life my brain and body is changed because of this situation. Maybe my friend is not so good either‚Ä¶. I just feel so isolated ",2025-03-12 14:02:51,2025-03-17 02:14:21,all_new_posts

I‚Äôve been knowing that for years now but whenever we talk about it there‚Äôs always some kind of agreement that we come to that makes it feel better in the moment. It‚Äôs almost never followed through with though. He claims it‚Äôs me not following though and I claim it‚Äôs him.

He left after I just finished battling a months-long depression. His explanation was he didn‚Äôt want to take care of me and ‚Äúresented me‚Äù  for trying to ‚Äúput my health in between him and his needs.‚Äù He also initiated the break up three days after my grandparents passed away. 

From the beginning I entered therapy to not burden him; i got on medication and even had my mom help me while he was away on a work trip. It was my first time dealing with mental health issues like this and it was scary for me, but no matter how much I tried to  alleviate him of responsibility it didn‚Äôt matter. The end of our relationship was plagued by gaslighting and stonewalling. He called me names and made me feel so alone and crazy. I thought I was losing my mind. 

Two days after he left he took our dog and never let me see him again because ‚Äúhe makes more money than me and I have no family in the city we live in.‚Äù Immediately after this he met and started dating a fan of his band and started dressing completely different. Despite my pleas for an explanation or closure, he never spoke to me again. I found out a month ago he gave our dog away to his mom shortly after we broke up. 

I‚Äôm in therapy, I‚Äôm practicing self care, and I‚Äôm thankfully surrounded by a wonderful community of friends. But I‚Äôm still so paralyzed. I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around why he treated me so poorly and the memories of what he did make me feel so ashamed. Ashamed because I can‚Äôt believe I let him treat me this way‚Ä¶ and ashamed because part of me still believes him. 

If anyone can please help me or give me advice on what to do, or at least reassure me 6 months is not too long. I get so depressed sometimes thinking about everything that I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I also miss my dog, and I still haven‚Äôt really had the strength to process my grandparents‚Äô deaths. I‚Äôm trying to save myself but it feels like I‚Äôm just not strong enough.
