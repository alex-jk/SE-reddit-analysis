1e3zxod,"My boyfriend leaves me bruises to mark his territory, is this the beginning of serious abuse?",Hot_Independence863,350,329,https://i.redd.it/w4opuvx9rpcd1.jpeg,"Sorry for the unclear picture but I am afraid of being recognized but my closest ones.

This is a picture of my side butt, my boyfriend tends to mark his territory and this is what he did last night. He is not the aggressive type in general, he is quite sweet and affectionate towards me, but that’s how he explains the bruises he leaves me, “I love to mark you so you think about me”
I think this is getting out of hand. How am I supposed to go to the beach, for example?
I have several also on my arms, legs. And whenever he sees bruises he asks me how and where did I get them from, I feel like this is him displaying his possession over me and I think this could grow into something else.

Anyone with similiar experience?

Thank you. ",2024-07-15 16:59:50,2025-03-17 03:18:55,abuse

He was always against me getting tertiary education and prevented me from getting a job. He was a high school dropout.

Examples of things he said that made me realise how pathetic he was:

- He thought that iPhone and Apple are not connected- that both are seperate companies. When I corrected him, he started a fight and said that I was belittling him. I said that it is just a common knowledge. His response: “I don’t belittle you for not knowing who plays in FC Barcelona”.

- When he heard about Croatia, he asked ‘What is that’

- He believed all laws are unnecessary and that the government should be changed into a private-run company.

I sometimes like to think about these things, it makes me remember that many abusers are mouth breathers and they abuse because the violence is the only that they can do.",2025-02-03 07:19:10,2025-03-17 03:19:03,abuse

1grr6mw,"I finally spoke publically about my ex's abuse, and today he killed himself",tthrowaway1234567890,359,113,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1grr6mw/i_finally_spoke_publically_about_my_exs_abuse_and/,"I dated him for 3.5 years, lived with him for 3.

Now, Two years later, I've come to the realization that I was in an abusive relationship with my ex. Around the same time, a few girls reached out to me asking about his suspicious behavior. I had started posting on my Instagram story (about 5 posts in one month) hinting that my ex was emotionally manipulative during our relationship, saying that other women before and after me accused him of rape and assault, and sending people a synopsis of his actions to me in private messages when they reached out. 

This morning I got the message that he killed himself. 

6 days before my birthday. 

While I'm on a trip in the city we last took a trip to together before splitting. 

I'm going to leave out the details of my emotions, but just know this has absolutely destroyed my soul and will affect me for the rest of my life. 

Today Someone sent me a message of a screenshot of him saying how I single-handedly ruined his entire life and he knows how happy I am about it. My logical mind knows it's not my fault. He has had mental health issues for many years that he never addressed. I tried my best to help while we were together. I got him free therapy at my job, called 988 a few times with him, and hid all the knives in the house after he locked himself in the bathroom with one. I never ever brought him down, I would do my best to shower him in compliments constantly to try to lift his spirits when he was sad, because I genuinely loved him at the time. I only held him accountable for his abuse against me. 

I don't know yet if he left a note or anything. someone messaged me already how I pushed him to do this with and should feel guilty for destroying so many people's lives. His sister left me a pretty nasty voicemail  sarcastically asking what he did to abuse me and to ""have a nice fucking life"". I even got a nasty email from my ex gf that I haven't spoken to in 5 years. These imply to me that he left a note blaming me. None of these people know my side. Everyone else Ive talked to who knows my side has been telling me not to blame myself, and deep down I beliebe that but the guilt I feel is overwhelming right now.  I just know there's other people out there who think that I intentionally pushed him to do this. 

I have a lot of support from family and friends and already contacted my therapist to start sessions again the day I arrive home from my trip. 

I don't know why I'm posting this, I guess for advice and to vent and to see if anyone has been in a situation like this before. Thanks for reading.

1h1279c,What was the stupidest thing your abuser threw a tantrum over?,Working_Cow_7931,81,214,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1h1279c/what_was_the_stupidest_thing_your_abuser_threw_a/,"I've been in an angry phase for the last few weeks since leaving my emotionally and financially abusive relationship. 

But yesterday, I went on what might have been a date but might not have been (a guy I'd met through a meetup group I'd joined inivited me out with him, just for a walk) and I caught myself really  pining for my ex again. Only for the really loving side he had in between episodes where he'd wake me up stroking my hair with a cup of coffee or orange juice and run me baths for when I got home etc and the mug he got me for valentines day with a picture of us on. I know it sounds silly, but I've never had any other exs do those nice, loving things.

Then I started spiraling wondering if I'd made the right decision to leave and whether his reactions to minor things really were that over the top or if I just overreacted to his reactions and threw away what we had with all the lovely stuff in between.


He'd throw a strop over stuff like:

I left a knife and fork in a takeaway box
 
I left a juice carton on the table

I threw away a disposable wrapper

I paused to give way to traffic, which had right of way (he often wanted me to push in and risk an accident for the sake of not having to wait 30 seconds)

I forgot to put onions in a sandwich 

Things being out of place (e.g., a mug or a torch, and then the accusations that I'd stolen them would start when I didn't even know these items existed, let alone where they go, or where they've ended up)

I accidentally took the wrong exit at a roundabout (it only took about 2 minutes to turn around

I used a urine sample pot that was identical to all the others by mistake when that was 'his' one from the doctor (they were all completely indistinguishable and I always have some in the house as it recurrent uti and kidney infections and they were next to each other, there was absolutely no reason he couldn't have used one of the others)

Dropping things

Spilling things

I knocked over a glass of Pepsi, which was left on the floor

Not hanging his T-shirts 'the right way' on the airer (I could never remember what the right way was supposed to be, who even has a right way to do something so mundane and inconsequential?)

Forgetting to take the laundry out

I ate the last piece of bread and forgot to buy another loaf (apparently this warranted waking me up at 7am on my day off to go out and buy more for him, instead of doing so himself or just having something else for breakfast)

I didn't wake him up for an appointment that I didn't even know he had (he had an alarm clock, btw)

I didn't give him a back massage at 11pm when I had been up since 6am, ram a metric marathon race, and had to get up early for work the next day

There's so many more examples 


I was just wondering who can relate? Is this a common tactic to make you walk on eggshells? Was I overreacting when I got upset that he was shouting at me, accusing me of not caring about him?

I was out on a dinner date with my boyfriend last week and he told me he used to be very physically violent towards women and that he is not anymore. He said it has been several years since and that he has changed, but wants to be open with me. Sometimes he will playfully choke me if I say something that gets him a little upset, but he does it as a joke and not hard. We also got into a fight at his apartment a few weeks ago and he took my phone because I wanted to call someone to leave. I had to lock myself in the bathroom when I got the phone back so that he wouldn’t take it from me and I called someone to get me. 

He also routinely calls me crazy and I’m starting to believe it. I don’t know if this is a joke or if this is a part of his “plan” or something. He said I was crazy for leaving after the fight even though I left because I got scared and he was just saying real mean things.

Somehow turned into an argument he was getting super close to my face acting like he was going to hit me so I pushed him away many times until he actually hit me in the mouth then several times on the side of my head after. I screamed for him to leave and I threatened to call the police. He’s hit me before multiple times in the past but only when he was drunk so I forgave him after he decided to be sober. Now that I realize it’s not the alcohol it’s just him, he’s an abusive human being. I am heartbroken and I guess looking for words of encouragement. We planned on a trip to Bali in June that’s reserved and we did everything together. How can someone do that to you if they love you? How do they not grasp the horrible things they’ve done and stop right away? How can you hit someone in the fact repeatedly and not feel sorry? I didn’t call the cops but I do not plan on getting back with him. I am heartbroken and just thinking to myself “why?” ",2025-01-15 02:14:54,2025-03-17 03:19:13,abuse
1i7v41h,My Abuser Was A Mr. Sensitive.  I Promise You They Are Just As Destructive As Any Other Style Of Abuser,MissMoxie2004,234,92,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1i7v41h/my_abuser_was_a_mr_sensitive_i_promise_you_they/,"So I’ve seen a few posts on here coming from abuse victims who are a bit confused about what’s going on. They know their partner makes them feel overwhelmed and suffocated but otherwise don’t know how to describe what’s happening.  I recognize these thoughts and patterns.  What these victims are dealing with is a style of abuser Bancroft labeled “Mr. Sensitive.”

I won’t elaborate, but I will paste the passage on Mr. Sensitive from Why Does He Do That below.  My abuser was a Mr. Sensitive and I promise you they are just as destructive as any other style of abuser. 

Also, feel free to ask me ANYTHING

Mr. Sensitive from Why Does He Do That 

Mr. Sensitive appears to be the diametric opposite of the Drill Sergeant. He is soft-spoken, gentle, and supportive—when he isn't being abusive. He loves the language of feelings, openly sharing his insecurities, his fears, and his emotional injuries. He hugs other men. He may speak out about the absurdity of war or the need for men to get in touch with their feminine side. Perhaps he attends a men's group or goes on men's retreats. Often he has participated extensively in therapy or twelve-step programs, or reads all the big self-help books, so he speaks the language of popular psychology and introspection. His vocabulary is sprinkled with jargon like developing closeness, working out our issues, and facing up to hard things about myself. He presents himself to women as an ally in the struggle against sex-role limitations. To some women, he seems like a dream come true.

So what's wrong with this picture? Nothing obvious yet. But this is exactly the problem: Mr. Sensitive wraps himself in one of the most persuasive covers a man can have. If you start to feel chronically mistreated by him, you are likely to assume that something is wrong with you, and if you complain about him to other people, they may think you must be spoiled: You have the New Age man, what more do you want?

The following dynamics are typical of a relationship with Mr. Sensitive and may help explain your feeling that something has gone awry:

You seem to be hurting his feelings constantly, though you aren't sure why, and he expects your attention to be focused endlessly on his emotional injuries. If you are in a bad mood one day and say something unfair or insensitive, it won't be enough for you to give him a sincere apology and accept responsibility. He'll go on and on about it, expecting you to grovel as if you had treated him with profound cruelty. (Notice the twist here: This is just what an abuser accuses his partner of doing to him, when all she is really looking for is a heartfelt I'm sorry.)
When your feelings are hurt, on the other hand, he will insist on brushing over it quickly. He may give you a stream of pop-psychology language (Just let the feelings go through you, don't hold on to them so much, or It's all in the attitude you take toward life, or No one can hurt you unless you let them) to substitute for genuine support for your feelings, especially if you are upset about something he did. None of these philosophies applies when you upset him, however.
With the passing of time, he increasingly casts the blame on to you for anything he is dissatisfied with in his own life; your burden of guilt keeps growing.
He starts to exhibit a mean side that no one else ever sees and may even become threatening or intimidating.
Mr. Sensitive has the potential to turn physically frightening, as any style of abuser can, no matter how much he may preach nonviolence. After an aggressive incident, he will speak of his actions as anger rather than as abuse, as though there were no difference between the two. He blames his assaultive behavior on you or on his emotional issues, saying that his feelings were so deeply wounded that he had no other choice.

Many people reject the possibility that Mr. Sensitive could be an abuser. I ran into this disbelief one weekend when I was leading a training course on emotional recovery, as I periodically do. My workshops focus partly on the healing effects of crying and so tend to be attended by more women than men. The males who do come have included many of the most wonderful men it has been my good fortune to know, as well as a handful of the biggest manipulators. A few years ago, a participant named Deanna approached me anxiously before a workshop. She explained that an ex-partner of hers named Brad had called her a few days ahead of the workshop to tell her he was attending the same weekend. She was uncomfortable and told him that if he showed up she would leave. He promised not to bother her, though, and said he would not bring up their relationship in any way. He was coming with his new girlfriend, which eased Deanna's worries.

I spent some time talking with Brad as the workshop was starting, without mentioning Deanna, and he seemed likeable, kind, and—what can I say?—sensitive. However, I observed within a few hours that he was in fact speaking to other people about his past with Deanna and getting them riled up about her running away from their unresolved issues. On Sunday morning, he finally provoked a scene about their relationship in front of the full workshop, which was humiliating to Deanna.

The story does not end there. I called a break, and took Brad aside. I told him that it was my understanding that he had agreed not to raise these issues and that it had become obvious to me that he had come for the weekend with the intention of doing precisely what he had promised not to. I went on to point out that he had taken Deanna's weekend away from her and that I considered this kind of power move to be abuse, especially since it was directed at an ex-partner.

Saying the word abuse to an abusive person can be like lighting a tinderbox: When you name the unmentionable secret, he goes wild. Brad got loud, rolled his eyes at what a hysterical exaggerator he considered me to be, and adopted a victim stance, saying, I beg you to stop this. Then came the most important part: He said in a screeching whine, I have only put a hand on a partner once in my life, many years ago, and I just barely pushed her away from me like this—and he shoved me hard by the shoulder—after she called my mother a sick woman.

Well, why was Brad denying a history of assault (while actually admitting to one) when I hadn't said anything about violence? The possibility that he might be physically abusive had never occurred to me before, but it certainly did now. The signs were all there: bullying Deanna that weekend and then insisting it was for her own good; feeling entitled to ignore an important agreement; blaming his earlier girlfriend for his assault of her and minimizing it—the strength of the shove he gave me would have shaken up most women. I now doubted that the assaultive incident he had described was his only occasion of physically intimidating a woman.

At this point I required Brad to leave the workshop. I then had to deal with a mini-insurrection from some of the other workshop participants, who couldn't believe I was ejecting this gentle man who was so in touch with his feelings. He cries after all; how could he be abusive?

This gentle man style of abuser tends to be highly self-centered and demanding of emotional catering. He may not be the man who has a fit because dinner is late but rather erupts because of some way his partner failed to sacrifice her own needs or interests to keep him content. He plays up how fragile he is to divert attention from the swath of destruction he leaves behind him.

The central attitudes driving Mr. Sensitive are:

• I'm against the macho men, so I couldn't be abusive.

• As long as I use a lot of psychobabble, no one is going to believe that I am mistreating you.

• I can control you by analyzing how your mind and emotions work, and what your issues are from childhood.

• I can get inside your head whether you want me there or not.

• Nothing in the world is more important than my feelings.

• Women should be grateful to me for not being like those other men.",2025-01-23 04:13:52,2025-03-17 03:19:15,abuse

I (33F) am married to Rob (35M), and we have two kids—6 years old and 4 months. Rob has struggled with keeping a job for most of our 7-year relationship. He has an average job tenure of about 6 months before something happens—usually an issue with a boss or coworkers—that leads to him losing the job.

At the beginning of this year, Rob was unemployed, so he went to a remote northern community for work, leaving me at home. He tried to convince me to move there with him because he found a job he liked, but I refused. I was pregnant, didn’t want to move for his job, and our daughter is settled here. On top of that, our relationship wasn’t great. While he was away, he didn’t send any money home for the house or our kids.

Rob moved back home in August, and in September, he started a new job where he makes decent money. Since then, he sent me $600 from his first paycheck and $300 from his second. This doesn’t even come close to covering his portion of the bills. I asked him how much he was making so I could calculate his share, but he refused to tell me. He said he’s paying off his credit card and saving for school. Then this text threat ensued. Can you please read this and let me know if he is out of line.

A little backstory:
I was up all night (til 7am) like I am often because we have puppies and senior dogs that need frequent potty breaks and attention. I also have schoolwork to do and chores and maybe even a little me time that I can’t get during the day because my husband is always there and has high demands of my time. 
He works 530am to 4pm and wants dinner at 4 everyday. Then he usually falls asleep by like 6pm and wakes up around 12-3 am. I’m expected to make sure he has food and be up to let him hang out with the dogs and etc. 
We live in a house with my mom and sis, and he stays exclusively in his office or our room. He has a micro and fridge and etc. in his office and I keep him stocked up on food. (Soup. Sandwiches. Cereal. Oatmeal. Burritos. Yogurt. Water. Coffee. Drinks. Etc.)
Because he needs to sleep and the dogs are not prone to follow his schedule of sleep, I’m up u til he wakes up in the am and then usually have to make him food and etc. then I get to sleep. 
Last night I got to sleep at 7am. He was sleeping on my pillow and blanket and sprawled across our king size bed and I couldn’t even sit down. I tried to wake him enough for him to move but he didn’t. 

I explained all of this to him when I woke up at TEN AM. For my religious meeting. Afterward I made him some food and etc but I was SO tired. I have health issues and the stress is killing me. When I woke up 2pm he was pissed at me (it’s his day off and he was playing video games. )
 
So I cried and slept alone for about an hour then I went to Panera to study and get out the house (which he had told me I should do before he got mad at me)

1hcxvf1,Is my husband abusive?,ExcitingNews8170,35,169,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hcxvf1/is_my_husband_abusive/,"We are so in love. He is perfect (or as close to perfect as one can be) and my absolute dream man. I know he is my one true love, and I am his. He does everything for me and you can tell this man is head over heels for me BUT there is one issue that always make me doubt. I would say it's like 2% doubt and the 98% is just me knowing he is the man for me and he will change.

We've been together for 2 years now and whenever we fight and he gets triggered by me he punches wall so they breake, he has even broken his arm over punching a wall at home, thrown his suitcase at me outside, grabs  me very hard and I have ended up with sooo many bruises on my arms and legs because he pinches me really badly. He throws me around and is very aggresive, screaming that he will kill himself over me one day.

Everytime he comes near me face during his attacks I cover my face with my arms and this triggers him even more, he screams that I am overreacting and that he would never hurt me.. And this is his reaction when I trigger him. They way I trigger him is by either being quiet and giving the silent treatment or running my mouth and say bad and triggering stuff.
Whats shocked me the most was when he did this at his parents house, we were in the bedroom me and him, and I was 6 weeks pregnant (one week later I got an abortion) and he was screaming, grabbing me hard, shaking me and just being scary and aggressive. 

Afterwards he is super ashamed of his behaviour, and says that I deserve better and that he will be better for me. He says that he will go to therapy but haven't found a good therapist yet. He also ordered a book online (self-help book on aggressive behaviour) but he haven't even read it yet. He always say sorry afterwards and I know he means it. Everything just turns black for him and I am not an angel myself. I do trigger him badly sometimes with my mouth or just by giving the silent treatment. 

So he is the man I want, I am super obsessed and in love with him. There is no one else. And no I am not blinded by love and blablabla, but it's this small 2% doubt that I can't get over. He is abusive, and I am scared that if he don't change, and we have kids together I would die inside if he did this. I don't even have a question, I just wanted to let out my 2% doubt.

Also, everytime he becomes this way it's because I trigger him, he never does this out of the blue. It happens maybe 2 times/month, sometimes more depending on how much I trigger him.

Also, I'd like to add that he says that what trigger him also is that I don't give him a response with the silent treatment, and that emasculates him and he feels worthless and less like a man. So he does it for validation. We have talked about why he does it and I understand why.",2024-12-12 22:56:36,2025-03-17 03:19:32,abuse
1aujxi7,I left my abusive husband...only for him to get full custody of our kids...,boudiccathequeen,302,194,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1aujxi7/i_left_my_abusive_husbandonly_for_him_to_get_full/,"I need to get this off my chest as I am struggling big time emotionally and mentally. 

During our marriage he would often say to me ""you can never leave me because I'll never let you take my kids or my house"" (our kids, our house).

Well two years ago I left, he was arrested for three different domestic violence charges. He wasn't charged in the ends as there was not enough ""physical evidence"" (even though I had audio recordings etc).

Nevertheless I remained hopeful,  I started to rebuild my life with our two young kids, age 3 and 4 at the time. I work as a teacher and wanted to relocate 30 miles away to my workplace and for the kids to attend the school I teach at, so I'd be close by at all times. I filed for custody and permission to move their school. I had faith that the system, the family court,  would protect me and the kids.

I was wrong. I have endured two years of hell concluding in the worst outcome imaginable. Firstly my ex became intentionally unemployed,  so then he did not have to pay child support. Secondly he persuaded various neighbours and ""acquaintances"" to spy on my daily activities,  and report back to him. Thirdly he coerced the social worker/custody evaluator/CAFCASS  into believing that he was the true victim,  and that he had been the ""main carer of the kids"" since birth. He maintained contact with the custody evaluator via text message for the past two years, building a rapport with her. I was told not to contact her. When she visited me, she accused me of ""not trying harder to save the marriage "" She wrote her report entirely in his favour, and painting me as a cold hearted ""career woman"". 

Needless to say, I could not afford legal representation.  I was offered legal aid due to DV but because I'm a teacher, they said I earnt ""too much"" and asked me to pay a huge lump sum each month, indefinitely.  I was forced to decline.
Therefore,  I didn't ""play the game"" or have a ""strategy "" as my ex clearly did. Because he made himself unemployed,  he received legal aid! Just imagine... an abuser gets funded by the government!!!

As we approached our final hearing,  he breached the restraining order I had against him. He was found guilty and sentenced.  Not to prison,  unfortunately,  just community service.  The police were concerned about my safety due to ongoing stalking and harassment. He lost his gun license.  Various other things. 

Final hearing happened two weeks ago. He was cool as a cucumber. Played the game, said what the judge wanted to hear. I was very anxious and emotional.  The female judge took a shine to my abuser,, infact I don't think she bothered to read any of my evidence.  She said my ex husband was correct as describing me as ""inconsistent and erratic "". (Because I'd been crying). I realised she was now taking the side of my abuser. He was a master manipulator after all. 

Judge ruled that the kids will now live with him full time, and must not move schools. So I have had my babies taken away and put into my abusers hands. I see them once a fortnight.  I facetime them and he's there holding the phone  watching them. The kids look exhausted,  scruffy, dirty and confused. They are quiet. Like they've been told not to say certain things. I spoke to the school and told them my concerns but the school just say ""oh they seem OK at the moment. "" What nobody understands is that all the abuse my ex perpetrated was behind closed doors. I know for a fact its only a matter of time before he has another violent outburst. 

So that's that. I don't know how or when or even if I'll ever get my babies back. My abuser was right when he said if I ever left him, he'd never let me have the kids or the house. I might aswell have just stayed and endured the abuse.

If you got this far, thanks for reading.",2024-02-19 10:09:19,2025-03-17 03:19:34,abuse
1gaua8r,Anna Kendrick on abusive ex: “He was totally convinced of his own victimhood” (Call Her Daddy Podcast),Super-Situation2118,288,92,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1gaua8r/anna_kendrick_on_abusive_ex_he_was_totally/,"A podcast episode just came out on the Call Her Daddy podcast today with Anna Kendrick and she speaks about her past abusive relationship. She said something that I think is so important and wanted to share.

“I think that was the thing that I didn’t expect was how totally convinced he was of his own victimhood… I know him well enough, in spite of feeling like I didn’t know him at all, but I know him well enough to know, he’s not an actor, he’s not a performer. He [is] not a great liar in a lot of ways. So I was looking at someone who was actually suffering and I thought if he’s being manipulative, I’ll know it, because you know, I’ll smell the bullshit… But I don’t think he was putting on a performance. I think he genuinely believed I was torturing him. He told me one day I was terrorizing him because I was just crying because I couldn't pretend that things were fine anymore. And I just started crying and he screamed in my face, you’re terrorizing me. But it was truly from the place of a person who believed that they were being terrorized.” 

I thought it might resonate with others who have experienced something similar. It’s not always someone who’s putting on a performance or who is deliberately lying and gaslighting you, sometimes people really do believe what they are saying and have an incredibly distorted view of reality… and of course, it’s still abuse… but I think this realization can make it a little less confusing when you’re trying to identify whether it’s abuse or not, and/or when you’re trying to make sense of their behaviours. 

Edit: This came up in the interview when Anna was talking about how she really started to wonder if she was the problem, and it was really unexpected that he truly believed it and the things he was saying to her.",2024-10-24 04:21:22,2025-03-17 03:19:36,abuse
17coeaa,Is this abuse? I just got out of the most stressful relationship of my life and he says I was the abuser,swanintheevening,312,241,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17coeaa,"I just broke up with my partner of 2 years after 8-12 months of emotional torture. His main problem behaviors were: constant false accusations, threats, threats of suicide and self-harm, projection (accusing me of hating him, wanting someone else, wanting him to cut himself, etc), dumping me aggressively then begging me to come back over and over, trying to humiliate me to friends, smearing me to others, sending relatives after me to attack me, making provocative comments just to upset me, extreme hot-and-cold behavior, swearing at me, telling me to cut people out of my life, pretending to be dying to manipulate me, being manipulative in other ways, having rage episodes and extreme breakdowns when not getting what he wanted (he would pull knives on himself and stuff like that), irrational paranoia about other people's motives, lack of accountability/blaming other people for his own behavior, guilt-tripping me (especially when I said no to sex or tried to communicate), vindictiveness, and general entitlement. He had an extreme need for reassurance and validation, putting me into a maternal-like caretaker role. Whenever I fell short of his expectations in some way, he became extremely cold and callous. 

He believes that he was the main victim in the relationship and has been telling everyone that I was abusive, that I'm the crazy one, that I did all these things I didn't do, that I'm a completely evil person... During the breakup he called me the R-slur and had other people add me to group chats to cyberbully me. They were making false claims about me and I was crying trying to defend myself. I feel horrible about myself rn and am overthinking everything wondering if I really was 100% of the problem.",2023-10-20 23:16:29,2025-03-17 03:19:38,abuse

18k8zhs,Is my boyfriend abusive? Manipulative? What is this?,Particular_You_7829,203,286,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18k8zhs,"I don’t know what to think anymore. I posted a text string on AITAH asking if I was in the wrong for what I said to my boyfriend after he “borrowed” money from me without asking. I didn’t think the convo was so bad honestly, but all the comments were telling me he is gaslighting, manipulative, etc. Heres that original convo: https://imgur.com/a/hJVfNjK

My ex husband was mentally and physically abusive, so I guess even if my boyfriend is gaslighting or whatever, it’s been better than what I was dealing with before. But I think everyone’s answers on my last post opened my eyes, and I’ve been trying to pay extra attention to his potential manipulation. So today we had a conversation that I felt was way worse.

I was working, and he suddenly texts me accusing me of breaking the battery charger for his power tools. I didn’t know what he was talking about. I couldn’t remember the last time I even saw a charger of his much less touched one, so I thought he was saying that I came in contact with it very recently and did something to break it. Turns out he was accusing me of breaking it whenever I possibly unplugged it from an outlet in the kitchen, took it off the kitchen counter, and set it in the garage. He often leaves things on the kitchen counter that don’t belong on the kitchen counter, and he knows how much it bothers me because I hate the clutter & try to keep my house tidy. It was very tidy before he moved in. He has multiple times left that specific battery charger sitting plugged in on the kitchen counter for almost a week, so, yes, I have moved it from the counter into the garage. I have to set it on the garage floor right by the door because the garage is so full of his tools and car parts and boxes containing car parts (that he spends all his money on even though he can’t afford while he owes me thousands) that you can’t walk into the garage. I just got a shed so that he can store all of that in there. He says he now owes me less $100 since I broke his charger, even though I wouldn’t be surprised if he was the last one to touch it. I sometimes ask him to move this or that, and he’ll just stick it in the garage with all his other stuff. But apparently when I do that, I’m being disrespectful and breaking things. 

The cat piss comment is because I used to keep my cats litter boxes in my garage, and I had a cat door on the door from inside my house into the garage, but I’ve since closed it up and moved  their boxes inside. The only time a cat gets in the garage now is when my boyfriend leaves the roll up door up when he’s outside working on a car, and the stray cat we feed gets in there.

The “fine” he mentions I will get is because he’s had his car up on jacks and been working on replacing the clutch for a while. Our city has a rule that says you can’t have inoperable cars for longer than 2 weeks. We got a warning saying he has until Monday to fix it, but really all he has to do is take it off the stands and not make it look like it’s being worked on. So he’s saying he’s not going to have his clutch done because I broke his charger and the city is going to fine us on Monday. Except he won’t pay the fine, and it’ll be my responsibility because the house is actually in my name.

He says stuff like this to me very often. He blames me a lot. All the comments in my other post told me I need to leave him. I agree, and I think I need a solid plan before doing that. I’m scared, and he owes me thousands of dollars. I also would like to have a reason. I want to be able to tell our friends and his parents, who adore me and literally ask me when I’m going to have his baby, that their son is ___ and send screenshot proof before he can lie to them and blame it all on me. I don’t want to be blamed for things I didn’t do anymore.",2023-12-17 04:20:36,2025-03-17 03:19:44,abuse
1fmd8wy,My abuser sent me a video of him ending his life,killpippin,259,105,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1fmd8wy/my_abuser_sent_me_a_video_of_him_ending_his_life/,"Hi there, please look at my previous post as some sort of background

My (22ftm) ex (25m) sent me a video early this morning , essentially breaching our no contact conditions , with a video of his final words before he ended his life. He said he was sorry, still loved me, and expressed how he wanted all his assets to be given to me. He changed the profile photo on social media to a photo of his slit wrist.

I'm fucking terrified. And I feel so bad, and regret everything I did. The police got involved about four days ago and charged him with multiple accounts and ever since he has subtly breached no contact by expressing his love for me, how he misses me , and even sending money to my bank for food.

If he truly is dead..which, I haven't gotten any confirmation, I feel horrible. Like it is my fault. That if I did not get police involved and maybe left peacefully as friends he would still be alive. As much as I hate and despise what he did to me this was a person I was close with for two years and I just find myself blaming myself, especially worried about legal reproccusion. Won't I get arrested for murder? If essentially it was my fault?

I told him to contact a suicide hotline multiple times. He said he would, Last night, and this morning I woke up to a video and ""I'm sorry for lying to you one last time"". I'm so confused, devastated, and heartbroken. And I miss him horribly right now. I want nothing more than him to be by my side.",2024-09-21 21:20:58,2025-03-17 03:19:46,abuse
1i09237,Is it common for them to suddenly completely acknowledge that they've been abusive for the first time and do EVERYTHING you've asked them to do right when you're about to leave?,anonykitcat,53,122,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1i09237/is_it_common_for_them_to_suddenly_completely/,"My partner has been textbook verbally and emotionally abusive for most of our relationship, starting 3-4 months in (the first incident, I halfway blamed myself, which is why I stayed), which has been \~5 years.

He has blamed it largely on his mental health (ADHD, PTSD, severe depression), and his impulse control/rage issues. I've had endless conversations asking him to please stop, begging him to please stop, encouraging him to do anger management, meditation, join some kind of group therapy, see a psychologist, do couples therapy, etc., for about \~4.5 years (ever since it first started).

We were both in a VERY bad mental place when we met. We soothed each others' wounds and traumas, and in many ways, helped and supported each other. There was a lot of DEEP love and support, on a soul-level, but also a lot of pain, from his verbal/emotional abuse episodes (which happen approx once every few weeks to every couple of months). When he's good and sweet, he's really incredible, and I just want that to last. In the ""good"" times, I tend to forget how bad it can be, and accept his apologies. But after each fight, I tell him it's not ok, that I need him to stop, that I can't keep handling this. He sees me cry, break down, shut down, have headaches/pains for days, get stressed out, miss work/school deadlines, and yet it keeps happening. 

I told him 1.5 years ago after our engagement that he needed to stop this if we were to get married. We postponed marriage 6 months ago because he had more episodes, and I told him again that he had behaviors that he needed to change.  I have tried several times to explain to him that he's being abusive, and until very recently he's always denied that it's real abuse, saying it's not like he is beating me up or giving me a black eye, so therefore it's not that bad and I'm exaggerating. He's apologized for being a ""jerk"" or being an ""asshole"" and acknowledges that he has shitty behaviors, but has not acknowledged that it's abuse.

A few weeks ago, after his last episode sent me to a nervous breakdown, I told him I didn't know if I could continue our relationship. After that, he realized he might lose me and suddenly shifted gears. He enrolled in psychotherapy (he plans to go 1-2x/week), started meditating 2x daily, seems highly motivated to change, and was suddenly acknowledging that everything he'd done to me during his episodes throughout our had been abusive. We went through a list of all his episodes, and he acknowledged full-heartedly that it was indeed abuse, that he'd treated me terribly, that I deserved much better, and that he had followed the same cycle of abuse he learned from his parents (as I've been telling him to years, but he's been resistant to hearing). He did all of the things I'd asked him to do 4.5 years ago, and consistently throughout our relationship until now.

He is finally saying he wants to fully change his episodes/behaviors for HIM, for HIS life, and also for me. But why has he waited so long? Why has he waited until I'm about to leave to do everything I wanted him to do, everything I asked?

He’s always been a little neurotic about things like plans and giving him a heads up before I do anything. He generally doesn’t like it when I do things he hasn’t approved first, like when I order something at a restaurant or when I make plans with people he doesn’t know that well.

But that’s just how he is. I guess he’s a micromanager and can be a little uptight about things but I never took any of that as abusive.

The first time I mentioned that he's being emotionally abusive was about 1 year into our relationship. After he was screaming at me and calling me names for hours over a stupid reason (me putting a dish in the wrong place), I told him that he was emotionally abusing me. He denied it and flipped it back on me, calling me the emotional abuser. Everytime since then, whenever I mention that he is abusive to me, he has mocked me, laughed at it, said it's not ""real abuse"" because I'm not covered in bruises, and that I'm lucky to be with him because some men are *actually* abusive and hit their wives. His abusive episodes happen roughly once a month, and I have told him a handful of times that he's being abusive to me but he always acts like that's ridiculous.

Now that I am seriously on the verge of leaving him (we are on a break), I laid out ALL the emotionally/verbally abusive episodes to him, very clearly, and explained exactly why these are textbook examples of abuse. I sent him domestic abuse resources outlining the types/techniques of abuse he had used (yelling, calling me names, throwing things, pounding his fists, kicking things, punching the wall/table close to us, breaking stuff in front of me, threatening silent treatment, stonewalling, dumping me, waking me up in the middle of the night to yell at me, abandoning me in unfamiliar places, humiliating me/yelling at me in public, etc). I explained to him how law enforcement, domestic abuse experts, and mental health professionals all agreed that this abuse, and that he had done ALL of these things.

Finally, he agreed to everything. He had a sudden ""epiphany""/wakeup call where he suddenly realized that yes he had been abusing me, hurting me, and mistreating me for years, that he felt absolutely terrible, and that I deserved much better. He is fully ready to accept and acknowledge the abuse for the first time ever and says he wants to change by meditating and getting extensive psychotherapy (which he's resisted for years). He wants to completely eradicate the abusive behaviors and be a different person, and he wants me to give him another chance.

Is this common? Should I believe him? Why is it that they deny they've been abusive until you're about to leave? How does your abuser react when you tell him he's abusive?",2025-01-14 20:06:12,2025-03-17 03:20:06,abuse

My boyfriend called me a r** and I slapped his face hard twice.,Budget-Friendship-22,190,96,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1f9tgld/i_am_becoming_a_monster_and_a_physical_abuser_my/,"I’ve known my boyfriend for 8 months, and from the beginning, he was calling me 'retard' and the N-word. He would do his best to put me down and talk about how his ex was smart and I’m not. Last night, he said there are only four people he thinks highly of, and he started naming four girls, including his ex. I asked him, 'Don’t you think highly of me too?' and he said no, but maybe one day he would when I 'become less of a retard.' I got really mad and started slapping his face, telling him i told you to never call me that again and never speak to me that way. And then I tried to leave, but he started hugging me so tightly that I couldn’t get away, saying, 'Don’t go, I want you, please stay.'

Honestly, he deserved it, and I don’t regret slapping him hard, but I’m scared of who I’m becoming. It’s terrifying to think I’m turning into someone who reacts physically. I was in a 5-year relationship before, and I never got mad or even yelled at my ex. But this guy keeps telling me I’m an idiot every second, comparing me to his ex, talking badly about me all the time, cheating on me, and doing things that are completely unacceptable. Every time I try to leave, he locks the door and holds me, refusing to let me go. I hate my life with him so much.",2024-09-05 18:21:01,2025-03-17 03:20:16,abuse
1b0w0f8,"This is abuse, right?",sadb0nes,187,163,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1b0w0f8,"Some clarifying points: 

1. Boyfriend and I do not live together 
2. I have a toddler son from my previous marriage. We are divorced and live in different states. 


For context: boyfriend and I have been fighting all weekend. My son was supposed to go with his dad out of state this past weekend. Unfortunately, that fell through and I no longer had childcare for a concert we were set to go to with his friends. I ended up selling my ticket as I did not have late night/overnight childcare. My sister invited me to her birthday brunch/festivities on Sunday and I was able to attend at the last minute as my brother-in-law volunteered to watch my son since he was already with my nephews.

Boyfriend talks to me like this often and says I essentially deserve it. While I understand being upset, is this abusive on his end? Am I being overly sensitive?",2024-02-26 23:12:25,2025-03-17 03:21:18,abuse
1flx9at,HELP - husband is emotionally abusive and I don’t know what to do  ,Visual_Most4357,130,106,https://v.redd.it/lv59pvxz24qd1,"Hello everyone, first time posting here. Please excuse any grammar errors, English is not my first language. 

My husband and I have been married for 2 years, and we have a 5 month old son. Although we had some issues while dating, things were overall good during the beginning of our relationship. But it started taking a dark turn towards the end of my pregnancy. 

Fast forward to now, this has become our routine. My husband systematically insults me and belittles me anytime we have a minor disagreement or I complain about anything at all. It feels like I’m constantly walking on eggshells and I can’t voice any opinion, otherwise he’ll blow over. This also extends to our son, who gets insulted and yelled at for doing basic baby things like crying when he’s hungry or needing someone to rock him to sleep (even though I’m the one always tending to his needs, I never force husband to do it).

The recording I attach is today’s example of a fight that started with me getting mad at him and “nagging” him for name calling our baby because he was crying. He was crying because he was hungry. During the whole recording, he was holding our son, who has to witness this toxic dynamic. Husband kept our son in his arms with me unable to take him since he was threatening to leave with him (not the first time, he has been using this threat since baby was 8 days old). There was also a friend of Husband’s who was also a witness to this but seems to think his friend’s actions are justifiable.

Needless to say, I don’t love my husband anymore and I’d be happy to never see him again. But I worry about our son. If I leave him, I worry that I’m escaping this man’s emotional abuse but leaving my son to suffer all of it instead. I won’t be there to try to shield him anymore, or to take it for him. On the other hand, this situation is severely affecting my mental state and my ability to focus and properly care for my son. I also wonder if there is a small chance that husband might not be as abusive if I’m not around to “trigger him”. 

Another concern if we end up divorcing and writing a custody agreement is the fact that I will have to return to Europe as I can’t make ends meet here. That would mean sending my baby boy over to the USA with this man for extended periods of time.  

If anyone has any piece of advice, it would be incredibly appreciated. I’m at a loss. Thank you to those who read this.",2024-09-21 07:04:35,2025-03-17 03:21:19,abuse

He will take my pot (that I'm currently cooking something in) off the burner cuz it's in his way even though it's on the back burner and he wants to use the front burner 

He will put my glass of orange juice that I just poured over with the dirty dishes if I go to the bathroom and come back because it was annoying him by sitting on the otherwise clean counter

He does a lot of little criticisms throughout the day like saying you are too slow etc and when I asked him to stop nagging me like that every day he said no he will continue 

We've been together 9.5 years and there were little times occasionally when he was mean here and there but it has really ramped up and been escalating ever since we had a baby who is now 1 year old. I am considering leaving even though she already calls him dad and they adore each other. He is good to her (so far).

Edit to update: he was nice for a month and then he started being mean again. I'm not longer interested in him and thinking of a plan to leave.

Edit; it has escalated even worse with frequent yelling, swearing calling me stupid. I've gone grey rock until I can leave",2025-02-03 12:20:15,2025-03-17 03:21:26,abuse

He has multiple mental health conditions, and possible a neurological disorder as well. So I've been excusing/forgiving all the terrible ways he's treated me, thinking that he is not mentally/neurologiclaly well, but I still love him regardless (when he's nice, he's very sweet, but he has extreme rage and anger issues that can be cruel and terrifying).

So -- if they have a serious mental health condition, is it still abuse?  
What about a physical/neurological condition?

If they act violently if they have a personality disorder, autism, chronic pain/illness, schizophrenia, dementia, Huntington's disease, etc...is it still considered ""abuse"", or is it just violent/unsafe behavior?

At what point should you stay with the person no matter what (even if they sometimes scare or endanger you) out of love and loyalty, vs prioritizing yourself/your own safety by leaving them?

My partner was in the other room taking a quiz for school while I, who had never cooked before, was put up to the task of cooking dinner. I asked my partner's friend for help while making dinner. Things like “Is the meat cooked all the way?"" Or “does this look undercooked?"" I had no idea what I was doing.

I told him no, he knew I said no, he said he was almost done and ""just open up it's fine""... I cried my eyes out and he apologized and promised to be better. But he continues to wake me up with sex while I am unconscious and exhausted, and definitely don't want to. I told his mom about it, looking for support, and she said ""He's 20. Guys are just like that."" 

A couple of weeks later, he and I were arguing and I called him abusive, and he said ""I don't know where you're getting all these ideas from but you just come up with this shit and all these prophecies, I haven't done shit."" I almost went berserk. This man.... he calls me an idiot, an entitled bitch, he tells me to shut up, to fuck off, to go rot, etc ALLL the time. And I am the only one doing chores and spending money on necessities. 
I keep asking for a break, or to be just co-parents and nothing else and he keeps saying no and that he'd find me if I left him. He said if I ever speak to any other guys that he'd break my phone and slash their tires...
I have literally begged for us to just break up and he refuses. I know it sounds like I could leave anyways but my only other housing option is across the country with my parents and I'd have to schedule a flight, get a ride to the airport, and pack suitcases etc; all WITH my two year old. And all without him intervening. Before our child was even born, my partner told me he wouldn't let me fly home, that he'd break my ID in half and make it unusable if I tried. 
I can't stand him most days... even when I start to like him, he'll suddenly slam a door or tell me to mind my own fucking business, and bam I hate him again. 
So I went out with someone else. And I really had a good time and liked them.. so we went out again.... and plan to again.

My ex lives fives hours away from me on a property with acreage so he takes my dog, G,  in the spring and summer so she can enjoy the outdoors and I have her fall and winter.

He called me Tuesday night and told me she was very sick vomiting and hadn't kept down food for water in three days.
I flip out begging him to take her to the vet. He says he can't afford it. I say I will pay!! Just please take her!! He tells me he doesn't trust me to pay and he can't risk me not paying. I finally get him to agree to take her as soon as the vet opens in the morning.

I get the first two screenshots of text messages at 12:30am Wed saying she passed.

Friday he called and said I'm going to be mad at him but that G is alive and healthy.
Turns out he can't take her where he's moving to so he had to fess up.

The last two screenshots from Facebook messenger where he ""apologizes” but says he did it because I broke his heart. We haven’t been together in over a year. 

We've arranged to meet for me to get her today (Sat).

Obviously I'm extremely relieved my baby girl is ok!!! This man has put me through so much hell but this tops it all.

Over the years he's caused loss of hearing in my left ear from my head being stomped on in his work boots, broken cheek, broken nose, bruised ribs, multiple concussions, countless black eyes, two broken teeth, bone spurs in my neck from trauma… that’s just off the top of my head. Not counting material objects he's ruined of mine and cheated constantly.

He rarely cries but he bawled when we talked on the phone Wednesday 
morning over her “loss”.

I really believed him. I've been in absolute misery. I had been sober for years but I got wasted Wed and Thursday to numb the pain and guilt I felt.

1ivsvom,Did your abuser lie about their height?! A funny take on tiny bits of the years of gaslighting.,PersonalDefinition66,80,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ivsvom/did_your_abuser_lie_about_their_height_a_funny/,"So, my abuser said he was nearly 6ft. He'd say it a lot. And I had no reference... Bare in mind that I don't go around measuring people nor do most people announce their height... 😂😅🫠 So I didn't realise, the truth. 
Okay, there were signs... His friend who was noticeably taller once said they were 6ft. After they left my abuser said ""I don't know why he says he's 6ft, I'm nearly 6ft."" Okay... And when he allowed me to buy a six foot Christmas tree... I noticed it was much taller than him. Huh. I guess though, his height wasn't really my main concern... I was in survival mode, so I didn't see so much that was right there...

I have a partner who is 6ft. And he's a mountain compared. I'm assuming my abuser was 5ft 8 at most... 😂 I don't know why that's so funny to me right now. 🤣 

He also lied about being born deaf and having miracle surgery that gave him hearing. 😳 🤣 

And the... ""I could have been a millionaire if only... *a load of made up bollocks had gone in their favour.*"" and the super believable ""I was such a wonderful child, I did everything right, it was everyone around me that was evil.""

Luckily he’s an ex now, so I’m safe now. We broke up a little over four years ago. For me, the break up was surprisingly easy. There was some struggle and sadness of course, but more than anything, it was a relief. After the break up, I didn’t think about him for years, until recently. 

The abuse was emotional. He called me names, pointed out everything that he thought was wrong with my body, compared me to others, threatened me with violence and he took nude photos of me when I was sleeping and coerced me with those photos. Also cheated on me with multiple women. There were other things as well, but I don’t want to go into detail. At the time I knew what he did was wrong but I didn’t realize that it was in fact abuse.

I mentioned that I hadn’t thought about him since the break up and that is true but I have thought a lot about the things he said about me. He managed to make me believe that I’m disgusting, crazy and that there is just something really wrong with me and that no one would want to date me. I realize that it’s probably what he wanted and that it might not be true. But still, I can’t go on a date because I’m so scared that my date would actually see me the same way he did. 

So my confidence is not good but other than that, I’ve been okay. Until recently when I heard how he’s doing. He has a new girlfriend, they even have a child together. He has a good job and he’s providing for his family. He has bought a house for them and is renovating it. I heard that they are really happy and that he has changed a lot. With me he was jobless and I had to pay everything and do all the household work. 

Hearing about him made me so angry and bitter. He gets to continue his life without any consequences. He would have never done any of that for me. I thought he just wasn’t a good guy. Turns out he actually can be. So he chose to abuse me. How is his new girlfriend so much better? Why does she deserve all the love? and why did he chose to abuse me? It feels like he must have hated me, or why would there be such a difference between how he treated me and her. It also makes me believe everything he said about me even more. 

I really don’t want to be such a negative person. It just feels like I have sunken into darkness. I’m sad and hopeless all the time and what’s even worse, I wish something bad happened to him. How can I become the person who is happy for the success of their ex?",2024-09-27 11:30:29,2025-03-17 03:22:09,abuse

And what sucks is that you might never get any type of closure regarding the abuse, or at least not the closure that you may want or need. 

It sucks that sometimes other people also think that your abuser didn’t do anything wrong, or mitigate their actions to make it seem like it was just a misunderstanding, just arguments, just differences between two people. It sucks that not everyone will be on your side, even when the evidence slaps them cold in the face.

It sucks that abusers get to live their life happily without repercussions of their actions, no consequences, and they don’t feel the pain they made you feel, and if they do it’s always to victimize themselves somehow. It all just sucks, it’s so fucking stupid. I hate that I have to learn that the hard way. 

I hate that he may get to just forget, get to be happy, get to have people that love and support him, have a support system while I have next to nobody in my corner, nobody to soothe me, nobody to tell me that it’s going to be okay. I just want to be held and told that everything will be okay, I want to be supported, I want to have clear, unadultered love and support. It sucks that I don’t.

I have closed in on a little apartment for myself. I got a puppy.

After being in a home where I was truly loved: my parents I realized how sad, cold and alone I had been. Over time I went blind for a lot of things.

Blind to a comfortable home temperature. Comfortable with thinking about every penny spend. Feeling guilty for buying that dress I wanted for so long that was finally on sale. Feeling entitled for wanting date nights… being treated sometimes. 

I started to think about what makes me happy. I love to travel, dress up to go to a nice restaurant. Throw dinner parties, entertain people, think about Christmas gifts 6 months in advance. Have a cosy house…. And I realized just how much he had taken from me with that one little sentence: is that really necessary…

Is anything ever? If you have a roof, food, bed and a TV you are there right? Is travel necessary? Is having nice clothes necessary? Is a shower necessary? A haircut? A party? A hobby? A wedding? No! 

I know now that abusers are not per definition bad people. He is broken and he has trauma I have no time or energy for. He got free from abuse and decided to become the abuser. I know he is in therapy and we initially agreed on 6 months no to low contact. But I felt I was certain it was not for me anymore and I didn’t want to keep him dangling.

Breaking up with him was very hard. It made me very sad. I never wanted to hurt him and I loved this man very deeply. I wanted us to be each others happy ever after. We both came from dark places and I wanted us to thrive together. His family told me I was the one, I was everything he was looking for and I felt so lucky. 

But we only have 1 life and he has so much work to do before he even becomes the bear minimum of what I needed. 

I feel failed. Like my story has a bad ending. I feel very broken and sad. I will take my time to just be me. I hope he does the same. I truly hope he finds the one and becomes happy. Mostly I hope that for myself but for now I am enough by my self with the pupper! 

Thank you all for your time and support. I am going to have a little cry in some furbaby’s fluffy fur",2023-09-21 19:21:32,2025-03-17 03:22:12,abuse

As for the Xbox thing, my husband made me have a sugar daddy and I did not want to do that. Come to find out that he's actually married so when his wife found out, I had to return the Xbox he ordered with his card or she was going to call the police and say we stole it. All of the pictures that have damage to our house is because I told him I had to return the Xbox. I then proceeded to spend my entire paycheck buying a new Xbox 2 days later. He always over reacts like this in every single situation. He puts his hands on me in every single argument. Just Friday he started am argument because his mom gave me $35 for a babysitter for our 2 yr old daughter. He beat me really badly that night, his friends who were coming over after they got off work said they could hear him yelling at me and calling me names and loud banging all the way down the street. They had to beat on the door. I'd also like to note that he will hold me hostage in a room and barricade it whenever he argues with me. When I finally got around him and was able to let them in they had to get him off of me and away from me. I was in so much pain from him beating me. This time he beat me and did the entire argument with my daughter right in the room. She was crying so badly it broke my fucking heart. She was crying for her mommy and saying ""Dada no no no stop no dada"" while crying over and over again while also crying for me. He pushed me one time so hard I fell back and that caused my daughter to also fall and hit her head. When I went to comfort her and hug her he pulled me away by my hair and slapped me and told me that it was my fault. He broke our closet door in our room that had a glass mirror on it which also broke right by my daughter. He then pulled the metal rod off the wall in the closet and beat me with that. I grabbed it from him and hit him in the face with it. For me that was my final straw and she is currently not living here but with my dad instead until I can find a way to get a place for her and I. I cannot have a job anymore because he won't watch our daughter. He will neglect her the entire time I'm at work. I will come home and she will have a really saggy gross diaper on, the same one I left her in, and stained clothes and food in her hair. She will have gotten into things she wasn't supposed to. I fought back for the first time Friday and he's now trying to play the victim because of one bruise while my body is covered in them. His other friend has had to pull him off of me before as well. He kept playing the victim to all of his friends but now that they've seen what he does to me and how he acts they don't really like him anymore. He blamed me for that and I got another beating the next day because his best friend and his gf saw what he was doing to me. I miss my baby so much and I go see her whenever I can. I'm so lost really. My dad won't take me in and I have no one else. He has isolated me from all my friends and family. I'm so confused because do I deserve this? Have I done something to deserve this? It's so hard to tell anymore. The things he says makes me feel like I do. This is genuinely only the tip of the iceberg. He has attempted to kill me 3 times. He choked me one day so bad yelling he was going to kill me that I was losing my vision. I had to kick him in the balls 3 times to get him off of me. The next time he threatened to shoot me with the gun we had (After this I sold it as it was in my name.) And held me at gunpoint. The last time was Friday when he took a piece of the broken glass and held it to my neck because I kept begging him to let me get to my baby and he told me to shut up and if I said it again he'd kill me. But I can't help but feel like I deserve it yk. I feel like I'm just a fuck up waste of space that should've never been born to begin with. Please someone help me because I genuinely cannot tell.

The autoban IS NOT in place for just *any* male-oriented subs; it's in place for subs specifically devoted to centering, condoning, and encouraging misogyny (r/DegradeThisCunt, r/MaleSuperiority, etc etc. Stuff like that).

**This is a genuine, warranted, necessary safety precaution tool** to cut down on a MASSIVE amount of misogyny floating through this sub.

**The autoban bot cannot determine context. For example, it cannot distinguish between someone using one of these misogynistic subs to endorse misogyny; someone using one of those subs to fight back against and challenge misogyny; and/or someone using one of these subs who genuinely did not realize its overall misogyny.**

**Therefore, we manually review all ban appeals related to this bot to see where they do and don't apply.**

If you receive an autoban as a result of this program and you are NOT using any of these sexist subs to degrade women or endorse misogyny, the ban will be lifted. If you are banned because you use any of these subs to endorse misogyny or you refuse to acknowledge their entire context of misogyny, this sub is not a space for you.

**As one example of the massive amount of misogyny in this sub, a post was made several months ago by a woman who cheated on her abusive husband who then beat her. Dozens upon dozens of comments from men said she deserved it and they hoped he beat her to a pulp or worse. Rape and death threats against women and women mods in this sub are a regular occurrence, as are gendered slurs, harassment, and sexual objectification of women. If you haven't seen the problem in this sub, EITHER YOU AREN'T PAYING ATTENTION OR WE GOT TO IT FIRST.**

With the election of Trump and Vance to the White House in the US, the world is about to see a massive increase in the normalization of and encouragement of *global misogyny,* including endorsement of violence against women. 

**This sub is for ALL GENDERS, but misogyny is a constant issue here, there has been a SIZEABLE uptick in misogynistic rhetoric since the presidential election outcome, and we are taking necessary precautions to keep it safe. Bear in mind the same people who infiltrate our sub with misogynistic rhetoric are also the same people who call male survivors ""p-ssies"" and tell them women can't be abusive and that they're weak (FALSE).**

Briefly, I was severly depressed from the age of 8, couldn't communicate my pain, so when I was 13 I ,,gave myself an eating disorder""(stopped eating to get emotional attention, not just academic preassure). My mother took me to several therapists, but by that time I actually internalised all the eating disorder thoughts and nothing worked, so she reached to some weird ,,nonconventional"" therapist/ex religious guru( I don't know how else to call it, he was one of the first people in Poland(where I live) to organise and lead group buddist meditations)/her ex lover( I know, quite an insane combo). I'll state right here my mother is also buddist, found this beliefs through him and basically sees him as a sort of savior. So despite him not being in fact an actual therapist, she thought he could in some way help me too. We met through Skype( me and therapist guy, he lived then in London) and immidietely clicked. It wasn't therapy. At first meeting he asked me if I starved myself because I wanted to be fuckable to men, and wouldn't accept my protest to that statement. Also immidietely declared that he wanted to be my friend and asked for my number. Me being 13 and not knowing how therapy works, thought it was normal. My mother knew about everything and even encouraged it. Soon after we would be basically inseparable, I would text him all the time, videocall a few times a week. Soon we started visiting him and his wife in London pretty regulary. Now, weird thing, despite our super intense contact I don't remeber much from that time despite him constanly wanting to talk with me about sex(asking if I think about it, what do I like, what porn I like etc), making comments on my body( how beautiful and enticing it was), getting mad at me for ,,not being able to start interesting conversations, and being very touchy feely with me(although NEVER crossing any serious boundries. Thats way I'm still constantly questioning the whole situation. It was more like constant hugs, embraces, brushing my hair, giggling me, tying my shoes, always playing with our feet under the table). When we were visiting them he would drink and also give me to drink copious amount of alcohol( I was, again, 13-14), trying to be my mentor also in drawing which I was persuing at that age, often being VERY rigorous, basically bringing me to tears. Food problems got better because I basically was in love with him and got a reason to live now. Also he would just tell me what to eat and how much. Everyone( my mother and his wife. I didnt have friends and quite a poor contact with rest of my family) knew about everything, thought it was perfectly normal and he was my savior. He also encouraged me (to be honest sometimes even forced) to completely cut off contact with my dad( he was also living in a different country anyway, but we had phone contact before), later with whole his side of family and start practising buddism for 2-4 hours a day. He also really preassured me to finish high school early so I could study in london(where he lived), getting REALLY mad at me for my struggles with school at that time. They were mostly due to depression, which was also the reason for him to call me lazy and unmature, and threaten to ,,not be interested in being my friend""  if I ,,keep living like that"". By the time I was 15 he had planned that we will go on  holidays to Italy toghether, even booked us a hotel room with one bed in advance, basically told me he wanted to sleep with me there. Again everyone knew, did nothing. Unfortunately, or fortunately at that time, I was also starting experimenting with drugs at that age, and ended up getting quite seriously hit by a car while high. Excatly around time of our planned holidays. So again, nothing really happened, but weird thinking back. On the other hand he, almost the next day, flew to visit me in the hospital and kissed me passionetly on the mouth for the first time. He was staying with me often then when I was back home but still immobile, showing me porn, encouraging me to masturbate and tell him about it, carrying me around( I had to lay in bed for months, i broke pelvic bones). When I was freshly 16 I basically was allowed to fly to him myself. That's the time our full-blown ,,romantic"" relationship started. He declared his love and desire for me, stated I'm the best thing that happened to him and he ,,wants to be with me"". We were then kissing all the time, holding hands, he was sometimes groping me, often going around me naked, encouraged me to be naked especially on skype calls also, feed me by hand, spit liquids into my mouth( dont even ask, I suppose that was his kink, I thought it was normal back then). We would drive around whole England( also to avoid raising suspicion in his wife ), sightseeing beutiful nature and art, eating fancy meals and drinking expensive wines, he would buy me gifts and give me money, to my 16 yo terribly lonely self it was paradise. And yet he didn't sleep with me, always said he's going to do that if I turn 18 and stay loyal to him. So I don't know what to feel about this, to be honest nothing really happened. But things started to get more painful.
 Besides the constant diminishing and demanding to ,,get to his level"" or he will loose interest in me, giving me alcohol constantly, making comments about my food and excersise routine so I'll have a perfect body, he started to get very possesive. He would never admit that though, said he wanted me to get some experience before our ,,big night"" even. Yet was extremely disapproving of every new person I met, always coercing me to break contact with them. I had only him, my every day, my every thought was consumed by him. And that's when he one day decided to tell me I was a stupid kid to even think we would ,,be toghether"". Told me to write in my notebook several times that I won't be acting and dressing so slutty around married men again, forced fo apologise to his wife, and treat this whole relationship as ,,fun experience"" and be his ,,mate"" now. The only problem was that my whole fucking word shattered, I fell into complete hysteria, experienced serious depersonalization and derealization and geniuly thought I would just die from sheer despair and broker heart. Never experienced anything like that again in my life and I had tons of mental health struggles. Yet I knew that I had no one to save me, so I stayed with him anyway. He would still engage in some romantic/sexual gestures, but shamed me when I shown the initiative. And from time to time, laughed and mocked me for treating it seriously all again. My mother and his wife saw me as some wicked temptress. During our ,,relationship"" I had gone from elementry schooll to high school, changed high schools, didn't make any friends anywhere because of his constant demands to call or text me on breaks, and generally feeling so out of touch with my peers since I was basically living like a adult with him. I was completely lonely and depressed, missing him all the time, now also rejected. During one of our super drunk conversations he asked to escape with him. He was deadly serious. I was to stunned and drunk to even think, so I said on autopilot said no, which led to more diminishing and witholding affection since I was a stupid teenager and,, not treating this seriously"". When I was 17, there was a situation where I was on a dance camp and we had no private space so I couldn't anwser his phones. Everyone would freak out if they heard a 17 yo talking to clearly very adult men calling her darling. When I came back he threw a complete fit, again screaming at me, calling be disloyal, unserious, manipulative and disrespectful. I was so numb inside at this time, I just hung up. Didn't speak to him for next few years, even after that, very briefly. I'm 20 now and this is way behind me, yet, like I said in the beginning, I'm thinking about him almost everyday, I don't feel traumatized, to be honest I don't feel much at all, but it all just seems so strange and I had to get it of my chest.",2025-01-22 21:17:36,2025-03-17 03:22:35,abuse
1iwjdk7,Are people prone to be abusive if they're in a relationship with the wrong person?,da-lawl,29,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iwjdk7/are_people_prone_to_be_abusive_if_theyre_in_a/,"I'm asking because I talked to my ex's mom today and she told me that he never behaved this way with any of his exes except for me.

I broke things off with my ex last night because he shoved me twice and spat on my face (I did not once touch the man)

All of this happened because he got mad at me for not finishing him off during sex because he was struggling keeping it up, so I wanted to take a break and go check on a cat that I recently adopted.

He got SO mad at me and called me selfish, and went to the bathroom and started jerking himself off to porn.

I asked him to leave after that and he kept on degrading me and it turned to him shoving me twice and spitting on me.

This was my 7th attempt of leaving him and I'm hoping to god he stays away for good.

His mother told me he's never behaved like this with anyone else. Which basically sounds like she was taking his side and saying that his reaction was valid considering the stress that I have put him through which is bullshit.

I'm asking if it's possible for someone to turn abusive if two people who are not compatible with each other force the relationship to work due to let's say a trauma bond.

Would the shoving and spitting happened with some other woman if she was more right for him?

I'm asking because I'm starting to blame myself for his abuse...even though deep down I know it wasn't my fault

During that time he broke a chair, tear off my pillow, punched the bed next to me and few times lightly punched me on my thighs. He is saying that this is reactive abuse due to my emotional abuse towards him. The abuse that he is talking about is that i suck at communicating, i am neglecting him in his opinion, i am running and hiding from our problems and i can’t make myself stop avoiding serious problems because i am afraid that i can not resolve them.

Last time we were in a really big fight was last summer. He tried to take my phone and i refused because he has done it several times and there is nothing on it. He tear the pocket of my pants and i started screaming and pushed him away maybe too harshly. We didn’t see each other for day. He called me and apologised and i got back home. He hasn’t layed a finger on me since then.

1h6ctqv,"Why does everyone says ""abuse always escalates""? How often does mental/verbal/emotional abuse become physical? And does this count as 'escalation'?",anonykitcat,29,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1h6ctqv/why_does_everyone_says_abuse_always_escalates_how/,"Nearly everyone says ""abuse always escalates"", and I have considered this statement to try and determine if it's true (both in general, and for my situation).

For context: I have been with my partner for \~4 years, and he has *never* laid a finger on me. He considers men who batter/beat up women to be lowly and disgusting and prides himself in the fact that he has never done it. He says stuff like ""what kind of men would lay a finger on a woman?"" and ""it's so pathetic to beat up your wife."" He also reminds me that (despite admitting, sometimes, that he behaves in a verbally abusive way to me) that he is really not that bad, and it could be much worse, and *at least* he's never *""really""* abused me or hit me. He's promised me that he never will do that.

But here are some things (and some timelines) that he has done:

* At first, he was the sweetest person ever...didn't yell at me, told me how fantastic I was, how I was the ""one for him"", that we were meant to be together, etc. Bought me flowers, was very attentive, and seemed like an ideal boyfriend and life partner.
* Roughly 2-3 months into our relationship was the first time he ever raised his voice at me. I was taken aback and considered leaving, but he profusely apologized, said he was in a really bad mood that day, and that it was wrong of him to take it out on me. Then he was extremely nice to me for awhile after.
* About a month after that, he raised his voice again. It was the same thing: he said it was wrong and he shouldn't have done it, and profusely apologized. Then he was extra nice to me for about a week.
* This repeats a lot until \~6 months in, when he really ""raged"" at me for the first time. By that, I mean he wasn't just raising his voice, he was yelling/screaming and seemed extremely mad. I don't remember what caused it, but it was something minor. It involved him name-calling me (including all the curse words I can think of) and a lot of hurtful things were said, and we almost broke up at that point, but again, there were profuse apologies, and he admitted that he had a problem with anger and impulse control, and needed to work on it.
* A little after that, he had another episode, and I tried to ""take a break"". As I was leaving, he put a knife to his throat and threatened to k\*ll himself in front of me if I left. It was extremely traumatic for me, and I didn't leave...I stayed and calmed him down. I thought about calling the police, but they are not responsive where I live and they wouldn't have come in time.
* Sometime after that, we got into a fight because I forgot to bring something we needed when we went on an errand. This led to him trying to dump me/abandon me in a foreign city where I did not have my passport, keys, or wallet (I left those where we were staying). I had to follow him (with him running away and trying to lose me in the crowd) just to be able to get back to my things. 
* Over the next year or two, his rage outbursts would be similar: yelling/screaming, name-calling, following me around yelling at me (even if I didn't want to fight), etc. About a year or two in, he started throwing things. He became really angry over something and smashed his phone. Then shortly after that, he kicked the trashcan, smashed the lid, smashed the broom, and maybe some other things (I don't remember)
* After that, he was on pretty good behavior for awhile (we were also long-distance). However, he did blow up at me, call me names, and threaten to break up with me when I told him I was scared to visit him in his home country due to an active war (I cancelled the trip, but the plane was cancelled anyways because there were literal MISSILES in the air around the same time/place that I was supposed to arrive). He told me I was being selfish, a coward, that I didn't love him, and that I was overreacting.
* Recently, he got angry with me over nothing (I left a couple dishes in the sink because I hadn't slept and was tired), and threw a knife in the sink. When I told him that was unacceptable, he got even more enraged, and started throwing random stuff in the house as hard as he could and they were bouncing off the walls (nothing of mine, mostly just his stuff). I told him I was scared and asked him to leave, and he said that I hadn't even seen him angry/scary yet, but threatened to get *really* angry and to ""tear the whole house apart"". He stayed in the room despite me asking him to leave and kept yelling at me until I calmed down.

So, he's never hit me or touched me. He's thrown things, but not my stuff. He engages in verbal/emotional abuse once every few weeks or months, and in between, he apologizes, admits he has problems, says he tries to do things to ""work on it"", claims he is trying *really* hard to keep his rage and impulses under control. I am wondering if what I described counts as escalation, even though it's been several years and he's still never hit me. How do you know if it escalates? Does it sometimes never get physical until many years later? ",2024-12-04 10:16:05,2025-03-17 03:22:44,abuse

I (30F) have been with my (30M) husband since I was 19. We’ve basically grown up our whole adult lives together. I’ve recently decided to leave, and facing it is making me face some things I’ve been scared of. Maybe I just need to rant, but I’m also scared. 
  
He has never physically hurt me. He has driven recklessly with me while mad, kicked things in the house, but never me. He hasn’t sexually abused me, but he would cry and whine when I said no to sex so much that I would give in. I thought something was wrong with me for not wanting sex. I cried once having sex with him and never told him.
  
He would threaten to throw my cat out, because my cat was having bladder issues. He is always making nasty “jokes” to me that make me upset. If I make a mistake, he gets mad and makes me feel guilty. Once I forgot a bag of groceries at the store, he was also there and forgot, but he blamed me and shamed me for it. It made me cry, I didn’t know he wanted me to grab his bag. Or if I spill/break something he gets mad, things like that. 
  
He doesn’t do any house work or any shared duties and asks me for money all of the time. So I do 50/50 bills with him but also do all of the house work. This is what started my thoughts of divorce, after the 700th argument over the same thing, in which it’s always somehow my fault that he doesn’t clean. Or how I shouldn’t complain because he pays our health insurance. Or how I’m too sensitive or OCD. It’s just ridiculous. He has always pointed out how shitty my friends and family are, and we moved hundreds of miles away. I stopped trusting them. I live with him alone now, far. 
  
There’s a lot more. But just so many years of it, I’m done. I feel emotionally cold towards him. I’m making plans to leave. I have recently discovered that my friends and family ARE on my side and they’re helping me. But I can’t help but feel awful. He’s not going to make it on his own. He couldn’t tell his left shoe from right without me. And I’m leaving him far away, and he needs my money (though he loves to act like he doesn’t). I don’t necessarily worry he’ll hurt me, but I do consider it. I don’t know. I just wanted to rant. I’ve made my mind up, but the build up to talking to him is killing me and eating me away. I’m trying to get my ducks in a row and maybe let him down gently, asking for space, and then separation, and then divorce. But what I really want to do is run back home. It’s a lot. Thanks for listening.

I’m a firm believer that bad people set themselves up to fail. Whether it’s from messing with the wrong person or putting out so much negativity energy/ intentions that it attracts more to them. 

I’ll start with one, feel free to add as many as you like. 

He stole $480 from me and then another $200. Whenever I’d bring up paying me back he’d just yell at me, call me selfish/ stingy, and just generally make me feel awful. Eventually he moved in with me and my parents (his kicked him out) and my mom would charge him $200 for rent each month. She’d put this in a savings account for him to use to get his own place.

Brain fog: this is a trauma response due to the inflammation your brain is experiencing due to the continuous flood of adrenaline and cortisol your brain is experiencing.

2.) Diminished cognitive functioning: this relates to the brain fog. You find yourself having a difficult time executing tasks that require more cognitive thinking. Tasks that are quick and easy are preferred. Difficulty even planning out your day, for example, or for me, a person who loves to cook, a diminished ability to creatively plan a menu, or cook dishes for myself. 

3.) Short term memory lapses and forgetfulness: Like driving to the store, then passing it, then not remembering why you went in the first place.

4.) Disrupted sleep schedule: sleeplessness, combined with the desire to stay up later. Something about those wee hours of the evening belonging to ""you,"" and the time for you to feel safe and think, or retreat. 

5.) Weight gain: Due to a change in eating patterns, constant cortisol production. I found myself not eating much during the day, but then I would ""eat my feelings"" at night. 

6.) Dissociating: Feeling like you are ""checking out"" when with your partner so as to not get emotional and ""rock the boat."" 

7.) Gut issues: Acid reflux, constipation, bloating, etc. Constipation due to the constant activation of fight / flight. Bloating, due to a dysregulated breathing cycle, or literally low-key hyperventilating, causing you to swallow air and bloat up. 

8.) Feeling invisible or like you don't know who you are. You can't even answer the question of what you want for dinner, and stuff like that. You forget about the things you like for the most part. Your partner has zero interest in them, anyways. 

9.) Recovery and disorientation: Needing ""recovery time"" after spending time with your partner, but having trouble coming back to your life and tasks, since those things are not a priority when you are around them. 

10.) Headaches

11.) Isolating self: Some abusers force you to isolate. Others, it's mostly implied or reinforced by them having literally zero interest in your life. Also has to do with shame. You know deep down that what's going on is wrong and are unable to focus on anything else outside of the relationship and managing it, or cycles of guilt, self blame, strategizing how to win back to the times they were nice. So you feel like you don't have anything to offer your friends, and are embarrassed to tell them what is going on anyways. 

12.) Physical pain with no central cause or locus. 

I know there are more. These are what I experienced.

1imhqd6,My Best Friend Survived a Horrific Domestic Violence Attack—And the Police Response Was Appalling,Comfortable_Sock_344,134,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1imhqd6/my_best_friend_survived_a_horrific_domestic/,"Let me tell you about my very best friend.

Yesterday, I spent the entire day supporting my best friend after she survived a brutal domestic violence attack. She was on vacation in Puerto Vallarta with her boyfriend when he assaulted her— pushing her off the bed and then repeatedly slamming her head against the stone floor, biting off two of her fingernails (removing the nail beds), punching, and scratching her. She is severely marked. Hotel staff intervened after she screamed for help three times. She declined police intervention out of fear of his retaliation. She immediately flew back to the U.S., covered in bruises, with a swollen face and a black eye.

I called some national hotlines for advice and they said they couldn't give me any legal advice (which I thought was weird, but okay), but they could share some support groups. I perceived this as paltry.

I then called the San Francisco police to understand what legal steps she could take. The officer on the line told me that she could file a restraining order at the courthouse, which we will do tomorrow. But because it happened outside their jurisdiction (and out of the country), she was ""basically out of luck"" but could file a police report if she ***really*** wanted to, recommending that she should sleep on it. Then he started questioning her story—insinuating that there are ""always two sides"" and that ""sometimes people make things up."" He even suggested that we don’t know *how* her fingernails were torn off, implying that she could have done it to herself.

I was appalled. If I, as a friend calling on her behalf, felt this discouraged, I can only imagine how a survivor in crisis would feel. This kind of dismissive, victim-blaming rhetoric is dangerous and keeps survivors from seeking help.

I want to file a formal complaint about this officer’s response. Does anyone have experience with this? Should I address it to the police commissioner, an oversight board, or another entity? Also, has anyone else encountered similar resistance when seeking help for domestic violence cases?",2025-02-10 21:32:21,2025-03-17 03:24:00,violence

My boyfriend (m/38) and I (f/38) recently had a really traumatic experience that affected me more than him. He took care of me for a few days and then decided he was done and started prioritizing other things. This made me feel really sad and insecure and in a very misguided moment I showed up at his apartment to let him know I needed more support. He had a big job he was preparing for the next day and was clearly annoyed I was there. He asked me to leave and I said no. He then picked me up, dragged me out of the apt and slammed me up against the wall in the hallway several times. I have bruises on my arms and my back.

I feel that what he did was wrong, but I think I was also abusing by violating his boundaries. When we spoke about it after he just kept saying “this is a huge job.” He’s now flown across the country for a week and I feel alone and devastated. I keep thinking of all the things I could’ve done differently and I’m so sad and ashamed. He’s so angry with me. Is there a world in which we survive this?

He has taken over our home office even though I am the only one that works. It is a complete disaster, with piles of crap everywhere, unopened mail from YEARS ago, trash everywhere, just honestly disgusting and so stressful to look at every day. So I finally decided to clean it up. In the process, I moved his pen and calculator. He was already angry I was cleaning up the office but he absolutely blew up at me when he saw I moved his pen and calculator, even though I was able to show him where it was right away. While he was screaming and berating me he got really close to my face, screaming in my face with spittle going everywhere, with a scary crazy look in his eyes. I was scared he was going to hit me. To be clear he has never hit me but he has done this before where he absolutely flies off the handle, slams things, breaks things, and intimidates and scares me. He has zero self control when he's angry. I grew up in a completely dysfunctional home and I'm not willing to stay and raise my children in an environment like this. But just to be clear, is this even classified as anything? Domestic violence, emotional abuse, psychological abuse? Just trying to make some sense of this so I can get some help and figure out what to do.

I'd like to add that he doesn't use his ADHD as an excuse for his anger, I was simply adding that part for context on why I was cleaning the office and why the mess was so bad.",2024-12-19 17:39:58,2025-03-17 03:24:05,violence

There was no physical violence, but he was shouting/yelling at me, expressing anger by pounding his fists, throwing/slamming things around, keeping me awake for hours arguring in circles, and threatening to tear the whole apartment up. He had this out-of-control scary look in his eyes, and is just so rageful and volatile over extremely minor things.

This is not the first episode he's had (he's had emotional/verbal abuse episodes every 1-2 months on average), but for some reason, it's the one that's stressed me out the most. He's never harmed/hit me, but he's done a lot of verbal/emotional abuse and breaks things/throws stuff around when he's angry. I was also in the middle of final exams for my graduate program, so I was already under a lot of stress. My mind and body have just been in a state of extreme shutdown and not functioning very well. I've dealt with the abusive episodes better in the past, for some reason this one really scared me.

We are taking a break now due to my nervous breakdown and I am considering ending the relationship, but I want more time to clear my head and work things out. 

Is it abnormal to react this way? I feel like I'm overreacting/being too sensitive. Perhaps it could be triggering some past history I have with traumatic events (including sexual assault/rape/strangulation in the past).",2025-01-14 06:29:15,2025-03-17 03:24:10,violence

1fprz5f,Is this emotional abuse? Is it domestic violence?,FriendlyGuess6696,14,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1fprz5f/is_this_emotional_abuse_is_it_domestic_violence/,"I've been married for 10 years. I am thinking seriously about leaving/divorcing. I have been told by a domestic violence hotline that what I am experiencing is domestic violence and emotional abuse. My psychologist has said that she doesn't believe it is - that DV hotlines 'see domestic violence everywhere'. 

As most of you probably know, there are resources out there specifically for people in abuse/DV situations - I do NOT want to be using these resources and taking the opportunity away from others if that's not really what my situation is. 

Here's my situation - sorry it's so long but I want you to have an accurate picture:

* He is critical. Used to be VERY critical (there was one time that in the span of about 2 hours he criticised 40+ things that I did). He's not... insulting. It's much more subtle. So never 'You're fat, you're ugly, you're stupid.' But things like 'Is there a REASON you parked so close to the wall?' or 'You left yesterday's ice pack in his lunch box, haha.' He often makes it sound like he's joking - but it's always something I did wrong. And wrong is any way he wouldn't personally do it. He has genuinely worked on this - I'd say the criticism has reduced by 80%. But it's still there, and it's still daily.
* Any mistake I make, no matter how minor, has to be called out. Again - almost always in a laughing manner. But he rarely just lets little things go. There always has to be blame attached. Our 7-year-old is picking this up and blaming others (or blaming himself and feeling terrible about it) when he makes a mistake. As you can imagine, this has already destroyed my self-esteem - I'm so afraid it's going to destroy our son's, too.
* He won't take feedback or be accountable - he will say 'I did X because you did Y first.' (Our 7-year-old is unfortunately picking this up too.) I was in the hospital recently and asked him nicely to keep his voice down - he was diagnosed with a little bit of hearing loss, and he was speaking loudly in a shared room with other very sick patients just a foot away. His response was 'You should just be grateful I came to visit you at all and stop complaining.' (This is after I visited him EVERY DAY for 6 weeks while he was hospitalised 45 minutes away from us last year.) When I ask him to turn down the music in the car because it's too loud, he says it's not too loud, my hearing is too sensitive, and he gets very annoyed. (Despite knowing he has hearing loss, and knowing kids' ears are sensitive and I'm concerned not just for my hearing but for our son's when he blasts music.)
* He is very easily frustrated with our additional-needs son. This is mostly just raising his voice. There was ONE incident where he physically twisted the skin on his arm to hurt him after he was really frustrated with him (no marks or bruising) - to his slight credit he immediately stopped, told me he needed me to step in, and felt REALLY bad about it and has never done anything like that again (and I don't think he will ever again). I did immediately tell one of our son's medical professionals about this to get him support and make sure it was reported properly. 
* When we remember things differently - it's always my memory that must be wrong. He will never even entertain the idea that he could be incorrect
* We've had 10 years of marriage therapy. There are two things myself and the marriage therapists have been trying to get him to do for the last 10 years: go find his own individual therapist to work on this stuff with (he did.. but only for about 6 months and she didn't work out and he never got another one... that was like 5 years ago), and get more sleep (he will go for 1-2 weeks where he does, but then goes back to old habits). He is chronically sleep-deprived because he stays up until all hours playing games or doing things on his laptop (he's very techy). The sleep deprivation makes him a LOT more critical and a LOT less patient with our son. 
* We divided up the housework responsibilities (we both work full time) - he never does his consistently, and then I have to pick up the slack so our son has a clean place to eat in the morning. 
* He never says thank you for the things I do, but always expects praise when he does even a single chore. 

If this is domestic violence and/or emotional abuse - does anyone have any resources I can point my psychologist to, to show that this type of behaviour is abuse and/or DV?",2024-09-26 09:16:46,2025-03-17 03:24:14,violence

I'm no saint and my insecurities and emotional immaturity contributed to many issues we had but he has been very manipulative, coercive and physically abusive in the last year. 

I've found this sub very helpful, but one thing that seems to be common is that when people's abusers first hit them, they seem to immediately realize what's happened, or at least try to apologise and make ammeds. They will say sorry and promise to change. They won't of course but the initial reaction is still one of recognising it was a bad thing and they should be sorry and express willingness to change. I know there's no one size fits all, but my guy was never really like that. 

He didn't say sorry. He didn't seem to feel bad at all. I think it made him feel really bad about himself, but not for me or for the harm he caused. He would hit me repeatedly, or sometimes just once and the responsibility to be sorry was always on me. A couple of times when he saw the consequences of his actions (a bruise) he would act guilty and say sorry, but if I didn't comfort him correctly he would get annoyed at me for making him feel bad. 

Whenever I tried to talk about it he told me I was abusive, that I was sexually and emotionally abusing him and that my words and actions were worse.

Eventually after a year, and about 5 months since it last happened (I moved out), I messaged him and he apologized and said I didn't deserve it and it was wrong. But he also implied that I wasn't innocent and that it's convenient that I don't remember my behavior that caused it.

Basically I think he thinks I deserved it, even though he would never say that outright. He is all about accountability and taking responsibility when it comes to my behavior, but with this I felt like I had to chase him to get him to even show remorse. One time he even said that he could 'get away with it' because he couldn't see my bruises as they were all under my clothes. He thought I was just fine because I wasn't complaining or visibly hurt, but I was hardly going to complain to him? 

I've talked about this in therapy and with a close friend and both have expressed major concerns about his initial response to his violence. I guess I just wanted to vent a bit here, and see if anyone else's abuser was like this. ",2025-02-23 01:36:22,2025-03-17 03:24:17,violence

She has always been a girl of excellent grades and recognition, but she's also socially awkward. She doesn't have a good relationship with her parents and, over time, has become more and more isolated. Her life is only about her husband and her job.

She got married a few months ago, and I can tell something is off. Her husband is a former deputy prosecutor in Mexico. When I first met him, he wasn't kind—only short words came out of his mouth, and he had a very haughty way of sitting. You could notice he didn't care to meet me or any of my friend's friends.

I also know he is very classist and speaks very poorly about migrants in Mexico, such as Venezuelans. Also, he's really paranoid when my friend goes out, even just for a coffee. Last time, she and another female friend went out for a coffee and then went for a walk nearby, and the guy became angry because, in his words, my friend was risking his wife’s life.

On their wedding day, my friend met his relatives for the first time, which was weird because they had been dating for about three years at that moment.

The wedding had an awkward atmosphere. Like I mentioned before, my friend's relatives weren't there—not a single one of them. Only me and some more friends, maybe like 10 people, were from her side.

My boyfriend and my friends are the kind of men who are affectionate, but my friend's husband and his brother were rude, shouting slurs at them, like ""putos"" (a derogatory term for gay people). And my friend wasn't saying anything. The wedding was weird, to be honest. I didn't see the joy of happy faces anywhere from anyone.

I haven't seen her since that day, but I know they went to Europe to visit Christmas markets. And she sometimes visits the U.S. for work.

She's more isolated than before, and I think it's going to get worse over time because she doesn't reach out to me or any of our friends anymore. 

To me, it feels like she's not interested in my friendship anymore; she assumes that we will only reunite every year for our other friends' birthdays. I don't know—maybe I'm wrong, but when something is off, most of the time, it's because something really is off.",2025-03-07 22:39:25,2025-03-17 03:24:23,violence

 [Domestic violence and infant abduction in South Korea : r/abusiverelationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1gocz0n/domestic_violence_and_infant_abduction_in_south/)

Sadly, since then Courtney's situation is still desperate and she is fighting to see her son.

Parental abduction and alienation can occur in any country, but it is especially bad in Korea due to a legal system that provides no protection against it. I grew tired of emailing and phoning journalists regarding her case and the issue of parental abduction in general only to receive no reply.  So, I set up a Substack and typed up the kind of essay I felt needed to be written on the subject.

[Korea's Stolen Children 한국의 납치된 아이들 - Reunite’s Substack](https://reunite1.substack.com/p/koreas-stolen-children)

I know this is not the type of post traditionally made in this group, but if it’s allowed then it could be a big help to Courtney and others like her, as I’m trying to get the word out in any way I can.  If you do like what you read, please share it.  I don’t care about copyright, so don’t hesitate to republish all or part of this article anywhere else.

Courtney’s case is far from unique, but it is certainly the most visible right now due to her willingness to speak up. It’s also extra horrifying for a couple of reasons:

One, the court is continuing to side with her ex despite the multiple evidence of abuse, including an event in which he nearly killed his son before he was even born.

Two, that police and social workers were actively involved in taking her baby and then denying their role in it.  A cautious journalist may feel the need to add ‘allegedly’ to that, but having thought on it and looked through the evidence, I have no problem stating in my own work that I fully believe it happened.

Sadly, the defamation laws in Korea mean that many other affected parents are afraid to speak up. There was a couple of other horrifying cases that I was originally hoping to include in the article anonymously, of mothers within Korea who have had their young children taken from them by violently abusive men.  But as of today I hadn’t received a message as to whether it was OK to include their stories, so have omitted them for now.",2025-02-13 02:23:06,2025-03-17 03:24:29,violence

My ex/spouse (27, transmasc) and I got together when I was 17 and in my senior year of high school. They were my first relationship, and they are the only person l've ever had consensual sex with. After maybe 6-ish months of dating, I told my ex that l was repeatedly raped by a 24 y/o man up until about a month before we got together. My ex did not take it well, and they blamed me for what happened. They were convinced that I ""wanted it"" and that I cheated on them, even though the assaults happened before we our first date. After that, they started getting more violent towards me. They would rape me as a form of ""punishment"" when I upset them. I would also regularly wake up to them penetrating me or touching me sexually. At some point during our relationship, sexual assault became a pretty much a daily occurrence. I lived in a constant state of fear and deep hopelessness that led to severe suicidal ideation. Towards the end of our relationship, my ex acknowledged some of the violence they inflicted upon me, but ultimately, they could not stop crossing my boundaries sexually. As a result, we broke up this past spring, and I moved out a few months later.

It's now been 8 months since I was last sexually assaulted; this is probably the longest time I have gone without experiencing sexual assault since I was at least 12 years old. I am finally in a space where I can start to process the trauma and abuse l've endured, and I am fortunate to be able to do a lot of that in therapy. More recently, l've been thinking about healing from sexual trauma & exploring my sexuality. At some point, I would love to have sex with someone who is not also my rapist. That said, I'm really nervous about the thought of having sex with someone, and I want to be very intentional about who I am engaging with. I am also somewhere on the demisexual/gray ace spectrum, and I very rarely experience sexual attraction. I've tried exploring on my own through masturbation, but I often find myself feeling overwhelmed with flashbacks of sexual assault and/or I find myself thinking about my ex, which results in me feeling a lot of shame.

All that to say, I'm wondering what your experiences with solo and/or partnered sex have been like post-sexual trauma. What has helped you heal? Were there specific types of therapy you found useful? Are there resources or books you would recommend? I'm especially interested in hearing stories of other queer and trans survivors of sex assault and IPV, but I would love to hear from anyone!",2024-12-28 03:31:55,2025-03-17 03:24:30,violence

So while working on transcribing the audio recordings of past incidents, I found myself frustrated by how the plain text utterly failed to capture the full emotional and psychological reality of those moments. The transcriptions just could not convey the intensity in voices, the environmental context, or the physical and emotional dynamics of situations like when I would retreat to the driveway. It just fell flat 

What started as simply adding emphasis with all caps and scene descriptions evolved gradually, I've ended up with a short story that captures my lived experience in a way that raw transcription couldn't. The process of transforming these difficult painful deeply traumatic memories into a structured narrative has been unexpectedly therapeutic, helping me process and contextualize these experiences in a new and different way.

9:30 PM

September 23, 2021

Nine-thirty found her pressed against dark hardwood, copper hair splayed around her shoulders, each breath shallow and measured against the thunder of his footsteps. Don't move don't breathe don’t exist - her body desperate to vanish into floor grain, become sawdust and shadow. His footsteps heavy, pacing now closer closer - please universe collapse please floor swallow whole - traitor lungs hitching sharp little mouse-breaths that scream prey prey prey into the predator dark. 

Kitchen to living room. Down the hall. Back again. His bulk stealing oxygen with each pass. Her hundred pounds pressed against wood floors that held years of similar terrors in their grain. His two-fifty claiming every inch until air turned solid with threat. 

""Worthless fucking cunt."" 

Words like stones, bouncing off walls while the dogs melted into basement shadows. The house held its breath, walls contracting with menace.  Time drowned in the metronome of his rage.

""Get out get out GET OUT"" 

Closer now, steps heavier. 

""LEAVE! RUIN YOUR OWN LIFE!""

The familiar choreography unfolded—measured approach disguised as reasoning, false calm before the storm. Her shoulders curved inward as his shadow fell across her face. Her breathing quickened, short desperate gasps betraying the terror she tried to contain. Muscles seized tight against the certainty of what came next.

""What makes you leave all the other weeks?!"" 

Each question brought him nearer, air displacement pushing against her skin. Her lungs burned faster now, throat closing as his bulk blocked out light. ""What are you waiting for?"" The derisive mockery carrying more menace than shouts. 

""AREN'T YOU SCARED?""

She pressed deeper into the ancient planks, mind straining toward somewhere far beyond his looming presence, beyond the weight of space collapsing around her lungs, beyond this infinite moment pregnant with violence. Phone clutched tight. Whispers catching between ragged breaths: ""It's nine-thirty and he's beaten my head in... and I'm laying on the floor in the foyer...and…I’m laying on the floor… and he’s beaten my head into the floor. I’m done. I cannot fucking do this. This is insanity..""

Truth compressed into timestamped audio while terror stole air.

Survival begged stillness. Smallness. Submission never enough but instinct curling her tight anyway. Become nothing nothing nothing - if cells could dissolve into air molecules maybe he’d forget - just empty space just dead air please - stuttering breaths shattered the nothing she needed to be. His tread vibrating through floorboards into her bones. Rage and sweat closing in.

""You're not happy here?! LEAVE!!"" 

His voice perturbed by her very existence. 

Malevolent.



""Get the FUCK out!"" 

*IMPACT*

The words exploded against her skull, 

followed by a sharp crack as his palm 

connected with her head.



""HEY! Ya heard me??”

*IMPACT*



""GET-THE-FUCK-OUT. GET-OUT!

*IMPACT IMPACT*

Each command 

puncuated 

fueled fury



""HEY! HEY! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???"" 

*SMACK SMACK SMACK*

reality fractures 

between strikes



""Why-are-you-still-here, CUNT?!”

*IMPACT IMPACT*



""AREN’T YOU AFRAID?"" 

His palm smacked against her eye socket again.



""HUH?!"" 

*IMPACT* 



""Get-out-get-out-get-out-GET-OUT-GO!!!!!” 

His fury orchestrating violence 

Palm conducting agony 

Each strike precise 

Each word timed 

to 

maximum impact



Until finally—

""I swear to fucking God, Sam—

**GET!!**

**OUT!!**"" 

""OOOWWWWWWWW!!!"" She recoiled in pain and howled in tears, his final words delivered another smack into her face. Something inside her shattered. Sobs ripped from deep in her chest, primal wails that echoed off walls. 

“GOD DAMMIT THERE IS SERIOUSLY. SOMETHING. FUCKING. WRONG WITH YOU! There. Is. something. SO FUCKING WRONG WITH YOU!”

Tears burned hot down her cheeks while her voice climbed higher, hysteria clawing up her throat. Her wailing 

""WHY??... WHY?? WHY IS IT…WONT YOU JUST TELL…"" 

The questions dissolved into wordless keening while his hands found her again clamping over face, palm muffling screams, and her terror crystallized into rage.

""**YOU GET THE FUCK OFF OF ME!**"" 

Her small body surged against his bulk, survival overriding terror. 

""YOU GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME! STOP IT STOP"" 

But two hundred fifty pounds of hatred drove her down, hardwood slamming against knees and palms. Her elbows scraped across floor as she crawled, his footsteps thundering behind, around, over her hunched form. 

""GET AWAY!!! 

LEAVE! 

ME! 

ALONE!!"" 

Each word tore raw from her throat: rage fuel

""I AM CRAWLING.  THROUGH.  OUR ENTIRE FRONT ROOM. WHILE YOU JUST STOMP..ME…"" 

Her voice cracked on the truth of it - this war zone hidden behind these walls, this nightmare playing out on old wooden floors while neighbors slept unaware. His shadow fell across her again and again

'Are you going to LEAVE then?' His voice dropped to that velvet-wrapped menace she dreaded most. 'Are you going to leave then? CUNT?' Poison dripped from each syllable. 

Rage exploding now point-blank, control evaporated like gasoline catching spark–

'LEAVE!! LEAVE!!' 

'AND. YOU'LL. NEVER. 

HAVE. TO. WORRY. ABOUT. IT. AGAIN!' 

The words now barely escaped between his gasping breaths.

She tried to stand, but his hands found her from behind, massive fingers digging into flesh. 

'Why are you still fucking here? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?'

Fury blazed through her terror, unable to move in his grip, her voice turning razor-sharp with mockery: 'Yeah, you like that? You little fucking bitch!' 

The words threw his own tactics back at him, savage satisfaction flaring as she claimed his language for her weapon. His raw fury ripped through the air– soundwaves slamming her backward.

 'WHAT ARE YOU, BITCH?! WHAT ARE YOU?'

Something snapped inside her chest. 'You beat people's HEAD IN...BEAT MY EYE IN SOME MORE BITCH!!'

""BEAT MY FA—OOOOWWWWW!"" The word fragmented into a primal scream that echoed off walls while tears choked her throat. Her voice cracked and broke, each sob punctuating her words: 

""GOD DAMN IT. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU??? SOMETHING IS SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH YOU! FUCKING BULLY!!! THIS IS ALL YOU ARE"" 

“UNDERSTAND THAT!!!”

His massive frame pressed closer, trapping her between wall and rage. She could taste her own fear but something else rose beneath it—fury at this entitled destruction of her body, her safety, her reality. 

""GET OUT OF MY FACE!! GET OUT OF MY FACE GET OUT OF MY.."" Her voice climbed higher, raw truth tearing from her throat–

dictating darkness

""YOU ARE BACKING ME INTO CORNERS YOU ARE A BULLY!!""

Her howls echoed off walls while tears choked her words. But still she named it, each brutal truth punctuated by pain: ""You think... you can just... BEAT PEOPLE…INTO SUBMISSION!""

His hand found her throat then, two hundred fifty pounds of focused hatred crushing her hundred-pound frame against unyielding surfaces. Kitchen counter. Windows. Corners. Each new prison forcing desperate garbled gasps and terrorized shock.

""Get THE FUCK away from me!"" Survival and rage tangled in her chest. 

""You're backing me into the counter screaming in my ears!"" 

Even through tears, even through terror, she kept naming his violence. Each impact drew fresh cries but couldn't silence the steel in her spine: 

""This is what you are! THIS is ALL you fucking are!""

Open hands never formed fists. Clean bruises blooming beneath skin. This wasn't chaos, this was calibrated cruelty –

violence refined to art. 

Her small frame writhing against futility while his voice shredded raw:

 ""GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT!!!!!""

Phone clutched tight one moment. Documentation whispered into darkness. Then - survival detonating through muscle and bone. Neither silence nor screams saved her. Both paths led to the same destination.

Muscle memory now. The familiar dance of gathering essentials while rage saturated their home's corners. Bag handles cutting palms. His fury keeping time. How many nights had she tried to pack to this soundtrack? How many escapes ended at his bulk in doorways?

“I don't need your help.” Her voice cracked against the words, throat raw from screaming. Inside lights cast harsh shadows while she fumbled for her things, each movement a choreography learned through countless nights like this one. 'What are you doi—'""

""HERE YA GO!!"" Launched with sadistic force, the bag connected with her face as space collapsed. Shockwaves. Stumbling. Backward. He advanced - loathing filling the shrinking distance. His mind collapsing into eight-year-old spite wielding grown man’s power

""OH MY GOD!!!!! There is SOMETHING SO WRONG WITH YOU!!! WHAT THE FUCKING- FU-FUCK ME..."" The syllable shattered in her throat – truth tore out between desperate gasps before his palm found her face. Primal terror. Muffled panic leaks between fingers. Her hands wild - grabbing, scratching, shoving. Wrist caught mid-swing - twisted back. 

Can’t breathe can’t breathe. Primal instinct. Terror. Body thrashing. Bucking blind against his raw distortion– entitlement to her breath.

His grip breaks. Oxygen flooding back ignites truth in her primal desperation: 

""You're going to kill me, literally fuc—""

Pure delusion twisting survival into assault:

""Oh you want to headbutt people now?!""

How dare she fight to breathe while his coward hands claim that right. The twisted logic of his rage - as if her desperate gasp for air was assault. Survival itself was defiance.

""YEAH WHEN PEOPLE ARE ATTACKING YOU!!!!""

His warped brain spinning deeper into deranged distortion. His fury erupts at the audacity to breathe without consent. Captured again. Hand clamping savage over her mouth and nose. Raw fear, primal screams dying against crushing pressure. Muffled panic. Words die silent. His grip seals tighter. Twisted entitlement corrupted the fight for oxygen into deliberate rebellion deserving merciless retribution.

Vindictive child-mind spinning violent behind grown muscle, petulant rage claiming savage dominion. Perverse entitlement contorting survival itself as deliberate provocation. Unforgivable defiance. Her refusal to suffocate quietly was an assault against his authoritarian delusion. Her spine arched wild against the wall. Her body a desperate animal. Nerve endings ignited primal instinct, she twists and bucks. She breaks free. Bolting. Running. 

Raw infant wails, lungs fighting for scraps of air between terror’s static. Her body had forgotten how to be anything but small, anything but helpless - producing sounds no grown throat should hold - diving deeper into the primal brain stem where language dissolved into pure newborn panic. Like a baby abandoned in the darkness. 

Fabric rustled, feet stumbled, her body staggered toward the door. 

Escape. 

Reality blurred at the edges - mind drowning in terror while survival dragged her forward 

Seconds lasting years, hours compressed to microseconds, reality strobing like dying fluorescent bulbs

Each breath came 

shorter 

shorter 

shorter.



Then - crickets. 

The night air shocking skin alive, past flowerbeds hiding hell behind their blooms. The truck's tire caught her collapse - rough rubber salvation against her spine while the knees finally betrayed her. 

Silence pressed in, broken only by cricket song and her ragged breathing slowly steadying against the night air. Inside that house he stalked and raged, texts firing like bullets into the fragile bubble of escape she'd carved in this driveway. Her phone glowed accusation after accusation. 

""I don't even know what to do."" 

The whisper into her phone disappeared into darkness. 

""I don't understand what the fuck I am supposed to do…""

Each repetition smaller, 

smaller,

smaller,

more 

and 

more

lost. 

""There’s nothing to do but just sit here…. 

“There is…nothing...""



The night air chilled sweat against her skin while messages stacked higher. Each passing headlight made her shrink smaller against rubber and shadow, praying

no one would see, 

everyone would see. 

The tire's solid curve against her back offered more safety than their whole house had in years.

""I cannot.. fucking.. do this"" 

Her voice…

""This is crazy""

barely carried past her lips.



“This is so fucked up–

“What– what am I supposed to do?”

Cricket song swallowed the words. Then - a single owl call pierces night air, its hollow who-who-who echoing accusation across suburban dark. She pressed harder against solid rubber. Her flesh desperate to quantum tunnel through this cold concrete beneath her, through earth’s core, through reality itself. Her lungs struggled toward a steady rhythm, wondering how long before she'd have to abandon this temporary sanctuary and face whatever waited behind that front door. 

""If he does..."" Her whisper trailed into still darkness. The owl's question haunting empty air: who will help, who will see, who will stop this? 

Rubber and concrete sanctuary measured in heartbeats. Tire treads pressing patterns into her trembling spine while her mind raced dark corridors of what-ifs. Seven minutes? Ten? Thirty? Time dissolves between insect chorus and terror's countdown. Nature’s metronome keeps counting while her world implodes.

Her legs trembled standing - knees liquid with dread. Each footstep toward that door forced stale air through lungs that begged to run instead. The porch light throwing sinister shadows across innocent petunias. Her garden - silent witness to everything, revealing nothing. 

First breath fights gravity

Second breath battles terror

Third 

wages war

Fourth 

surrenders to fear

Fifth 

accepts fate

Sixth 

door opens—

Hinges betrayed her with a whisper.

His fury found her first -  his towering shadow eclipsing hallway light. Hours of rage had sandpapered his voice raw but hatred dripped fresh: 

""Get the fuck out of my fucking life. Get the fuck out and LEAVE!!! And stay out you worthless fucking cunt"" 

His rage shoved her smaller form through labyrinths of false escape, each exit becoming a trap, until walls consumed final inches of retreat.

The laundry room caught her collapse. Knees hit tile while chemical-clean air filled lungs too tired to scream anymore. Gravity release these bones please let them float past atmosphere, past knowing, she prayed. 

His footsteps thundered past - closer, farther, closer again, marking time like a metronome of horror. But something shifted in the rhythm of his rage, paces growing slower, voice dropping from roar to growl to mutter to silence.

Exhaustion—

collapse. 

Sleep ambushed her there. Warmth leaked from dryer vents while tile stole heat from heavy limbs. Moonlight painting strange shadows through laundry room glass. Time dissolved between fabric softener sheets. One hour bled into two, consciousness floating somewhere far beyond the laundry basket pressed against her feet.

His voice found her in darkness. 

""Love? Love...Sweet babeh? 

Wake up, sweet love"" 

Gentle now. Honeyed. Nearly a whisper. 

Confusion fogged her mind while reality crashed back in waves. Her body remembered before her mind could catch up. Time spiral backward dissolve forward scatter sideways anything but now. Her lungs seized. Each desperate gasp birthed another wave of primal sound until she was drowning in it, consciousness fracturing under the warped weight of now.

""My love, please come with me” he whispered. 

“Please, sweet babe.”

And something in her splintered. Those tender words twisted through her skull like barbed wire, each syllable carving new pathways of pain while her throat worked around sounds she didn't recognize as human. Each moment both infinite and instantaneous

Time stretched and warped–

she was five, 

fifteen, 

twenty-five, 

trapped 

in an endless loop 

of terror 

while her adult mind 

watched 

from somewhere 

far away. 

""Promise me,"" she begged between guttural gasps, ""promise me..""  

“I swear, sweet love, I swear”

His gentle tone gouged at places already bleeding, 

“I promise you. I promise you. Please trust me, sweet baby."" 

Her words dissolved into pure primal sounds,

“Promise me…” though she couldn't remember what she was begging for anymore.  

Exhaustion dragged her under on puppet strings, her feet moving without permission. His massive frame guided her stumbling steps toward their bed, toward the ritual that followed violence like a twisted prayer. In bed, her body betrayed her last defenses curving into his warmth like a wound seeking salt. His heartbeat drummed against her ear, steady and sure while hers still fluttered with terror in her throat. His fingers traced gentle patterns on her back and she pressed closer, desperate for warmth, for comfort, for the familiar touch, any touch, even soaked in threat. 

Morning waited with its hollow promise of redemption while part of her floated somewhere near the ceiling, watching this broken girl vanish into the barbaric tenderness of his arms. Body nothing but raw nerve endings seeking relief yet screaming wrong wrong wrong while begging closer closer closer, betraying every survival instinct as she sought desperate refuge in her wreckage, his wreckage, dignity drowning in the twisted solace of his embrace.

1gocz0n,Domestic violence and infant abduction in South Korea,dinoboy106,13,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1gocz0n/domestic_violence_and_infant_abduction_in_south/,"Hi all.

I'm posting here to try and help a friend who is currently trapped in South Korea and is fighting to see her baby again after he was kidnapped by her abusive husband.

This will be a MUCH longer post than is normally shared here, but for anyone who can give me the time and read through to the end I'd be most grateful, as there are ways to help this woman.  Her story is already very public, hence using her real name.

Courtney Lynn is an American woman who was living in South Korea alongside her two young daughters. She began dating a Korean man who she had initially met in the USA. At first the relationship went well. He was charismatic, supportive and seemed to genuinely care for her and her daughters. However, soon after they married and Courtney became pregnant his character switched, and the verbal and physical abuse began.

Courtney approached her in-laws to alert them to what their son was doing and ask for help, but their response was to ask her what she had done to justify being hit. Both her husband and his parents initially tried to push her into getting an abortion.

When Courtney was 32 weeks pregnant, her husband stormed into the house and threw down divorce papers. As he became increasingly angry Courtney and her daughters fled to a bedroom and locked the door. Her husband tried to force the door down for twenty minutes, screaming he was going to kill her. When she thought he'd calmed down Courtney unlocked the door. Her husband barged it open, the door hitting her in the face. He then proceeded to slap her in front of her daughters, before soaking her with a shower hose and trying to forcibly undress her. She tried to get her two daughters to escape the apartment with her, but her husband blocked them from leaving, claiming mummy was ""just playing a game"".

In the end Courtney fled the apartment in just a bra and pants and ran crying to the nearest convenience store. It was here that she suddenly felt a deep pain in her womb. The store owner called an ambulance. She had gone into early contractions due to being beaten and had to be given medication to prevent herself from giving birth too early. During several days in hospital her husband refused to visit her or pay for anything, callously messaging that he wouldn't care or pay a cent for her or the baby.

When she returned to the apartment her husband coerced her into writing a message that she wouldn't press charges. It was just a few words on a piece of paper, certainly no official document, but he took a photo of it and sent it to the police. When Courtney tried to file a DV case against him a few months later the police said that the note meant that the 'case was closed'.

Once the baby was born, her husband showed no interest in helping to care for their son, and his abuse continued. He would call the police and ask if he could kick Courtney and her two daughters out without reason. When they said “no” he would make up stories of how she had hit him. The police would come round and keep Courtney confined to one room while they listened to only her husband's story. As someone for whom Korean isn't her first language, the police were legally required to bring a translator to talk to Courtney, but they never did.

The police weren't any better when she had to visit the station, which she had to do several times to report violence against her. One rudely asked her to stop crying. Another asked her not to file a case as it was soon time for him to go home and he didn't want to deal with more paperwork.

Her husband would also claim that when Courtney left on the school run with the baby that she was 'leaving with the baby without his permission'. He would block, push and harass Courtney all while she was holding the baby when she tried to leave the apartment, to get a reaction when he filmed her.

Ominously, towards the end her husband started to say that soon he would 'have your baby' and he no longer had any use for her. Tragically on 1st May, it all came true. After another bout of violence, Courtney took her three-month-old son and two young daughters to the police station to ask them to find a place for them all in a woman’s shelter. A family violence worker offered to hold Courtney's baby while she filled in the paperwork. With no reason to suspect anything was amiss, she handed her baby over. Only then did she see that, for reasons that have still never been explained to her, the police had also called in her husband and his mother. The social worker then handed her baby over to her mother-in-law, who put her in a stroller. Courtney tried to reach her baby, but her husband stood in the way, moving to block her. She kept saying, ""she cannot leave with her"", finally getting on her knees and begging repeatedly in Korean for her mother-in-law not to take her baby. The police and social workers did nothing, claiming it was ""just for one night"". Her mother-in-law left in the elevator. When Courtney got home all the baby things were gone.

She messaged her husband in distress, who said that from now on the baby would be staying at his parent's house and she would have no access to him.

When she asked the police for help, they said there was nothing they could do. Parental kidnap is not considered a crime in Korea. So long as one of the parents had the baby, it was considered 'a family matter' that the police don't involve themselves in. By law, Courtney and her husband had 50/50 parental rights. In most countries this would be enforceable, with one parent not allowed to block the other. In Korea 50/50 parental rights means that the police have no involvement in any kind of dispute.

Courtney called at her in-laws apartment and begged to see her baby. They refused and called the police. Eight officers arrived and escorted her out the building for trespassing. She requested the police CCTV that should have captured the moment her baby was taken from her. They refused to release it, then lied and said that Courtney had handed over her baby to her MIL willingly. The family violence counsellors who had given away Courtney's baby discouraged her from getting a lawyer, advising her just to 'be a good wife and then your husband will return your baby. She spoke to the parents at her daughter's school, but no one wanted to get involved. Some even laughed behind her back. Even the US Embassy said they could not provide any help.

Taking the baby had only ever been a way for her husband to control and hurt Courtney. He offered to let her look after their son so long as she signed over sole custody to him. Even more creepily, he offered to give her custody of their son if she signed over custody of her two daughters who weren't even his.

Courtney and her two daughters continued living at the apartment, and she filed a protective order against her husband. Always playing the victim, he also took out a protective order against her, though that didn't stop him from turning up and repeatedly ringing the bell for an hour (she also has this on video), or turning up five minutes after she left the apartment to harass her for the door code. Courtney desperately tried messaging and phoning the police officer in charge of her protective order to get it extended, but he pretended not to have received her calls or messages, which resulted in her ex turning up to throw out Courtney and her two daughters onto the street.

Now in a new apartment alongside her daughters, Courtney finally decided to speak out. She deleted all the old videos from her Youtube Channel 'Courtney the enthusiast'.  She has a Tiktok of the same name.  I won't link in this post as it seems to get me automatically deleted.  Also check out the Youtube channel 'Dark Asia with Megan' and her video 'Korean husband abuses American wife, abducts her child in Korea'.

If you're wondering why Courtney doesn't include the name of her abuser, or any videos that would reveal his face, then the answer is the ridiculously strict libel laws in South Korea. In most countries, you can only sue successfully for libel if someone says something that is provably false. Not so in Korea, where you can be sued even for sharing truthful statements or videos, so long as it's seen as 'damaging someone's reputation'. And as it's near impossible to out an abuser without damaging their reputation, the result is that defamation laws are often used to silence victims. Because of this, Courtney has to be careful not to reveal the identity of her ex. Despite not showing any revealing details, he has still attempted to sue her for defamation, so far unsuccessfully. Not only was she harassed by her ex's lawyer, but the police also phoned to rudely threaten her to take her videos down.

Finally in September she got a court date to file for temporary custody. By this time, as well as having several proven cases of domestic violence against him, her ex was under investigation for child abuse due to his behavior towards Courtney’s daughters, including lifting one from her feet in a chokehold. The judge said that if he were found guilty then temporary custody would change to Courtney. However, for now the court awarded temporary custody to her abusive ex as 'the baby is living with him for now and shouldn't be removed from the home that he is used to'.

It was also clear that no one in her ex’s family was interested in caring for the baby, because according to court documents they had already arranged to put him into daycare come the start of the new year, before he even hit his first birthday.

Courtney was supposed to be given parental visitation rights of two visits per month, but her ex did everything to delay and deny them. He refused to even send her pictures of her son.

Finally, last week Courtney was able to see her son for the first time in six months. It was a relief to finally see him, but she is restricted to one-hour visits twice a month with both a social worker and her abusive ex also present. Social workers condescendingly asked her if looking after the baby would be too much for her, even though she had been his sole carer for the first three months. She was treated as though she was a woman who walked out on her son after three months and must now be cautiously reintroduced to him, not as a mother who has her baby ripped from her and has done everything over the past six months to see him again.

The very latest news is that late last week Courtney heard that her ex had been found guilty of the child abuse charges she had filed five months before. So supposedly her son should be handed over to her for temporary custody, though when and how this will happen remains to be seen. For now, her son is still under ‘the care’ of a man who’s now been found guilty of child abuse.

Since speaking out Courtney has been contacted by a dozen other foreigners in South Korea who have either had their babies taken from them or are staying in abusive marriages because they are told by their spouses and in-laws that they will never see their children again if they speak up or leave.

Things need to change: First, parental abduction in Korea needs to be recognized as a crime. It should be no longer possible for babies to be ripped from mothers and for the police to do nothing for months. As Jay Sung, another parent who suffered from his child being abducted into South Korea, puts it “It is a systemic problem of the Korean legal structure that doesn't prevent parental abduction. It actually encourages it by rewarding the abductor with a de facto custody. Making the Left-Behind-Parent helpless with no means of recovering the child, even with court orders.”

Secondly, truth should be a good defense against libel. Abuse victims in Korea should not be criminalized for revealing their abusers.

I hope that Courtney will be a landmark case that shines the light on what has been allowed to go on for too long within South Korea. If this was just about one mother and her baby, it would still be worth everyone’s effort to reunite them. But it’s not just for her. We need to make sure that not only is she reunited with her baby, but that this doesn’t happen to any parent again. 

Please share Courtney’s story. Send her words of support on her Youtube or Tiktok channels. If you look on her Youtube profile you will find other ways to help her.  If you have any journalistic contacts, please see if they can report on her case.

Thank you anyone who read this far, and thanks in advance for any help you can give.",2024-11-10 22:35:17,2025-03-17 03:24:32,violence
1hxmj8u,Tw: Physical violence and evidence ,relibra,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hxmj8u/tw_physical_violence_and_evidence/,"So when I have been attacked my abuser is very very careful. 

I have had toes broken, strangled multiple times, face aggression is only ever slaps with no closed fist, he has grabs my hair and repeatedly bash my head against a wall till I get a big lump on it. 

I’ve had some bruises from body slams on the floor etc but always sporadic on my body. 

The most violence is probably the head bashes but my hair is SO THICK that NO photograph captures the damage and I don’t want to cut it off. 

He’ll throw me out of a car into road and my knees/hands will be bruised or scraped but just looks like a regular fall.  

I almost feel frustrated. I would rather he had just hurt me in an obvious way so I had the clear pics and evidence. He always did it where it was ambiguous and bruises “could be” just other things. Physical marks were always sporadic 

PS - I am currently are no contact with him and seperated for a while. I am still dealing with trauma and I just was thinking about evidence and the justice system and this came into my head. ",2025-01-09 20:35:01,2025-03-17 03:24:34,violence

Wanting answers to all this disrespectful and denigrating behavior I accepted. We met and he admitted to being wrong about me, admitting to having imagined everything that pushed him to behave so badly (he accused me of cheating on him, of wishing him harm, of making him watch without the slightest explanation, and committed to repairing his mistakes. Once he left, true to himself, he did nothing, leaving me once again without news on Christmas Day, a day that he knows was difficult for me. I meet him the next day, he stops , says hello, asks me if I'm okay, as if nothing had happened... I tell him I lost my godfather, but despite the fact that he experienced the same thing a few years earlier, no reactions. He leaves. sent me a photo of the place where our story began, then nothing... I asked him the real reason for his coming since he had not kept any of his commitments, to which he replied that I had to be lenient and patient!! Which I have largely been for months and months, because being the victim, he was cheeky to ask me that……no more answers…..until the day before December 31st when he sent me a message that I only read on the evening of the 31st where he asked me what I was doing for New Year's Eve to which I replied my first New Year's Eve without him doubly bereaved because the day after the loss of my godfather I also lost a dear friend… he replied “I asked you what you were doing on the 31st!! » I told him that I didn't have the heart to party and even less to feel rejected.... He didn't answer me anymore... However, he seemed sincere when he contacted me, now I just have the feeling that everything was calculated with the sole aim of hurting me during this time of the year that I hardly appreciate....

He has never yelled at me or gotten angry with me. I have seen him get angry at other people and physical with them but never me. But I have always wondered if it would ever happen to me?

He moved out of my area and it seems into an area that doesn't take his shit as much. When police were called regarding my situation the neighbor said I was going to be killed which was accurate. He told me to be quiet while they were knocking and that I couldn't leave. They just knocked and walked away. I would think though they had probable cause to enter the apartment if my life was in danger but nope; they just left me in there. Anyways, he's been being arrested in Florida for domestic violence, assault etc...it seems they too have been letting him pay fines (he has money) and then be released. The latest charges though have to do with robbery, false imprisonment, assault, domestic violence. This pos has occasionally harassed me online and possibly has been reaching out to people I know. I'm wondering why these types keep getting released if they pay fines instead of serving jail time? It's a joke. It's like the system is set up for rich or wealthy people to buy their way out of punishment. If he was poor, I doubt he would be free right now. I'm just disgusted by the way I'm seeing this pattern and not just with him. Anyone else relate to this? Thanks. ",2024-12-25 17:25:02,2025-03-17 03:24:37,violence

I grew up in this house so I know what (Parent2)she's like, she'll throw fits over the smallest of things, and come about as close as she can without actually touching you, she'll break things, punch walls, throw objects in your direction without actually aiming at you, and scream for hours or even days, depending on how much of a fight you put up, this is all from my own experience growing up with her. on occasion even threatening to kill herself if she doesn't get her way, which peaked a few months ago when she, during an episode, smashed a beer bottle down on her seat, while it was in her own hand, then proceeded to bleed profusely throughout the house, slamming doors, hitting walls, screaming about everything, before locking herself up in the bathroom for the night, not to be seen until the following morning having bandaged her hand sometime in between, leaving me and parent1 to clean up the mess she'd made through the house which took several hours due to the carpet.

parent1 is a disabled woman who can operate around the house, but not much else, is she doesn't spend enough time with parent2, there's an argument, if she doesn't take the time to clean while parent2 is asleep, there's an argument, if she she wakes parent2 up whilst cleaning, argument. doesn't have parent2's coffee ready in the morning(parent2 is the only one who drinks it), there's an argument.

there's 2 main reasons the two aren't separated,

\* 1 being that if parent1 files for divorce, parent2 will garnish her disability wages, as parent2 hasn't worked for almost half a decade, making her dependent on that disability wage.

\* 2 being that they adopted a (now)4 year old, and for obvious reasons the child shouldn't grow up like I did around her, but in a divorce parent1 is afraid parent2 will take the kid, which she has threatened several times.

I'm trying to find an argument that will lead to convincing parent1 to leave her on the grounds of abuse which should alleviate both worries of hers, but all I'm finding on Indiana law is the [definition of domestic violence](https://law.justia.com/codes/indiana/2022/title-31/article-9/chapter-2/section-31-9-2-42/), or [definitions of abuse](https://www.in.gov/health/files/abuse_and_neglect_state_defn.pdf) *as it pertains to care facility staff* abusing patients. I was hoping I could get this figured out, because as it stands parent1 has told me her plan is to wait until parent2 actually physically hurts someone, as that appears to be the only merit Indiana law covers under spousal abuse?

I don't know, my head is spinning and parent2 is getting worse, this is the only place I could think to ask.",2024-10-02 22:25:06,2025-03-17 03:24:46,violence
1ggjv5y,My Experience With Gaslighting as a Male Survivor of Domestic Violence,Throwaway-625,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ggjv5y/my_experience_with_gaslighting_as_a_male_survivor/,"If you are a man reading this who is in an abusive relationship please don't be discouraged. Reach out for help. Most reputable, legitimate organizations like the domestic violence hotline believe male victims and take the issue seriously. There is a lot of talk online about how it's so hard for men to find professionals that believe them but it's not really true. Actual professionals know that domestic violence against men exists and they will believe you. At least that was my experience, one of my only regrets is not reaching out sooner. You are not alone.

Sorry for the long post. I'm just writing this to put my feelings to words. It helps me feel sane. If anyone finds any benefit from reading this then that's just the cherry on top.

I was in an abusive relationship about 2 years ago. I was so effectively gaslight by my abuser that not only did I feel crazy, but I felt like a jerk for feeling scared. They would blow up in a violent rage and afterwards when they were calm they would easily be brought back into the violent rage if I tried talking about what just happened, so I would wait for an other day to try to talk about it. Talking about it would often anger them and they would say, ""I'm setting a boundary that we can't talk about this right now because it's too upsetting to me and it's going to send me spiraling, we can talk about this some other time."" I would wait weeks and eventually months to bring up instances of escalating abuse. Eventually they would say that it didn't happen the way I'm describing, I'm making her sound like a monster, and eventually they would say that it didn't happen (all while the abuse is escalating.) Eventually, me bringing up any issue would often result in her getting tremendously angry at me. Most of the worst instances of abuse happened after I tried to talk to her about what was going on.

Once I exited this relationship I immediately started feeling more sane. I was able to piece together what happened and begin to trust my reality. During this time I had to avoid a lot of places and people that I used to spend time with because my abuser was there and I was actively evading her. Months after safely exiting the relationship and when we were no longer living together I tried reaching back out to people and it turns out I was ghosted and essentially excommunicated from most of the people I used to spend time with. To this day I don't really know what was said about me and why people won't talk to me and I probably never will. I am quite alone now. Back when I was seeking help exiting the relationship there were crisis centers hours from me that would take me but I the local shelter wouldn't take me (which was a big deal because I was a student without reliable transportation) because it was full, or maybe because I was a man, I'll never really know. I tried joining a domestic violence support group but they keep pushing back the start date because of logistical hurtles, or maybe it's because they can't accommodate men, I really don't know, it's been almost a year now. I truly believe that it's not because I'm a man but there is a tiny ember burning the back of my mind that thinks it might be. It all makes me feel crazy.

This past year I've been finding it really helpful to write about things that happened to me in my abusive relationship. Writing everything out helps me feel sane. There's a reason why my abuser didn't allow me to talk to anyone about what was going on, because saying out loud what's going on makes it feel real. Posting on reddit, reading what other people have gone through, and communicating with other people digitally has been indispensable for me. It sounds silly but reddit has really helped me and I am grateful to the people I have been able to communicate with on here. However, It can be being a man in what's predominantly a woman's space.

Domestic violence against men is weirdly politicized. Conservative misogynists use hypothetical domestic violence against men to advance their politics and it sows doubt that domestic violence against men exists at all. A redditor recommended to me a podcast called ""Why She Stayed"" which I have really enjoyed, I relate a lot to the woman who puts on that podcast. However, the podcast is centered around female victims and often speaks to the listener assuming the listener is a woman and it makes me feel alienated sometimes. So I looked for podcasts that talk about male survivors. When I searched for ""male victim of domestic violence"" on apple podcasts after I weeded through all the Heard vs Depp crap what I saw was a podcast called ""The Men Need To Be Heard Podcast"". It's a podcast put on by a ""male victim"" of domestic violence and I was eager to listen to it, but after listening to it I think it's a bullshit podcast. The way he talks about DV is not so relatable, the way he talks about reactive abuse, the way he talks about his ex-wife calling him the abuser, and also he says the most abusive thing his ex-wife ever did was suddenly running away with the kids, it all makes me feel more suspicion than comradery. Also most of his content is about conservative politics and custody battles. But then again my abuser has probably said some pretty heinous things about me to make people ghost me the way they did, maybe I'm just being a giant asshole for not believing the guy. The fact that so many abusers claim to be victims themselves and deny any abuse they did is so corrosive to reality that it fills me with despair. Once again I feel crazy.

It's really hard to find first hand accounts from male survivors of DV, but it's relatively easy to find online therapists or news anchors talking about it. It's often spoken about as a super rare occurrence that's a minuscule issue compared to ""normal"" DV. And the accounts of domestic violence against men that are reported on are some of the most horrifying, medieval, psychotic stories I've ever heard. My abuser did a lot of fucked up things to me but they never tied me down, sprayed bleach in my eyes, and cut off my toes. I 110% percent believe those men and they have the scars to prove it but it's hard for me to fully relate to stories like that.

Then I look for statistics online to see how common DV against men is and some say it's 1 out of 3 men, some say it's 1 out of 5 men, some say 1 out of 11 men face DV in their lives and nothing adds up. If it's actually common then why are there so few men who speak up compared to the amount of women speaking up. And when men do speak up it's often embraced by conservative misogynists to further their politics, while simultaneously being dismissed. I have experienced this first hand. It's so bad sometimes when I make a post or write a comment where it's clear that I'm a male survivor of domestic violence the comment is immediately locked, or my post is immediately deleted. I don't really know why it's deleted, but not knowing actually makes it worse. I could easily go on some MRA sub and post about my experience and a bunch of people would engage but they are mostly shitty and fake, there's a difference between people engaging with you and people seeing you. I want to feel seen. I feel so crazy that I feel a creeping self doubt and I have a need to stand up and say exactly what happened to me, because I know exactly what my abuser did to me even if it doesn't make sense to the rest of the world. I exist and what happened to me was real, even if nobody else ever knows, even if nobody would believe me if they knew.",2024-10-31 17:20:59,2025-03-17 03:24:47,violence

After years of enduring his harsh words, she hauls off and punches him in the face. Is she the abuser or is she just a victim reacting to his abuse?


That leads me to my next question: is one act of violence necessarily classified as abuse? I’m not referring to the above scenario. Generally speaking, is a spouse considered abusive because s/he hits their spouse one time?

1f690oz,[TW: domestic violence] Conflicted: I managed to leave but only because someone else came into my life,laurelei3D,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1f690oz/tw_domestic_violence_conflicted_i_managed_to/,"I was with my ex for a year and then we spent 2 years on and off after I initiated a break up. These have been the worst years of my life so far. I genuinely thought the only way I could escape would be to end my life. I just couldn't bring myself to leave him. He was my biggest source of pain but my only comfort after he hurt me. 

Now it's been a week since I broke up again for the nth time. He had me pinned against a wall, strangling me and blaming me for provoking him. He slapped me, dragged me by my wrist as I tried to escape through the front door. When I realised I felt completely numb and was just patiently waiting for him to stop strangling me, something clicked in my head. I had enough and told him to leave once he calmed down. I blocked him on everything as soon as he left my place. A few hours later I get a friend request from an old classmate I had a bit of a crush on. When he messaged me, I was elated. It hadn't been 24 hours since I left my ex that I was texting the day away with another guy. 

We went on a date 2 days ago and I had an amazing time. He was sweet and attentive and treated me amazingly throughout the evening. I'm very suspicious of his intentions unfortunately due to my trust in men having been completely destroyed. Due to this, I'm very hesitant and overly observant/paranoid. He texts me throughout the day and I can't help thinking he's manipulating me and hiding his abusive side. Anyway, that's another story.

I'm unsure how to feel about this whole situation. I wish I was strong enough to leave on my own. I'm disappointed in myself that it took another man to ""save me"". I could never do it myself. I've lost count of the amount of times I left my ex and told myself that was the last time. My mum doesn't know the extent at which I kept seeing my ex. She always praised me for being brave enough to leave an abusive relationship. This whole time I was lying to her because I was too weak to leave.",2024-09-01 07:41:56,2025-03-17 03:25:02,violence

1ehv3m6,I was so focused on his physical violence that I (F27) didn't notice the sexual abuse until 10 years later,Few-Chapter1719,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ehv3m6/i_was_so_focused_on_his_physical_violence_that_i/,"He was my best friend since we were 12. 
We started dating when I was 17, he was 18.
He was fun and kind, the ""shy geek"" type. Always supportive to me. It just made sense. I fell in love, and got stuck in a nightmare. 

I had to move for my studies, so we engaged in a long-distance relationship and saw each other whenever we could, each month or so. 


We were in a relationship for 3 years, we broke up because of his physical violence (at its peek, he strangled me and threatened to kill me, I had to escape).

I didn't know about any type of violence other than ""physical"" really. Only now do I see sexual abuse in his acts. I felt deeply ashamed for a very, very long time. I still feel a bit ashamed tbh. And so dumb. I hope that I can either help or distract someone by listing my stupid mistakes. 


Something always felt wrong whenever he talked about sex. He had this creepy tone which made me very uncomfortable. 

He tried to convince me that each and every person around me who was nice to me was secretly wanting sex from me. 

EACH and EVERY one. 
Man or woman. 
Could be a classmate, a teacher, a bus driver a cashier, a random guy in the street, a friend, a family member (?!), anyone. 

It I told him about my day, like about that nice lady whose always so cheerful at the bakery, he'd rewrite the story, telling she was so horny for me she couldn't hide it. And so on.

He wasn't jealous : he was hyped.
I often told him no, it wasn't like that. He wasn't even there ! 
He told me I was too naive, that the person definitely wanted to fuck. Started to describe gross pictures, to ask gross questions, to ask for details. I said I didn't want to answer. 

He tried to convince me that I definitely wanted sex with these people too. Tried to convince me that I was bisexual, while I was pretty sure I was straight. (still am pretty sure, but it confused me) 

He told me constantly that I was sooo lucky to have a boyfriend like him, whose okay with me having sex with other people. 

I told him I only loved him, and wouldn't want to have sex with anyone else. The idea of having sex with someone I don't love has always been disgusting to me. I'm very monogamous.

Day after day, he insisted. I was always sleep-deprived, because he was using constant emotional blackmail and I fell for it. Always breaking my boundaries, always wanting more from me. More time with him on the phone at night. ""Just a few more minutes"" until 1 or 2am (or later). I wasn't doing so well in my studies with so little sleep.

He had this twisted version of the world in mind. Asking multiple times if I masturbate at work, at school during class, in the train. Always told him that of course no I don't ?! 
So he begged me to try. I refused each time. He got angry, and mean. One time I wanted peace from him, so I just lied and told him I did it. I thought it would suffice to feed the beast inside him. Instead he asked many gross specific stuff. I was uncomfortable about this, I felt dirty, and decided I wouldn't lie to him again as I hate lying

He begged for nudes constantly too, for phone sex, and I hated that. Whenever I refused, he became very mean and hurtful, or hung up the phone. Used my weaknesses against me. Said that I didn't love him. That nudes were absolutely mandatory as we were in a long-distance relationship most of the time. Sometimes he even threatened to cheat on me. (Well, turns out he did cheated once) 

When I did send nudes, it wasn't enough. It was even worse, because he begged from more. A specific angle or a specific body part. Request like the use of toys on the pics even. Zooms. I told him I really didn't want to, and wasn't into that. I found that disgusting. 

Told him I was so very tired (which was also true, it was always so late at night). That I needed to sleep. That I really didn't want to take pictures, or to turn some lights on. 

His reaction was always first trying to be bubbly, and gentle and kind and supportive and smiling when asking for nudes/phone sex... And becoming very mean and threatening when I refused. He had two opposite faces, and the switch was fast. 


The worse part of the sexual abuse for me was that after months of sleep deprivation, he somehow managed to convince me to try sleeping with someone else. 

I told him repeatedly that I didn't want to. He told me each day that he would be so proud of me. That he loved me, and knew I could do it. That I was so lucky to get to try sex with someone else. He told me that we would spend our whole life together, that he wanted me to try with at least one other person to not be disappointed when I'm older. 

He asked me to sleep with one of my friends. So I did. And it was a terrible experience, because technically it wasn't rape, but I didn't wanted this. I felt ashamed for years afterward. 

And my abusive boyfriend was happy... For a while. Like he couldn't believe I did it, after months and months of sleep deprivation and repeating every single day what he wanted, I finally done it. 

Well... It wasn't enough. He asked for more. He begged for more. I begged him to stop being a jerk. Told him how terrible it was. 

He used his kind, loving, supporting voice again, and repeated that deep down, he knew I wanted this, and knew it would please me next time, because he knew me better than anyone. He asked me to trust him. 

I slept with 4 other guys for him. Took no pleasure in it, only shame and sadness, those were terrible, traumatizing moments. Ten years later, I can't believe I let all of this happen. It seems like another me, in another life. 

One time he even planned a threesome with an older random man on an app, as a surprise for my birthday??? I said ""definitely no, won't happen"", and he tried to guilt me, saying how disappointed this man will be, that it's already set... Creep. At least I dodged this bullet. 

I was dumber than dumb. But I was so young, around 18, and I really wanted him to be ""the one"". I never wanted to fix him. I wanted to fix the relationship, so that we could be happy again . 

All I ever wanted was to get to hear his cheerful voice again. I wanted him to be his normal self, the fun, loving guy I knew he could be, because he was at first. This ""shy geek"" who was my best friend since I was 12.

Grieving people that are still alive is so hard. 
Unloving someone is so hard. 

I'm so glad I'm not in love with him since years now, so the spell is gone, and I blocked this asshole. 

I saw him last year though, he swore we would only see each other as childhood friends, not as exes. He made me feel silly for thinking otherwise, saying stuff like ""come on, we were merely high-school sweathearts, we're both adults now who moved on with our lives, and can see each other as friends"" 

Then he tried to rape me and said ""I wanted to test your boundaries"" sooo I'm all about second chances and all, but I'm done for life with this guy. Some people don't change one bit, even years later

I wish I could have seen the abuse earlier. I feel lighter just being able to talk about this now. ",2024-08-01 23:27:16,2025-03-17 03:25:06,violence

Her father, brothers, even a random hairstylist in our small town. About a month ago her house burned down. He happened to drive by while it was happening.. not as if he was just in the neighborhood. He lives about 40 miles away from her. At this time I knew it was him that burned her house down. Idk why.. I just felt it. She hadn’t yet excepted the fact that he did this. Until, about a week later she stayed at a friends (being homeless now) that night she was afraid. So her and her friend left and went and stayed at her friends sisters two towns over instead. That night, her friends RV burns to the ground. Where they were supposed to be sleeping.. Again, police were called. Nothing was done. They took a report and nobody heard another word about it. Now she has her own place and got a new phone to try and keep him from tracking and finding her. Well he found her. He sent out more sec videos. He pulled up late about a week ago and went around the back of the house. Knocked a small hole in her bedroom window and threw a lit flare inside. Caught the wall and curtains on fire. She was at work but her room mate was there and heard a noise. Luckily he was able to put out the fire and then run outside to see her EX BOYFRIEND jumping in the driver seat of his ex wife’s vehicle and hauling ass away. Again, cops were called. They said there was nothing they could do. 
Now I need to mention that in between the fire events her ex also showed up at her mothers and loosened her dads lug nuts in the middle of the night. Tried to break into her son a rv on her mom’s property and the neighbor saw him. When the neighbor yelled her ex jumped on his motorcycle, hauled ass. A red car comes around the corner, hits a deer launching at her ex KNOCKING HIM OFF HIS BIKE and he ends up being rushed to the er with bad injuries. Cops were called again. Now they have more witnesses and more proof he’s doing these things. Unfortunately the cops said they can’t do much. Maybe a trespassing citation. But since nobody saw him loosen the lug nuts , there was nothing they can do. He has in the passed week snuck up
To her house and busted out her back windshield TWICE! In the last week! Costing her $299. Each time!! Cops called and still nothings been done. She has forwarded their messages to the police and tried everything. This is happening in south Texas. Why on gods earth are the police not doing anything? That wreck he was in, shouldn’t that have been feeing the seen of a crime since he was running from getting caught on her mom’s property? With witnesses!! What about the two fires and the flare? Is this not enough evidence! Shouldn’t that be assault with a deadly weapon? Arson? What in gods name is going on here???

Last night, my boyfriend of three months, his brother and his sister in law were playing pool and having some beers. BF was quiet the whole night but we were play fighting on and off. He is a lot bigger and stronger than me but we do play fight frequently no worries, in a kind of affectionate way. 

Last night however when things were wrapping up, we were gently play fighting and his whole face suddenly changed and he threw me onto the ground and I hit a table. Even his own brother asked me if I was ok. We finished the game and little was said but obviously the mood had dramatically changed. He left with his brother and I stayed with SIL for a bit and became a bit tearful from the fright I got and she agreed it was bad and his out of the blue throwing me was shocking and scary. 

Queue going to bed after. He denies throwing me and says I just slipped, basically gaslighting me. Argument continues, he agrees he hurt me but it was an accident and “he just gets angry sometimes”. Unsure what to do or think, I really love this guy and he’s the only person I’ve genuinely thought about marrying - this has quite literally thrown me.

I would encourage you guys not to victim blame - that I should have known better and recognized his red flags sooner but he was an expert manipulator, pathological liar, egotistical narcissistic who lovebombed me in the beginning to coerce me to do things I never felt comfortable with. He bullied me and I can go on and on about everything because I am actually considering starting a podcast to share my experience to educate the public. Sorry I'm rambling but anyway he would accuse me of being a snitch but he never deserved my loyalty in the first place. He would also accuse me of cheating and get extremely possessive and jealous which I never did. I think he was projecting his insecurities I'm pretty sure he cheated on me with multiple people which btw idgaf about lol I'm just glad I got outta that situation. There have been multiple warrants for his arrest he has burned bridges with a lot of people. When my friends and family did background checks on him he convinced me he was an innocent victim of the American Justice system as a Cuban immigrant. I call bullshit on that one. He is a conartist from Havana who managed to get a green card and makes his living scamming families all over Florida. He lied to me about everything. I have so much tea to expose on this man. But tbh I just want to be safe and not let my anger cloud my better judgment. I recently logged in to my old airbnb account and have negative reviews from hosts because he would steal from their properties without me noticing. I accepted responsibility but it's tough knowing that I never did these things. I was raised differently. I was never in an abusive relationship before. I was raised in a loving household. I didn't know how to establish boundaries with this man because I never had to before. Thank God my family took me back home and forgave me. What do you guys think? Any feedback would be appreciated even constructive criticism. A domestic abuse hotline told me that I don't deserve to feel guilty because nobody gets into a relationship thinking their significant other will abuse them. I trusted the wrong person but I chose to end the abuse by walking away. ",2024-06-08 08:45:21,2025-03-17 03:26:21,violence
14yyfjo,Should I worry about possible future violence from boyfriend?,Dear_Strawberry163,20,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/14yyfjo/should_i_worry_about_possible_future_violence/,"EDIT: it's hard for me to react to everyone's comments individually, but I appreciate every one of you for taking time out of your day. Your responses have been very helpful.

Hi everyone, me (30 f) and my boyfriend (30) have been together for about a year. I'm seriously considering breaking up with him, since the relationship is emotionally abusive. He can be extremely sweet at times, but then switches and becomes cruel, condescending and aggressive (punching walls, shouting, throwing a blanket in my face) in the way he behaves and talks to me. During one of those instances, I slapped his arm after he said something particularly hurtful. It was about something that he knew was very sensitive. However, I don't think I was right to slap him and I apologized profusely. I'd never done something like that before, in any relationship. I was genuinely shocked by my own reaction. He put his face a few centimetres away from mine and told me that if I ever did that again, he would punch me in the face as hard as he could. That he would beat me down and that he didn't care that I'm a woman. I didn't really react to it as I was terrified.

Now I'm asking myself if I should be worried about a possible escalation of violence in the future, especially if/when I break up with him? Did I 'deserve' this reaction or was it not ok?",2023-07-13 22:23:39,2025-03-17 03:26:22,violence

We got together when I was 19 and a freshman in college.. The red flags were everywhere but he was my first serious relationship. I was homeschooled and never had any relationships prior because of how strict my mom was.. So I was oblivious to everything happening.. Started off with insulting me..and then “play fighting” which always ended up with him throwing me against walls..He then started forcing me to do sexual things with him and would threaten to break up with me if I didn’t..He was always talking to other girls during this time, and me not having any support from anyone, I didn’t want to lose him and gave in to everything he wanted.. When I moved out (got kicked out due to going to a concert with him overnight without an adult..told you my mom was strict).. The abuse got worse. He was now choking me, throwing me hard against walls, throwing me down on the ground and yelling in my face..Hitting me…And then…he raped me.. His family and mom knew because they witnessed it, but the mom was the leader of the pack and didn’t want her son going to jail…She threatened me instead that she would have police come for me..that she had good lawyers that would take me down…

After 3 years of the abuse, I finally got strong.. got accepted to a good university near me, made friends, and enjoyed life..He and his family didn’t like that..But I didn’t care.. I was mean, but had to be and broke up with him..which led to a month of him threatening to kill himself, storm my place and destroy my stuff..but I blocked him and moved on..

Issue is…The nightmares..the flashbacks..the triggers… Im trying to find a therapist to help but they’re all expensive and don’t take my insurance.. I want to report him but because I waited so long, I can’t… He lied to a family friend of mine, and turned him against me.. My ex is now with a girl 10 years younger than him, and I’m worried all the time about what he’s going to do to her and if she’s safe…

His family still follows me on Facebook..especially the one that doesn’t know anything about what happened.. and I just wanted to tell them everything..


How do I get past this?? Past the memories and pain.. I’m in a safe and loving marriage now, expecting our first..Life is good.. But the memories and nightmares are just becoming worse and too much.. ",2024-04-27 19:29:01,2025-03-17 03:26:26,violence

I regularly see one of our neighbors in the morning when I’m leaving for uni but other than that we don’t have any contact with them.

They had another fight yesterday and this morning his face was pretty messed up.

The police will not tell the person that you have enquired about this or notify them that their domestic violence history has been disclosed to you.

Edit to add: you can also request the information if you're concerned about a loved one

Second edit: Someone kindly shared their story about having their reputation ruined by an ex who has erased his criminal record of the domestic violence. Please be aware that while police reports about previous DV incidents are helpful to know about, not finding any evidence of prior violence shouldn't serve as an automatic reassurance that a person is harmless or honest.

1ddjlz2,Escaping Domestic Violence Without Resources,ThrowULPT_DV,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ddjlz2/escaping_domestic_violence_without_resources/,"*Note: This post was written for the* r/UnethicalLifeProTips *sub, for reasons which I feel become clear from the contents, but I have currently been unable to post there due to automod and she's desperate for any help. Thank you for reading*

ULPT Members, I come to you today with a simple request: Help my friend escape her abusive home situation without reporting her abuser.

Context: I have a very dear friend, 38F, who for the sake of this post we'll call Jenny. Jenny has had an extremely difficult life. Her biological family was various shades of neglectful and abusing, and at age 10 when she did what she was supposed to do (reach out to the adults responsible for her and ask for help) due to SA at home, she was removed from the home and placed in the foster care system where the abuse only worsened. All of this to give context that

* Jenny is deeply untrusting of CPS and authorities in general
* Jenny has been conditioned to believe that the terrible things done to her are her fault, and that talking makes it worse
* Jenny has for much of her life attracted abusers who sense her vulnerability and prey on it.

Now, at 38, Jenny is a mother of 2 small children and is entirely dependent upon their abusive father. This man (we'll call him POS) has abused her financially, emotionally, mentally, physically and sexually for the majority of their relationship. Jenny has finally reached her breaking point and has ended her relationship with this man, but as we all know, physically leaving an abusive asshole is another kettle of fish entirely. The abuse has ramped up since she stood up to him, and I have absolutely no doubts that if she's still in POS's house in 3 months, she'll soon be in the ground, either because he put there or because he drove her to do it herself.

Jenny has no education and no financial resources. She has work experience and has worked entry level jobs (mostly fast food) but is currently unemployed. She has no safety net to speak of. She desperately wants to escape, but is utterly unwilling to report POS, for the dual reason that she is reliant on his income to care for her children (he can't go to jail, he has to go to work) and that she has a massive, trauma fueled fear that CPS will take her babies away and they'll live through the same horrors that she experienced.

Our current plan is to have her, during her next WIC visit, speak to their access person and claim that her boyfriend no longer wants to be with her and is kicking her out in order to try and secure a fast track to emergency government housing, but I simply worry this won't be enough with her unwilling to discuss her abuse. After all, there's a ton of competition for these resources.

Aside from the obvious (introducing POS to a tire iron), ULPT community, I need you to go out of character for a minute and do the most ethical thing at all, help this wonderful woman escape an abusive home. Sex work is off the table (it was discussed, she will not be an object again, even transactionally) but otherwise, any method of attaining short term housing, building resources that can't be taken away, and just starting to build a life for herself are welcome. All ideas will be considered. Life has shit on this beautiful soul every moment of her life, please help me lift her up to attain basic human dignity. Also, if anyone who DOES work in the DV/CPS/LE systems has any insight into what she CAN talk about with ZERO fear of a criminal case being opened, that would be huge insight as well. Thank you so much for your time and your help everyone.",2024-06-11 17:19:29,2025-03-17 03:26:30,violence

14qe5ly,Is joking about violence abuse?,AntoniaLouise123,12,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/14qe5ly/is_joking_about_violence_abuse/,"Currently I’m dealing with the separation of a man who was very manipulative. Now that it’s over I see a lot of things differently. However I still have trouble labelling a lot of the stuff he did to me. On a few occasions he said very scary things, now I ask myself whether this is abuse? 
Once he slapped me “as a joke” just out of the blue when he was drunk. I thought it was disrespectful but not necessarily abusive.
Another time he told me that he wanted to kidnap me and that he knew how to hide a body if he ever wanted to kill someone. 
He also described how he wanted to slit me open, let me bleed out and take my organs out of my body and when I said that I used to trust him and that these jokes scared me he laughed and said “your fault”.
On another occasion I trusted him with some of my very scary nightmares I suffer from in which I get tortured and murdered. He said that that thought kind off turned him on and when I answered that this was not okay at all, he called me the weird one for having these dreams in the first place. 
His “jokes” weren’t just about me, he also fantasised about dissecting a human being or joked about wanting to sleep with the eight year old sister of his friend. 
Honestly I don’t know where to place any of this. All of it was always just jokes and mostly out of the blue and nothing like - “if you cross me I’ll kill you” in an argument. 
So is this abuse or just someone who has very very very poor taste in jokes?",2023-07-04 12:40:49,2025-03-17 03:26:32,violence

NC and blocked. She had a lot of mental health issues it seemed, and was also an alcoholic. I'd broken up with her many times due to her bad actions and emotional abuse towards me, but was trying to allow her to show me she was working on changing (she'd promised many things, but always failed, sadly). I had told her it was the only way I'd consider coming back to the relationship was long term signs of real change (like no more lying, stop drinking, etc.).

One of the last times I saw her she was drunk in her apartment. She was angry I wouldn't sleep with her and wouldn't return to the relationship right then and there (mind you, I had told her many times I'd never sleep with her if she was drunk, and she had also promised she'd stop drinking as she'd usually become abusive).

During this time, she threw things all over her room, stormed around the apartment raising her voice, and slammed the door behind her. It was very tantrum like. The whole time I froze and calmly asked ""please stop?""

Being around her drunk had already scared me. But then her throwing around items in her house made me frightened too (nothing hit me).

**Is throwing things an early sign of further more physical abuse? Was I right to see these things as a major warning sign?**

For additional support, in the past she had told me her prior long term boyfriend sometimes had to restrain her as there would be some element of physical *something* between them, but I never got full on details... which made me think she would get physical with him (or vice versa).

With me, she had been drunk in the past in a *tantrum* like state and tried to kick at me (kind of like a child, but still made me uncomfortable, felt like *attack-ish*). One time she randomly bit me so hard on my shoulder it turned deep purple with a bruise. Would call me names, try to humiliate me, once spat in my home, etc.

During all of her outbursts, I always remained composed and tried to calm her down with kindness and support. I guess sometimes *freezing* but trying to remain collected - no yelling on my end, or anything. A few times she asked why I would never yell at her, never call her names or anything, she asked how I was always in control... She even said she wished I'd lose it on her; but I never would.

It almost felt like she wanted me to blow up. She did once tell me that during her ""drunken outburst"" she ""wanted to see how far she could push me"" - which made me feel even more that a lot of this behavior was on purpose.

Again, I have since left the relationship as of a month and a half ago, but a lot still haunts me.",2023-02-21 01:44:32,2025-03-17 03:26:33,violence
1bmxmvw,Subtle threats of violence,Round_Let7773,6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1bmxmvw/subtle_threats_of_violence/,"I just need to vent even if its into a void.

About half a year ago my boyfriend assaulted me sexually and physically. He was also very abusive for months on end emotionally. He even threatened to kill my family in graphic detail. Since then, I have had bad PTSD and have had a drinking problem. I know that I should have left. My family situation is complicated and I am financially dependent on him, so I have many excuses as to why I am still living with him.
Anyways, he has been kind and sweet to me usually. I have been working on staying sober. However, sometimes I slip up and drink to forget that trauma. When this happens , we always fight. Last night I told him that I hated him and threw a shoe at him. I feel horrible and I know this is abusive of me. I apologized but he demanded I leave our apartment. I have no where to go or to stay, and I also was in no condition to leave. So I said no.
He then said “you know what happened last time when you didnt leave,”.
Referencing a time when he pointed a gun at me in his car when I was crying and begging him to let me stay. 

He apologized and said it was because he just wanted me to leave and he thought “I knew he didnt have a gun anymore.” 

This apology seems like bullshit. I know I shouldn’t have drank and me escalating the situation was wrong and abusive. But I just feel like him implying that threat and mentioning the trauma that even started my drinking in the first place is evil. He is mad that I am so hurt even though I initiated the fight. To me, this confirms my anxiety that I am not safe and that he hasnt changed. Am I crazy? :(

I’ll try to keep this as concise as I can.
My mom and sister got away from my dad around this time last year. My dad is a narcissist who had kept us all in a bubble for over 20 years. My mom finally got the courage and willpower to leave. She told him she was leaving, he agreed to pay her 500$ every paycheck. I was there when this happened.
My mom has been disabled for over 20 years and unable to get a regular job. She was a stay at home mom while my dad worked and supported the family with a long distance job. She tried numerous times to start her own businesses but he always shut it down. 
My mom took my sister, who has an intellectual disability, with her. My dad was abusive to us kids as well and there was no chance of her staying or even wanting to stay. I didn’t have the capacity to take them in, and they fled to another state to family, basically homeless. They packed up only what they could fit in the car and left. A year later, my mom and sister are living in a camper that is falling apart. My dad refuses to send any money.
He finally sent the divorce papers and he’s demanding alimony, money in times of hardship (ha. Ha.) he accused her of cheating, and he’s demanding profits from any business she starts in the future.
My mom and sister have nothing. I am sick to my stomach. Is there anything I can do or advise my mom to do? My dad lives in a completely paid off house that has its own water supply. He hardly has any bills and doesn’t have any pets. There is no question that he is a disgusting monster. I won’t detail everything he’s done over the years, but this is his way of punishing her for leaving. She doesn’t have the money for a lawyer.

1bauanp,His destruction of property and eventual violence towards people,Alinda_,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1bauanp/his_destruction_of_property_and_eventual_violence/,"Was thinking about this lately after a recent incident with my ex. Let me preface this by saying I’m already in no-contact with him and I fortunately was never physically abused by him.

I wanted to list out the things he’s attacked or destroyed during our relationship and after (that I know about):

- Punched a U-Haul truck door after getting frustrated with the company
- Punched his steering wheel and violently made a U-turn when we got into an argument that almost led to a breakup (about him calling me selfish for me wanting to lose a mere 15 lbs because I would lose my curves, which he tried to gaslight me about.) To be fair, I initiated the argument because I was so bothered about it, and we were on our way to celebrate Christmas with his family, so it was pretty stressful. Doesn’t excuse his actions though.
- Destroyed and had to replace an expensive drill that he used for work because he was frustrated at something work-related. He works in a field where people have a toxic masculinity mindset, and some of his coworkers also seem to have destructive behavior. Ex blamed it on testosterone despite the fact that many people with high T can control their behaviors.
- Pulled off and dented a closet door that kept getting stuck at our apartment
- Pulled out and broke our kitchen sink hose, which would potentially cost us hundreds if the maintenance people weren’t able to fix it or if there was water damage (fortunately it was fine)
- Pulled off the top “shelf” of the blinders for our sliding door. Not sure what it’s called, but he was frustrated about it after he broke the sink hose. (Btw, I was honest to the maintenance people about how all the things broke because they asked. They seemed concerned for me after I did.)
- Destroyed a tissue box during one of our arguments. Probably the most minor thing he’s destroyed tbh.
- Totaled his first car because he was upset that my friend (who he hates because she tipped me off to the fact that he was abusive, and who he claimed was a “witch whispering into my ear”) said that he didn’t look like somebody who went to the gym. Yup, that was it. From what I understood, he was on a merging lane, and instead of letting the other car merge, he tried to speed past them, causing the accident. He blamed the other driver and let everyone else believe so, even though he was 100% at fault. He said he was fuming about me telling him what my friend had said and that was the reason he had such a “fuck you” attitude that day.
- Got into another accident with his second car because he was aggressively tailgating. Other driver also had road rage and ended up purposely(?) bumping into his car, causing it to make a 180 spin. Not entirely his fault, but it’s so easy to just not tailgate.
- Attacked the beams at his dad’s house with a hammer because he was going manic. He recently got fired and was frustrated about his life and our breakup. (I was still talking to him because I hoped we could be friends and that he needed support during rough times.) He made a nonchalant comment about how our dog looked so terrified after the event. She used to go to me for comfort when he yelled. He loves her and I hope she’ll be fine, but I feel like a terrible person for leaving her with him and would never forgive myself if something happened to her. She’s probably the only thing my ex loves right now.
- And probably the worst offense - he attacked his dad to the point where his dad needed to visit a hospital. He wasn’t completely battered and was just “roughed up”, but I think he dislocated something in his shoulder/clavicle area? Ex was angry that his dad left the door open and the dog ran off (because she was scared of him yelling). She came back home after 5+ hours. His dad protected him by telling the hospital he got into a minor car accident. When I asked my ex if they called the cops out of shock of what he did, his response was, “No. Why? Are you going to?”

When my friends and family were concerned about me because of his violence, I always told them his physical aggression was never directed towards people. Everyone says destruction towards objects often leads to violence towards people, and it was true in his case. He said he would never attack me, but he has promised and lied about so much of his behavior that I have zero reason to believe that.

When I expressed my and my family’s concern, instead of being understanding, his response was something like, “school shooters are the kids treated like they were going to become one.” It sounded like a threat.

And of course, instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he blames me and everyone else for “what he’s become”. No, dude, you’re just an angry, abusive asshole and it’s all on you. Plain and simple.",2024-03-09 22:35:47,2025-03-17 03:26:47,violence
1ay6wmq,Support about domestic violence,Traditional-Many-827,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ay6wmq/support_about_domestic_violence/,"Hello everyone, I’m from denver Colorado my name is Sarah, I just wanted to get other people’s input about a situation that I’m going through at the moment. 
About six months ago my 7 yr old daughter’s dad went to jail for domestic violence against me. My daughter was exposed to the violence from him. I called the cops on him. He went to jail. 
Anyways, my point I’m getting to is that a CPS case was opened against him and me. It was open because he exposed our daughter to violence. I tried doing the right thing by calling the cops trying to protect my daughter. Anyhow, now CPS is wanting me to take domestic violence treatment, even though I’m the victim in the case and never caught a charge. I feel like it’s unfair and that I should not have to because I did protect my daughter from the violence by calling the cops. They told me that I should’ve known better because this has happened in the past once before. I told them I had faith in him and wanted him to be in our daughters life and that’s why I gave him a second chance and that I did not choose to be in a domestic abuse relationship. My attorney has not spoken up for me at all, now they want me to do treatment for DV, therapy, and all kinds of other things. 
To top it off he is out of jail now, under the influence of meth. CPS has not set up any treatment plan for him. And they are still allowing two visits per week with her dad supervised and I feel like it should not be allowed until he follows through with treatment and make some progress. 
Is this right or am I crazy? 

Please no judgemental comments. Just wanting advice. Thank you.

My live-in-partner has been jobless for years, and all he does all day is play online games on his desktop computer (that I bought), and he barely helps out with the house chores.

He would call me and the kids (his own kids) stupid. He would curse at us. He would threaten to hurt me physically. He would hurt me psychologically in front of my kids.

I don't want to look sorry, so I often stand my ground. I would show him I am not scared of him. He doesn't like that.

I am already exhausted from working alone to provide for my family. I earn a lot, but in exchange, I have to work the night shift, and for more than three years now.

Lately, I haven't been able to sleep well, and it's already affecting my health. I can feel it.

Then just today, he physically hurt me, pulled my hair hard. Right in front of my kids. All this because I confronted him that he should stop stressing the kids out.

He plays this MIR4 almost 24/7 and he would force my kids to pilot his account that it has been interfering with their school work.

I made the wrong move to a narcissist. They hate being confronted and they hate it even more when the other party is right.

I am losing my sanity slowly. I would often think of different scenarios on how I would end my life. Somehow it makes me feel relaxed, just thinking that everything will be over the moment I do it.

All the pain, all the sufferings. I would no longer feel stressed about the future. I would no longer feel scared.

I know I need to leave, but somehow, I am just exhausted and scared to face the world alone. I don't know what else to do.",2023-07-01 14:09:20,2025-03-17 03:26:53,violence
ra6dpv,"I left a year ago, today. My Domestic Violence story",Murky-Breadfruit-883,93,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/ra6dpv/i_left_a_year_ago_today_my_domestic_violence_story/,"A year ago today, I left my abusive ex. He covertly abused me for a long time. I had a digital Trail of me reaching out to his family, since 2014. Asking them to help me with his abusive Behavior. I went on a domestic violence leave of absence, at two different jobs, within two years. I had wanted to leave for a long time, but I had nowhere to go. When I was pregnant with our son, my ex's mother asked me if my ex had ever hit me. However, he didn't become physically abusive, until after our son was born. Seems she didn't care after our son was born, because when I called her, and texted her about the abuse she ignored me. He would shove, grab, hold me down, and tossed me across the room.
 He shoved me into two coffee tables, and a coat rack. In 2018, he pulled me by my hair while I was sitting on the floor, and our two-year-old son was in my lap. On the weekend of July 4th, 2020 he even abused me under his family's nose, at a lake house, in Wisconsin. After drinking the whole day, and his family sleeping, he said he was going to take our child out for a drive, to help lull him to sleep. Even though he was intoxicated. I put my hands up to tell him no, and he pushed me into his grandparent's coffee table, after shoving me, I walked to the basement where his family all slept to get away from him. Surrounded by his sleeping family members on couches, and cots, he hurled several couch pillows at my face very hard. He then proceeded to rip apart my gym bag until it was in pieces. Many nights he kicked me out of the house, and put a chair in front of the door. I either had to call my mom to have her pick me up, or wait for him to change his mind. He threatened to kick me out, if I didn't have sex with him. He said he expected a significant other, and not a roommate. When he tried to initiate sex, I cried, and told him I didn't want him to touch me. He yanked me off of the bed, and proceeded to get a baseball bat and beat the bedroom furniture with it, all the while screaming at the top of his lungs. He blocked the doors, and prevented me from leaving the house. He called me horrific names. He called me a ""nasty cunt"" on my 34th birthday, while he held our child in his arms. He told me, "" I jerk off to women who are uglier than you, online"" He threatened to kill himself more times than I can count. He drunkenly waved two large kitchen knives around the living room talking about suicide on this day. He would leave pornographic websites on his phone, and leave it lying around the house, for our son to come across it trying to play games on his phone. He did all of this in front of our child!
On October, 26th, 2020 three days after my son's 4th birthday. My ex had shoved me into our coat rack, and it fell on top of me. This is when I decided to come back to Jesus, I became a born-again Christian when I was 18 years old, after fleeing my mom's ex-husband, who gave me a black eye. I moved in with my aunt and uncle, who are Christians, and I didn't quite understand it. I just thought it was another religion. I bowed my head down, and asked Jesus into my heart, truly believing he was real. It was then, that I felt changed. However, I hadn't been walking with God for a long time at this point. I knew he was my only way out, I ran to my Bible, and I cried and prayed. The Lord led me to apply for a DV residency program again, I was denied residency for the program, in 2019.
On this day, my ex committed an act of domestic violence harassment. To which he was later charged and arrested, last year, Christmas Day. We looked like a happy family on Instagram, and among some of our friends. At this time I was so sad, and broken, that I was in denial. I was conditioned for so long to think it was my fault, and that I deserve to be treated this way. I actually thought that I deserved to be treated this way.
It wasn't until my ex, drove drunk with our child on this day, last year,
That I finally realized my power.
Being a great mom, is the only thing I really know how to be. Endangering my baby boy, is all it took for me to leave.
With the amazing help, and that extra push from my brother, who was, and is still my rock. My brother received a call from me about 2 a.m, and I told him how much my ex has been drinking, and after listening to this advice, I called the police. When my ex had returned he confessed to driving drunk with our son.
I caught that on an audio recording.
My brother picked me up, my ex didn't allow me to take our son with me. I stayed the night at my mother's house, and my small family helped me devise a safety plan to leave. My ex was off work for an extra day and wouldn't let me have my son. He went to work 3rd shift on  Thursday, December, 10 2020.
I took my son to my mom's house.
I drove back to my ex's apartment and packed several bags of toys, my stuff.
Toothbrushes, toothpaste, vitamins and blankets.
Early the next morning I texted my ex,
""I want you to know that as a friend, I will always love you. I want you to get help.""
The very next morning 7am, my brother watched my son, and I took my audio recordings, and went and filed for a civil restraining order, afterwards, I went to the bank, and removed my name from our Joint bank account. Keeping my private checking account I had, with about $900.00 to last me.
I had nowhere to go, and I hadn't recieved word if I had been accepted into the DV program, yet.
My mom cleans houses for a living and I was friend's with one of her clients.
Her client had a large, and nice basement apartment she offered for my son and I to stay with her, without hesistsion. She's an amazing women. My son and I owe her son much. She let us stay there from December, 12-January 11th.
While we were living there, I had to go back to court for a civil protection orders hearing. On December, 23rd. TESSA, a local domestic violence program helped me obtain a free protection order attorney. I was able to keep my civil protection order for 6 more months, but was expected to co-parent with my ex. My ex got my son back for one day on December, 23rd-24th. My protection order attorney informed me that one of my exhibits on my phone was a crime, and there was enough evidence for a domestic violence harrasment charge, and that I should report it to the police right away.
I did so, on Christmas morning when I had my son back with me. Later, Chrsitmas evening, my ex was arrested. He spent an entire weekend in jail.
I was present over the phone for his trial, on Monday morning.
He had to pay $1000.00 for his crime and could not contact me, whatsoever.
He told the judge he had a civil court agreement to see his son. The judge asked me if I was comfortable with this agreement. I told the judge, not right now. He's been abusing me for years. Judge said, okay,
 That's that, no contact order it is.
 A Mandatory Protection order was put in place.
With 2 protection orders and a temporary place to live, I spent the next month budgeting my money, having my son sign onto remote pre-school classes. I took time to implement schoolwork with him. We went sledding down the neighbor's yard. We played board games, and watched movies. I spent weeks researching how to get a probono child custody attorney. As I knew it wouldn't be long before I was served custody papers. I spent nights with my laptop, listening to hours of abusive recordings. Sifting through them to see what would be most useful for custody court. I cried really hard afterwards. It took a toll on me.
I met with my son's pediatrician and told her what had happened. Giving her evidence to show her. I had to make child abuse claims through CPS with what I had. (Drunk driving, and hair pulling incident)
I researched how to best use my audio recordings for court, and I found a transcription company in Denver, they took my relevant audio recordings, and had them transcribed for court. They included my ex texting me saying that he called me 50 times, I must need therapy. And a court certified transcribe audio recording, of him admitting to drinking and driving with our son.
I prayed that I would receive an email from the DV program, telling me I was accepted. After strenuous research and uploading evidence. I was accepted by a local program called, ""The Justice Center."" I was approved for an attorney, however, it could take up to 6 weeks to find one.
We moved our stuff into the DV program on Monday January, 11th 2021.
I walked into a fully furnished apartment.
Modern (matching)  furniture. A flat-screen, smart TV, a colorful bathroom, and two beds.
I walked into my very first ever apartment, without my ex. I knew then, that my son and I were going to be safe. I cried so hard, but they were happy tears. I couldn't remember the last time I cried out of happiness. I didn't have to worry about what I was wearing, what I was talking about, whether or not I would say something the wrong way, or try to stick up for myself. Finally, I was safe, and I could rest. Both my son, and I experienced weeks of nightmares, and hyperarousal. I had dreams of a man, family member, that was not my ex, but he was trying to kill me and my son. My son, had dreams of daddy killing himself in the head with a knife, I was able to audio record it, and use that for court as well. After the dreams seemed to dissipate after a couple weeks, I got myself into counseling, but could not yet get my son into play therapy as we were currently beginning our custody dispute. I was served with child custody papers, and my ex, and his attorney, and my ex's wealthy, and enabling family issued an emergency motion for temporary orders hearing. He claimed I was an emergency, and I had no place to live, and that my son was not being taken care of. He lied on his child Custody petition lying about why he was arrested, among everything else. Before I even had an attorney, I was already prepared. Without an attorney, and by myself, I issued a response to his petition, as well as filing several exhibits with my response. I had a note from my son's pediatrician, stating that I told her about the abuse since 2018, and she stated that she's never even met my ex. Who is the father of our child. I filed the confession of drunk driving, and transcription form, and that was merely a taste of what I had. I had, and still have 40 to 50 audio recordings of abuse. My ex and his family. I know that they spent thousands, and thousands of dollars. I had so much evidence that I did not spend a dime. Our custody case was approved a court-ordered child, and family investigator. Her report reflected all of my claims, and evidence. When we came out of custody court, eight months later, I I was able to obtain the one thing I wanted, sole legal decision-making. I was able to take steps through our stipulated parenting plan, to ensure that my child would be safe. The child and family investigator called me and told me that it was women like me who are the reason that she does what she does. She told me that I did absolutely everything right as a good mother protecting her child.
I wanted to leave since 2019, I fell for the crocodile tears, the promises to change, and get help, the pleas for another chance. I never would have allowed a man to treat me this way, because I grew up getting beaten by a grown man as a teenager, and watching my mom get beat, too. Abuse is slow, it is subtle, it is Progressive. You don't even know what's happening, until it gets so bad. It starts off with a little bit of control here, and there. Abusers will test you, to see what you will tolerate, and the more you tolerate, the worse the abuse gets. Lundy Bancroft has saved my life, I'm all over those red flags now. I am setting great examples for my son. I'm in college, I can stay at My residency for another four years, and I'm going to continue being the best mom that I am.

I believe he feels threatened I can send him away from home since now, sadly from an inheritance also of a rental place, I'm in a position to pay rent/bills/expenses both for me and my daughter, and for my pregnancy.

I was angry because it's been a year since my mother passed away from suicide and she was heavily abusive, it triggers me to come back to her birth home where my grandparents live. 

I saved some photos when I went there after the funeral a year ago, I was living with my in-laws and been asking to have those photos back for a year now... I have reasons to think they lost them for good. 

Again I was angry because next week it's the first anniversary and those are all the photos I have left and may now be gone. I told him I wouldn't want his family at my house (they can see my daughter whenever, but never come visit my city which is 30mins top from theirs) and maybe not even him. If he's not emotionally abusive, he literally hits me.

So completely unpredictably as I wasn't yelling or anything, he started hitting me and pushing me. 

Told me 'now that I have money I think I'm something, but I was crying before' don't know how to translate this, he refers to how I struggled with being poor and/or as far as I could from my mother, because she as well (but far worse) hit me from when I was a toddler.

I feel numb. I'm going with him at the gyno to know our baby's gender next Wednesday. 

My father is happy because he thinks I'm in a good place, he's 78.

I guess I just want someone else to tell me they’ve also experienced this, so I don’t feel like I’m permanently damaged. 

My ex would get randomly violent for the smallest things when we’d be having discussions. One moment we’d be talking calmly, and the next I would say something he didn’t like, his face would darken, and he’d attack me. He’d hit me or shove me or do something else that would be obviously really painful. 

And often, right afterwards, we’d go straight into having sex. He never forced me. I would somehow just find myself really aroused right after he attacked me, and I often found those sexual encounters really gratifying. 

That’s already fucked up, but since I finally made myself leave, I’ve been missing those sexual encounters after the attacks so much it feels like an addiction. 

In my sexual encounters since, I’ve been really turned on by rough sex and pain during sex. I guess it reminds me of how sex with him felt, when I’d still be terrified and shocked and in pain from wherever he hit me, and somehow that sex was better and more intense. 

The other day, this guy I’ve been casually seeing was in my house, and he walked into the room right as I was leaving it. We didn’t see each other, and he knocked right into me and I fell pretty hard against the doorknob. It knocked the wind out of me and hurt like hell. 

But as he was apologising and asking me if I was okay, I recovered from the shock of falling and suddenly I was so turned on and I just wanted to jump him. 

It’s like this horrible pathway has been forced open in my brain and I can’t close it. And now a part of me wants to ask him if he would hit me because I keep wondering if that will make sex afterwards feel like what I’m craving with my ex. 

I won’t, obviously, because I don’t want him to think I’m even more fucked up than he’s likely already seen, but I’m just so frustrated by all of this and it feels really shameful and terrible and I don’t know what’s wrong with me.",2023-06-02 22:39:03,2025-03-17 03:27:03,violence
1i647ha,I can’t afford to leave ,Itchy_Disk_6667,181,111,https://v.redd.it/vrbun7wte8ee1,"Hi Reddit, I’m a 24 year old female and my boyfriend is a 36 year old male. I met my boyfriend about four years ago. When we first met I was driven and a hard worker. I was working two jobs, 16 hours a week. He admired that about me. Eventually he started to complain about how little time we were spending together. He eventually asked me to move in with him after five months of dating so I wouldn’t have to two jobs. I was ecstatic and because at that point I was already falling in love with him. Since then every job I get he somehow throws a tantrum, shows up at my work, calls my work until I eventually quit. I would be at work and he would call and complain about how sick he is, how horrible of a girlfriend I am for not taking care of him.Threatening kicking me out by the time I get home. The past 4 years I’ve had over 5 different jobs. I can talk for days about all the stuff we’ve been through. I’m writing this because I want to leave. I’ve left a couple times before, but always came back. This time I’m done. I’m at a position where I can’t get up and go. I have no money, no car, no savings. About 2 weeks ago he was at the mall with his dad getting a new phone, I purposefully walked away because I knew he would try to make me join his plan. He called me and made a stupid excuse, in front of everyone he made it sound reasonable that we should be on the same plan. Not wanting to be an asshole I agreed. I don’t even have control over my phone plan. 

He’s abusive. He hits me and leaves me with bruises. He kicks me while I’m weak on the ground. He spits in my face. He dumps water over my head to degrade me even more. If I don’t want to have sex, he forces himself on me. One time he even spit in my face after he was done violating me. 
If he’s mad at me while we’re driving he’ll continuously slap and punch me. He hit me so hard in the car one time my earring broke and I almost crash. He smacks me so hard in my face that my ears ring. He verbally abuses me. 

I’ve been looking for another job and I’m not having any luck. Can anyone give any advice?
I can’t go to family because it’s embarrassing. They’ve witnessed me leave and go back. I won’t put them through that again. 

Has anyone been in this kind of situation? How did you leave?",2025-01-20 23:16:55,2025-03-17 03:27:05,violence

*Edit: The reason I’ve stayed is because we broke up for 1 month a little over 2 months ago and didn’t talk at all during that month. However, he ended up reaching back out to say that he didn’t realize how in love with me he was and how he wanted to commit to being a good boyfriend to me and how he didn’t realize how good he had it blah blah blah and so we reconnected and then it went right back to the hot and cold/wishy washy stuff and now he says, “I said I loved you, not that I was IN love with you,” even though he 100% had said he was IN love with me on the phone call when he reached back out.*

I posted this in another forum and was told I should check this one out as well so I’m posting here too to get opinions. I don’t think he is being abusive, but rather straightforward and honest. I would also love to have the opinions of males so I can see it from their perspective.

My bf (M34) and I (F23) had a conversation tonight and I just feel empty with this deep, deep sadness inside. I need people to wake me up with their interpretation of it and their advice because I feel like I’m so blinded by my love for this man that I’m not seeing the damage I’ll do to myself long-term. 

Here is the conversation:

Me: Do you want me here? 

Him: I don’t want to end things. It won’t be me that puts an end to this.

Me: So do you want me here?

Him: I don’t care. You’re not going anywhere. You haven’t for a year.

Me: What is the point of having me here then?

Him: I feel like I didn’t choose you. I feel like I’m stuck with you. 

Me: Would you want your daughter to stay with someone like that?

Him: I think there is a pretty obvious answer to that. No. And if she wants to be dumb, then she better be strong. 

Me: Why would you want to be with someone you don’t love?

Him: Once you understand that men don’t get to marry the woman he falls in love with, but the woman that stays, then you’ll understand. We don’t get to marry the woman we love. 

Me: Why don’t you love me?

Him: There isn’t anything wrong with you. We just aren’t compatible. The things I find disrespectful, you are just completely oblivious to and don’t give a fuck. And the things you find most important, I think are stupid. 

Me: Do you think I could make you happy?

Him: I don’t think I’LL be able to make you happy. I don’t care if you make me happy because happiness isn’t that important to me. And I take back the last thing that I said about me not being *able* to make you happy. I don’t think I’ll ever make you happy because I don’t care about making you happy.",2023-09-09 19:36:38,2025-03-17 03:27:21,help

I have been dating my ex for a year and he’s been violent with me multiple times about 6 of 7 times now he’s hit me in the face or anywhere on my body while we were arguing. After the last post I made I decided to let him back into my life and about 3 weeks later it happened again…. We got into an argument because he wouldn’t leave my apartment after making rude remarks towards me after drinking. He’s been off and on staying with me since I couldn’t make up my mind on whether or not I wanted to be with him after the last time he hit me. It was pretty recent so I’ve been distance with him and my energy was different. I tried to break up with him tonight and make him pack his stuff but he refused to leave so I cried and begged him for over an hour. I ended up throwing some legos at my couch where he was sitting then he threw another set and hit me right in the face slamming me on the floor sitting me again putting my arms behind my back with all his weight on me so I’m screaming telling him to get off of me and that I couldn’t breathe. After I ran away I looked at myself in the mirror and noticed my bloody mouth and bruised forehead so I went into my room and pulled out my gun. It was unloaded so I pointed it at him telling him he needed to leave because I did not want him to attack me again. After he left I texted the police asking for assistance and they came and took pictures of my face. They arrested him while he was driving in the area but I just want to know if I’m in the wrong here.

1izqb6f,Am I being abused? Need help.,Much_Education83,8,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1izqb6f/am_i_being_abused_need_help/,"Hi there. I (M36) am concerned my partner (F35) is verbally and mentally abusive, but I keep going back and forth on it. I just need a way to find out for sure. FWIW, my long-term therapist says I am certainly being abused, but I don't really have any friends, so he is the only person I've ever discussed this with. I go back and forth on this, but I’d really like to hear from others who’ve been through something similar. Am I overreacting? Or is this as serious as it feels? I guess I'll give some anecdotes below and see what you think? These incidents are only a small sample—this has been a pattern for years, not just a handful of bad moments.

We've been together for 13 years and have known each other for 6 years before that. It was my first relationship, her second. Of course, everything started well. Honestly, the first 4 years or so were good/okay. Around year 6, in response to her volatile temper and our lack of a sex life (that she blamed on me, though this wasn't the case) I tried to end the relationship, asking for a break. After the 2 week break she cried a lot and we got back together.

We briefly did couples therapy after this and things were good for quite a while. Over the last 4 years or so things have gotten really bad. 

The most pervasive thing is her anger and opinion of me. She gets mad at me about anything and everything; chewing too loud, the loudness of my shoes on wood floors, being too slow to get out of her way when she walks around, etc. These small things have added up over time and I felt beat down, so I started trying to do things that I found fun, outside of time with her. She didn't like this. For example, I started running D&D games at a game store (1 day every 2 weeks), took a weekend German class (once a week), attending Comic-Con (she isn't interested in going) and eventually started a small business turning my passion into an income. She has not been supportive of any of these things, often telling me how selfish I am to do them. She makes endless small comments about how selfish I am and how hurtful she finds it that I do these things. She's also had some wild ideas around them, such as saying I'm not actually going to D&D, instead I'm going to the house of one of my players who's gay to sleep with him. Wild things.

Finally, the most serious things. We get into terrible arguments sometimes that start out of absolute nowhere and become all encompassing. It usually starts with her getting mad about something small and then claiming that I'm doing these things on purpose, that I don't understand her, that she's only mad cause I'm doing these things, etc. She gets very mentally nimble during an argument, twisting my words and making me feel confused and unsure of reality*.* These arguments often end with her screaming at me and calling me names (coward, p\*\*\*y, f\*\*\*ing idiot, stupid, telling me to shut up, etc). The pattern is then that I go take space and then she gets mad about this, claiming I should just talk things through with her, etc.

I'll give one somewhat detailed incident, though, as I write this I feel like I'm not presenting my experience very well. A few weeks ago one morning we fooled around for a while and it ended poorly (she gets very uncomfortable with sex). This was fine and I tried to be supportive. She then got very mad wondering why I was doing this when she wasn't interested (this was not the case! She was interested until the second she was not). She then got angry that the wasted time was going to result in us missing an event we were trying to go to. I said ya, some time has gone by, but let's give it a go! (it was only 10am and the event was all day). This is when things devolved and turned to me being confused and her yelling and name calling. She then declared she was leaving, going to the event on her own. Confused, I asked why she was doing that, can't we talk? She told me to get in the car if I want to talk, she's not waiting. I told her that didn't feel safe given how angry she was. She then left.

I texted her shortly after telling her I was going to take space for the rest of the day and I'd reach back out tomorrow. I was feeling really uncomfortable, anxious and scared. She then texted and called me non-stop for about 2 hours. The texts were awful and mean, full of cussing and name calling and making it seem like I was in the wrong. She called me literally 36 times in a row. I kept texting her to please leave me alone, I will reach out when I'm ready. I told her she was scaring me. She didn't stop.

We've been on a knife's edge ever since this incident. Currently she's acting very kind because I told her next time she did something like that I'd leave her. However, she's made minimizing comments about the boundaries I've set too, like ""Oh, well I guess I can't say that anymore.""

Anyway, I hope any of this makes sense. I didn't realize until now how poorly I'm able to communicate these things. I feel lost. If anyone has been in a similar situation, how did you handle it? Does this actually sound abusive to you? She's not like this all the time. I don’t know what to do next, and I’d really appreciate any advice.",2025-02-27 20:58:44,2025-03-17 03:28:50,help

Something I may have missed is that one time whilst he was living with his mother, she had to call the cops on him because he started raging at her. She had asked him to clean up the wood shavings from her garage (he wanted to start a carpentry business, which I helped him to set up, bought the LLC etc.), and he refused because it would “just get messy again the next day”. She then had to leave the kitchen as it got too much for her and he started walking around her kitchen and literally spitting on everything, like counters etc. I told him from the other end of the phone to calm down.. 
He has also threatened to burn his father’s ranch down as he was selling it and wouldn’t be getting a share. Always complained how his family wouldn’t help him, being homeless and living in his car. He owes me $800 that I gave him to buy food and weed. Not sure if I mentioned that. 
Anyways, I’m just really looking for advice. He has since blocked me on everything and I feel like I have brain damage. I’m on antidepressants. Not doing very well. Can’t access therapy. Quite suicidal.

i just want to say how much this sub, and everyone here, has saved my life. i joined while i was still with my ex, and at that time i felt so confused about if he was abusive or if i was the abuser. anytime i tried to post, i would delete it because i was scared of the answer. now i’ve been out of that relationship for exactly 31 days and my life has completely changed. i’m still scared to give too many details but i just want to say thank you so much to everybody for being part of this community. i scroll through it every day to serve as a reminder of why i left, and i read every single post. literally every single one reminds me of him. isn’t it crazy how they all act/talk exactly the same??

for anyone out there who is thinking about leaving, or who isn’t sure what to do yet, or who doesn’t want to leave, just know that you are so much stronger and more capable than you know. it took me 7 years, and i really thought i would just deal with it forever because i was too scared to make a decision. but fuck that. we all deserve better! 

also, read Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft. it gets recommended 20x a day in this sub because it’s no joke. the first few chapters literally changed my brain chemistry

I feel like I'm in a nightmare. I hate him, I have no idea how I fell in love with such a cruel person. He seems so kind but he is emotionally a nightmare for me. 

I havent felt this ugly, worthless, and disgusting in years. And I was abused by someone else for 10 years. If he reqd this he would think that means ""you must've been lying then because I'm not abusive so therefor your ex wasn't.""

I cannot stand him. He makes me feel like the only way to be heard is by never speaking. The amount of times I have gone to bed crying because of him or contemplating suicide is sick. He would think this is because I'm just always crying and always suicidal. 

If I tell him my emotions he immediately tells me he can't tell me his. 

He defelcts EVERY single word I say. I am not exaggerating. If you combed through any text I've sent him about my emotions, he hasn't once responded directly. He will just talk about his. 

He truly has convinced me I am the problem, that is the only reason I kept staying. I have a history of forgiving people because I blow up, and I am so embarrassed of my reaction to their abuse, that I think I am insane and seek forgiveness. 

He tells me he can't say how he feels even though all he ever does is tell me how I don't do enough, make excuses, etc. I am disabled and have severe panic issues and I'm going through hell with what's happening in the US right now, and I am the only one making plans to leave or be safe, ones that he didn't even care for until I had to basically force him to care about my life and his. Im still working and going to college which is huge for me, especially in a time like this, and he says things like ""you wanted to quit school and work out of fear. You want to live in fear, I don't."" 

He makes me feel like a child, like he's a stern hard working father who looks down on his daughter for being weak. My disabilities had to be proven to him, even while he knows they're real he still thinks I'm making excuses. He judges me so harshly with his eyes and silence, I feel like I need to appease him for him to see me as equal. 

I blocked him today but he tried contacting me because he had a shitty conversation with his dad, I comforted and defended him as I always do even though he probably thinks I'm a bitch for getting angry at his dad. If he heard that hed say ""you're putting words in my mouth"" even though that's how he sees me. Angry, rude, etc. He's never stood up for me when I tell him about my family, he thinks I'm negative, exaggerating, and mean about everyone and everything 

I've been told the opposite by anyone who has genuinely known me. Even my ex who was very abusive thought I was the kindest most empathetic person he'd met, he told me I was the reason he learned to feel color and empathy. he abused me in other ways but God even he made me feel like I was appreciated more than this. This guy thinks any negative emotion is like Satan and that youre ungrateful and weird for feeling anything. He sees my passion and strong emotions for things in the world as me being angry, he sees me talking about the abuse I've endured as negativity and shitting on other people. I could literally spend weeks trying to figure things out for him to make sure he's safe and he still tells me ""I want to be with someone who does things mutually and cares about me. Someone kind and gentle.""

I am kind and gentle. He is bringing out the worst in me. I have never gotten this angry at anyone other than my narcissist brother and my dad. Genuinely he makes me want to hurt myself. He gets me to the point of screaming. He says I'm screaming even when I'm not, and then when I do that's his ticket to tell me I'm not what he wants. He would also think this is my fault, that I get to this point. I have severe PTSD and he pushes all of the buttons, what feels like on purpose. If he heard that, he would say that's just my trauma, not him. I feel like I am literally losing my mind. 

We got off the phone now because I told him I couldn't take this anymore as I always do. Because after 5 minutes of me explaining how he doesn't appreciate or see me and that it's unfair that he thinks I'm doing nothing, all he did was say the same thing he always says. ""I don't agree with what you just told me. And am I not allowed to feel how I feel? That's what you're telling me?"" And to me saying I couldn't do this anymore, he just said ""I don't want to be with you. We can be friends"" I broke down, I was already leaving. Every time I tell him I CANT DO THIS ANYMORE, HE then tells me ""I don't wanna be with you."" I screamed I can't take this anymore, I CANT I CANT JUST STOP I CANT. and I hung up, he was still talking the whole time I was saying that. I'm shaking. 

He sent me a text saying ""I think we should see other people. I want to be with someone kind and who wants to do things with me mutually like partners. But we can still be friends I'm here for you (:"" or something like that, I deleted it and he's blocked. 

I need to make sure he never has access to me and my heart again. I am already going through hell right now. I am already terrified for my life and everyone else's and I'm the only one who seems to care and he yet again just convinced me I'm the one not being a partner and that he's gonna see other people. I hate him. He makes me hate myself so much. Every time I really need him it's like he uses it as an opportunity to crush me and make me feel even more alone. How do I make sure I stop letting this happen? I am so bad at having boundaries, and I'm so alone in my life I'm stupid and take the bait whenever he gently comes back and says something nice. 

I'm going to have an aneurysm if I keep letting him speak to me. I need this to end. ",2025-03-11 03:44:13,2025-03-17 03:28:55,help

He doesn't want to make a normal life. He sometimes give me $300 so I can pay for my car insurance. He doesn't want to learn how to drive because he wants to have a chofer .. he always give me a HORRIBLE hard time if I want to do anything with him like just going out with him is a hustle that ended up in a fight. And I start having friends so if he doesn't want to hang out then I will try and hang out with my friends. For him to hang out means ""you can be at my room and we can watch a movie"" and I hate his room because is covered is food containers, weed cartridge and vape cartridge everywhere, his bed is dirty and everything is cover in dust. I just don't want to be in his room and watch a movie as a plan for the day. Like for god sake why is so hard to go out and eat an ice cream or have any other activity's without making threats or insults everybody? is just very upsetting because he always gave me shit about not wanting to spend time with him. I don't want to spend time with him because he is always sleeping/high or whatever so if he is not responding to my texts about ""hey let's hang out!"" at 2:30PM then I will ask to my friends if they want to hang out with me. And of course once is 8PM this dude decided to wake up and give me shit about ""why you don't want to spend time with me?

I said to him that the other day when I went with my friend to that mall he never complained and in fact we have a lot of fun! so after I mentioned my friend he decided to throw all this messages to me.

I can't smoke weed in a Georgia stay here and abandon your mom find a studio here and live there, if I move with you as soon I save money you and I are away from your mom"" of course I decided to just say yes a everything so I avoid a fight.

1j7sr9v,feeling lost and need help,pink-banana-boat,2,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j7sr9v/feeling_lost_and_need_help/,"I have been struggling in my marriage for years.  I think I know the next steps that I need to take, but I am scared to take them.  I don't know what to do next.  I am sorry, this is going to be really long.  I haven't really opened up about my situation to anyone, at least not the whole story.

My husband (46) and I (40) met in college when I was 22.  We dated and only a few months later I ended up pregnant with our first child.  If my current self could have talked to myself back then about waiting longer. (hindsight, right?).  When I was pregnant with our second I was invited to a birthday party for a good friend of mine (who happened to be a dude, and no, I was never interested in him as more than a friend, I firmly believe that opposite sexes can be platonic friends with each other), and my partner (we weren't married yet) forbid me from going to the birthday party to see a lot of my college friends.  When I insisted I was going to go anyway, because it is a free country and I will see my friends if I want to, he blocked the doorway so I couldn't leave.  When I tried to push past him, he hit me.  I hit him back and then he hit me again.  I should have walked away then.  But I didn't.  To this day, he insists that I am the one who raised my hand first.  It makes me feel crazy like I don't remember what actually happened that day.  

Over the years, my sexual libido has declined.  Things went from (pre-first baby) having sex at least once a day to (after first baby) a several times a week to (after second baby) twice a week.  None of this was every enough for him and he would complain and tell me that I was ignoring his needs and not doing enough.  We would set ""schedules"" that he agreed to, but I couldn't honestly hold to because it was just too much for me, so I was constantly not upholding my end of the bargain.  When I would try to point out that the frequency was too much, then I was told that I wasn't being considerate enough of his needs.  Fast forward - he graduated and we moved cross country.  I went through a big hormonal change and my libido completely disappeared, but I still tried to maintain once a week or once every other week in order to satisfy him.  At one point, he just decided to stop kissing me.  Up until that point, we would kiss romantically every day, before he left for work or when he would get home (or both).  He decided that since that daily kissing was not leading to daily sex that it was unnecessary and we weren't going to do that anymore.  If he couldn't get what he wanted, then I was not going to get what I wanted.  Our sexual/intimate/romantic relationship died from there on out.  Because we had young kids at home, it was very difficult for me to hold a job during the normal work week due to the high costs of childcare.  So I eventually started my own business and ran it completely online (NOT AN MLM).  

A year later, I quit my part-time retail job to focus on my business as it was proving to be quite successful.  Two years later I gave birth to my third child.  During all this time, I was consistently told that I didn't do enough for my husband romantically or sexually, I didn't keep our house clean enough, and the list went on.  When my work grew to be too overwhelming to accomplish what I needed to do ""during the workday"" I began to continue working on it during the evening and early night hours.  Mind you, I had young children and an infant home with me during the day, so I did NOT have a ton of ""free time"" as I was taking care of their needs.  My husband began to berate me for all the time that I put into my business that wasn't ""really a business"".  

One time.  We had friends coming to visit and after I had spent 24 hours cleaning our house from top to bottom, all I had left to do was clean up and organize my work desk.  He was in a mood and he threw everything off my work desk onto the floor - including my desktop computer.  I was in tears.  He trashed the living room and told me everything was my fault because I cared more about my business than about him, our family, or making things presentable for our guests.   I threw myself into my business even more to show him that I was doing something good for all of us.  I even took on help and was able to make the income I needed to justify paying for childcare out of my business paycheck to myself.  It was never good enough.

  
We moved again and shortly after the pandemic happened.  I went through a couple of years with a lot of health problems.  During this time, my husband had a complaint about one of our children and I stood up to him.  It resulted in my husband smashing all of my house plants on the floor of our kitchen and dining room.  Our kids witnessed the whole thing.  He felt bad and replaced the pots and some of the plants and had a long talk with the kids about how you can't behave the way they just saw.  He has not damaged anything since that day, but instead, when he is angry, he will follow me from room to room when I try to make space from him to avoid a blow up fight that could turn physical.  He will wake me up out of a dead sleep to tell me all the things I am not doing good enough.  

A couple of years ago, I took my kids back home to visit with family.  It was a nice long visit and I came back to my home refreshed and rejuvenated and ready to work on the cracks in my marriage.  We had very nice sex and things seemed to be going good.  Then one day shortly after, he explodes in anger because I used the credit card to put gas and food on it during the travel back home (I drove 2400 miles away).  I was then accused of using sex as a weapon.

I have honestly just reached a point where I am stressed out when he is home.  I am always on edge because I never know if it will be a good day or a bad day.  We haven't had sex in almost a year, in 2 years we have only had sex two times.  I cannot get to that point sexually with him.  I feel vulnerable and exposed.  With the lack of trust, I just can't keep doing it.  It used to be one week a month I was told how I didn't do enough, I wasn't intimate enough, I wasn't present enough, I didn't make enough money, etc, etc.

I slowed my business way down in order to have more time to spend with my family.  I have struggled picking up part-time jobs because not a single one is flexible with my kids' school schedules.  They all want you to work until 4pm or start at 4pm, which would leave my youngest kids home alone for 1-2 hours.  I just can't do it, and can't find childcare for such a short time on randomly scheduled days.  

My husband and I talked about the financial part and we agreed it would be good for me to go back to school and finish my degree.  So I did.  I will finally graduate this May.  The last two years have been the literal worst two years of my married life so far.  The berating for not being present enough, being told constantly that I am selfish for not spending more time with my kids or him.  The list goes on.  

Well, over the holidays, he was upset about how much money I spent between Halloween/Thanksgiving/Christmas, so he took away all the bankcards, credit card and debit card.  He accused me of running the credit card up (this balance was added to mutually).  When I tried to ask for a print out of all the transactions, he refused to print it out.  Told me that I didn't need to see it and neither did he.  So there was no way for me to confirm if/by how much I may have overspent.  I am not super financially savvy, but I am not a big-spender either.  I do my best to spend within my means and pay debt down.  He left me completely without access to money so I have been unable to pay my son's dental bill one day or my own medical copays for doctor visits. Or even put gas in the vehicles.

Thanks to contributions from my family, I went to visit my sister over the holidays and had a wonderful time.  When I came home, I had decided that I wanted to go for grad school and get a masters degree.  One of my professor's in my class this semester invited me to do an independent study project, it would be really helpful for me to show what I am capable of.  When I talked to my husband about these ideas and about my future goals - he was shocked.  Shocked in anger that is.  I was told that I was wasting his time, my kids time, and my parents time by pursuing those things.  That I am way too old to be starting any of that now and I need to just get a job and start making money and getting ready to retire.  That whomever I have been talking to about these ideas is giving me bad information and I shouldn't take anything they say seriously.  That I would be a fool to go down this path because it will take too long and I will ruin my children's lives while they are still home.  I have spent the last 18 years of my life supporting him, his education (early on), and all of his career goals/decisions, and this is what happens when I try to stretch my own wings to fly?

I want to divorce.  But my daughter is going to start her last year of high school this fall, and I just can't bring myself to go through a divorce and potentially ruin what she has been calling her ""golden year"" for the last few months.  She has all these big ideas and dreams of what she wants to do and accomplish her senior year.  If I divorce my husband now, I would move closer to family, which would pull her out of her school and away from her friends.  Or I would leave her here and not get to share her senior year with her.  Neither is acceptable to me.  Am I making the right choice here?  Or am I just over reacting?  Are all husbands this way?  Is he actually being abusive in some way or am I just exaggerating it in my own head?  What do I do from here?",2025-03-10 06:55:09,2025-03-17 03:28:59,help

He was however, an abusive alcoholic man. He had a big ego and anger issues. He was also cheating in ways I don't want to elaborate on. It was an extreme level of verbal and emotional abuse.

I am not a greedy person and his money was not the reason why I chose him or why i tolerated abuse.
He provided me with a really comfortable life (no emotional and mental comfort tho) and there was never a financial problem. I am a working woman too and can pay my own bills.
He however took it on himself to pay for all my expenses.

It confuses me a lot. A person who is doing so much for me but is also abusive. 
I loved him from the bottom of my heart and that is the only reason why i stayed. I tried my best to fix him but failed.
I left him a while ago because I could no longer tolerate the abuse. It was affecting my self-esteem and mental health and my trust on him was fu,ked.

Was i ungrateful that i chose to leave ? 
Was I expecting too much ?
Sometimes i feel guilty that i left a man who did so much for me.

A lot of women joke about how they would rather cry in a lambo than on a bus. However, for me both are equally just as bad.

Would you have left too if you were in my place ?

Despite this, I still am deeply in love with him, deeply connected to him, and share so many interests together (for example, we both love cats, the outdoors, have similar political views, share many of the same perspectives on very specific and obscure topics). We both have chronic health problems and can understand each other on a deep level, and he’s the first partner I’ve ever had who has accepted me and never left/abandoned despite my chronic pain and health issues. When things are good, they are REALLY good: he’s my best friend, he knows what I’m thinking, he “gets” me, lifts me up and supports me, encourages me, believes in me, motivates me, and we have laughed SO much and had such incredible times together…

…Yet when things are bad, they can also be REALLY bad…he has called me every name in the book, cussed at me, screamed at me, thrown things around me, threatened to dump dozens of times, given me the silent treatment, threatened to abandon me in unfamiliar places, demanded my attention constantly (getting mad if I don’t answer right away), and acted somewhat controlling in various ways. The abuse episodes, while not physical, could be pretty horrific at times and would leave me numb/dissociated or in tears (often I didn’t cry, because he would get angry at me for crying around him after having his verbal abuse episodes).

He learned these behaviors from his parents and has been in denial about it for our whole relationship, despite me begging him throughout the years to stop and to get help. During the last episode, he was throwing things around and yelling, and I felt genuinely scared. He has extreme anger/rage issues and takes them out on me sometimes which can be quite upsetting and frightening. It led to my cortisol levels going through the roof, having a nervous breakdown for weeks, needing to take a separation from him to seek mental health treatment (therapy 2-3x/week), and I almost dropped out of my graduate program.

We have been on a hiatus for the past ~2 months and have talked about breaking up. I told him I needed a break after having a nervous breakdown, and we broke up for a short period but then started talking again. He said he would do anything to not lose me, that I’m the love of his life, and promised he would do everything I asked to change…but I’m upset he didn’t do this years before. After he proposed to me almost 2 years ago, I told him (as I had multiple times before) that he had to work on his mental health, and and we already postponed marriage almost 1 year. He only recently (when we took a break from the relationship) started getting therapy and meditating. He seems to be working on himself and like he “finally” wants to improve and change (he said being on the verge of losing me was his “wake-up call to action”), but it’s hard for me to fully believe it after all these years of emotional abuse. 

We are now basically in a state of limbo. I have no idea what to do. Everyone says I should leave him and maybe that’s true but I still can’t help but feel like he’s my soulmate.  I miss him so much and constantly want to talk to him. Whenever I see a funny meme or cat video, an interesting article, think of something strange he would chuckle at or appreciate, I want nothing more than to call him or text him. I love him so much and I wish our love didn’t have to be complicated by his abuse and mental health problems. I feel so stuck, sad, heartbroken, lonely, and confused. I can’t help but wonder if leaving him and not sticking around to see if he gets better will be something I’ll always regret, because I cannot imagine meeting someone I’ll love more than him.💔",2025-02-18 06:31:03,2025-03-17 03:29:02,help

So yeah I am to the point where I can’t take this anymore. He punched my tv when he was mad at a freaking video game.

An abusive or unhealthy relationship is a bad thing, and it's not the duty of any victim to help their abuser. However, while many of us hate the abuser or the things they have done to us, sometimes we still see their pain and torment, and the reasons why they have bren shaped into what they are. Sometimes we have a child with them and want them to be better parents. Sometimes we see that out own choices and actions could either help them or make them worse. 

A victim's first priority should always been themselves and their own safety, and that of any dependents. 

But if it is safe and/or unavoidable to be in contact with the abusive one, what things can we do to help them be better? What kind of things should we avoid that  make them worse?",2025-03-09 00:06:32,2025-03-17 03:29:07,help

I am on and off witn my abusive ex. You can find more info on my page but he slapped me really hard 5 years ago, made my nose bleed and I got a deviated septum from it. I developed PTSD and wake up some nights. We still see eachother about once a week and hang out for like 2 hours outside, but that’s it for now. I told him I need time to figure things out. He started going to a domestic abuse therapy program specifically for abusers. Most of the men who get sent there are court ordered, but he willingly went so he could prove to me that it would never happen again and that he’s safe to be around. He also pays for my therapy. He says he wants to do what’s best for me, even if I decide to never get back together.


 Anyway I’ve been seeing my psychotherapist for about 2.5 months now. She knows the story. Yesterday I told her I was feeling proud that I finally can see myself living without him. That I’ve had enough of feeling scared and that I want to put all this behind me. But I also said a part of me still loved him, and wished I could still be with him under different circumstance. This is when she had some ideas. She said if I choose to forgive him, then I *can* be happy in our relationship and let go of this anger and fear. She says I can do either EDMR or radical acceptance therapy. She says I need to come to terms with what happened (this is true). 

But I asked her “isn’t it bad to stay with someone who abused you? I would never tell my friend to stay if she was in this position.” And then she said because the abuse was only 1 time, because he’s going to therapy twice a month, and BECAUSE he’s paying for my therapy and being supportive, that she feels confident that he truly made a mistake and I might be able to accept it. She says forgiveness isn’t for the other person, it’s for me. I am willing to try the radical acceptance therapy for my PTSD. 

But I’m just so confused. I am lonely sure but I was pretty proud of how I am slowly breaking that trauma bond. And now she’s saying it would be okay to stay with him. I feel kind of triggered and I feel like she ruined the little stability I had. Would it really be okay to stay with him?   ",2023-12-19 15:22:37,2025-03-17 03:29:09,help

1iy10gx,"Male victim of abuse, need help",IAmChaabirasai,5,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iy10gx/male_victim_of_abuse_need_help/,"Hi,

First off, this is a long read, but I also hope it can help other men in my situation.

I'm a 40 year old male who is the victim of domestic abuse and violence in all categories,  emotional, psychological, and physical.

I'm safe now, my wife is away for military training. Trying to make my escape here in the next 5 months.
 
Were at the impasse, I'm willing to give her one chance to do something different, because we're married and I do care about her, but she needs to take accountability for her actions. I realize this is unlikely, but still I want to try once. It means taking accountability, actively seeking individual therapy (i was already doing this because i find value in therapy, but she scared my therapist away), and actively seeking couples therapy.

A little background, she is/was my friend of 15 years, friend only, pen pal so to speak. We had eventually agreed that we were platonic after she gave up on multiple past attempts to meet. A few years ago, she changed her mind and wanted to try. Prior to all this I had been going through a massive depressive and suicidal place in my life - i was coping with it using promiscuity. This all happened before we were together in any way.

I want to make clear, I'm aware I probably should have left far earlier but something stopped me from doing so early on.

Fast forward, she finally accomplishes traveling here and we meet. The second day she's here, she goes through my phone and makes all these wild assumptions, to which I just told her honestly that I was very promiscuous when I was going through some major depression and suicidal events in my life, and added that she saved my life and gave me hope.

She raged and destroyed the gifts I bought her and told me I didn't love her.

We worked through this and talked a lot and eventually got married. But it was only after we moved that the significant abuse started.

***I want to make clear to anyone who has been abused, our past choices and mistakes are not an excuse to abuse someone as a means to express their feelings***

July 2023, my wife starts a verbal argument about ""[the whores before her]"" and other stuff, I'm in my boxers and she punches me and then strangles me next to the kitchen, I retreat to the living room, she collapses the folding chair and hits me with it, proceeds to hit me with a barrage of punches one which I parry and gently roll her away from me, I retreat to the bedroom to get dressed so I can leave the house and let her cool down, when I'm getting my pants, she appears in the room with my keys in one hand and a kitchen knife (large for meat and veggies) in the other, approaches me about 1 foot away, and threatened to kill me and then herself. I'm sobbing and I truly believe I'm going to die in this moment. She continues her raging, grabs the pants from me and we struggled for them. She screams ""you bought these jeans with those whores"" and begins to slice the pants up. She then walks out of the room, returned the knife to the kitchen drawer (I know it was the drawer knife because one is kept in the drawer and the other kitchen knife sits in the wooden knife set holder). She returns to the room, sits on the bed in a meditation position and begins meditating like nothing happened. She claims she was looking for the scissors because she was angry at the pants but grabbed the knife because she couldnt find the scissors, but she didn't even see the pants until she was in the room when I was trying to put them on - the scissors are always in the knife stand. I texted 911, they came and arrested her, officers could see i was visibly shaking and in shock. They reported that my wife was uncooperative during the arrest in the police report.

My wife was just a new arrival to the US, so she had literally fucked her possibility of immigration, but because I love her I called off work, called my lawyer friends, and worked all night and day to get her out of jail -- I was new to this state and didn't know the domestic abuse laws required the perp to be arrested no matter what and that the police must press charges. Got her out and she was grateful, however one of the first comments she made on the drive home was ""they (the prisoners and guard) don't believe I did that because you're bigger"".

Court orders her non-violent contact and to get a psychiatric evaluation. She failed the violent contact the first day by picking fights about ""whores"" and screaming in the car and at home. She refused to go to the psychiatric evaluations, but changed her mind when I explained that if she doesn't comply, the judge could have her put back in jail.

Everything that follows is after the knife event. 

This would continue for, almost now, two years. Often it starts with her bringing up ""the whores.""

On some occasions violently attacking me while in trying to drive on highways sometimes over speeds of 70mph.

One time, I asked if I could have a few drinks with my buddy, asked if she could drive home, and she said okay to driving home. When we headed home, she drove wrecklessly and violently while screaming about ""whores"", all the while knowing I have severe passenger anxiety I do fine with most people. I refuse to be here passenger since then.

She has destroyed my property and claimed it was ""a gift from whores"" - it was a gift from a colleague at my first big job. She has destroyed other property at home. 

She kicked my car after a nice trip to a city I had a customer at, I didn't even need to being her. It started with her suddenly bringing up a specific ex-girlfriend (which has no significance in my life) then going on about whores, another incident where she assaulted me while I was in the highway. She kicked my car door when we arrived home.

On a few occasions at our apartment, she has screamed ""I will kill myself"" when I went to leave the apartment to de-escalate what I knew would turn into a fight. I took a drive to get some coffee to calm down and she called me and said ""I will kill myself and you don't care or love me,"" then I called the police with this first incident to do a wellness check, I couldn't stay there. The second event, I just went for a walk and she calmed down, knowing she was bluffing.

I tried to help her with her unemployment. Her boss was a former friend of mine. She quit on circumstances of discrimination. I helped her at an appeal hearing but there want enough. When we got home, she said ""I got scared and wanted to be friends with my old friend again"" (no, I was disgusted my former friend abused her position and failed to protect my wife), then called me a bitch and pussy. I was simply trying to help her with her unemployment and still have tried after that.

She has thrown objects and water on me at home.

She belittles me saying the car I bought her so she could be independent and have a job (brand new) ""wasn't a BMW"". 

She threw her friend under the bus, gaslighting her friend into believing I was the abuser. I told her you leave after this, he friend came by (disillusioned by my wifes lies) helped her take all her stuff. My wife after a day or two ""missed me"" and wanted to see me. So we did, we tried a fresh start. After a few days longer, she told her friend she  wanted to go home. Her friend was pissed, and describe me wife's actions as ""having shit on her"" after all she has done for her.

The most recent abuse was her starting an argument when she was at training, her claiming I ""would start shit"" at her graduation. I ended that call and told her I was my coming. Another act of her abuse, this time passive aggressive using false assumptions and projection.

Since then we haven't talked.

There are other small things, like she was allegedly abused by her ex-husband, but when she called him for something related to selling a house, he sounded aggrieved and his words were those of someone who had been cheated on and had been betrayed. I can only speculate on this but, it doesn't match her description of events. And then there is her denial of all the past relationships she used to always contact me about and ask me for advice about.

Am I crazy? Am I being abused? I surely know I am, but I feel so fucking hopeless right now.

I want to help her get help, but my instinct says ""run the fuck away and disappear"".

Please help.

Thank you for your time.

My (f40s) partner (M40s) said I should go ahead and call AmEx tonight so I did.  This is where it gets weird, he sat next to me on the couch and he asked “who gave you the idea to call AmEx?” I replied that I did and that I took his suggestion to go ahead and call them.  He just STARED at me while I was looking straight ahead at the tv.  I have no idea why this bothered him (I didn’t give enough credit to him?? For what I don’t know).  Anyways, I put my credit card in my purse in the other room and he told me not to leave in the middle of an argument (I didn’t know we were in one) and I should have just brought the purse to the room (no clue why that way was better).  Fast forward a few minutes and he came behind me saying mean things and had just started recording since I had a feeling he was in this mood….  And that was when he attacked me and tried to grab the phone out of my hands and grabbed my hoodie on my sweatshirt and pulled it so hard the hood ripped off and half the shirt is ripped down the front.  He pulled my hair and was super aggressive.  At some point when he was grabbing me, his left arm went in front of my mouth so I bit it to get him to loosen up his grip.  He got my phone and refused to give it back to me.  I grabbed my purse, my dog, and my work laptop and got out of the house after begging and pleading for him to give me my phone back - about 20ish minutes.  (He also accused me of stealing his phone bc he lost it, I didn’t)

I left and sat in a parking lot and I took a couple calls and tried to tell him I wasn’t coming back.  He told me I was cheating on him since I wouldn’t tell him exactly where I was.  So I FaceTimed him and showed him it was just me and the dog.  After we hung up, I drove to another parking lot.  I tried ignore his texts and calls until I couldn’t but after 20 min of texts and more accusations of cheating I just gave up and shut my eyes.  I heard the phone ring a few times but didn’t answer,  eventually checked my texts and I saw a video of him throwing away my 5 pairs of Loubitins (btw, I don’t make crazy money but these have been purchased as rewards to myself over the last 7 years).  

I finally decided to go back, hoping he was asleep and to find my shoes and pack to get out of there for a week.  

He was not asleep and he gaslit me on the shoes (he sent me a video of him throwing them away which is why I showed up and trash day is tomorrow)…found out my personal laptop was also missing.  He accused me of losing it but I stuck it on the desk when I unpacked earlier today.  He kept calling me crazy and for me to take my meds (I am not crazy and I am not on any meds).  So after 20-30 min of looking, even bringing back the trash can from the street and emptying it looking for the shoes (one empty box was on top) the shouting ensued and then he gaslit me again…. “You ripped your own shirt” “you took the hoodie off” “it’s how they are work now” “well the under shirt isn’t ripped so how could I have done that”

I told him to get my my laptop or I’d call the cops and he said he would and then he did…. He put the phone in my face when they answered, I assumed he would hang up, but when he didn’t I finally said “he attacked me” and then I left the room when I heard him say a lie and so they were sending someone out.  

I panicked and started packing again, got 2 small bags in the car and then they showed up.  

I didn’t know what to say or do to them.  I freaked out - I didn’t want them to arrest him (I’m too nice) and I didn’t want someone to arrest me for my self defense to get him off me and stop him from strangling me more with the shirt with the bite.  (There IS a nasty red line around my neck and it burns) I also don’t want them to think I’m crazy and need meds - bc I don’t.  Or that I’m the abuser.  

I heard one cop talking to him and the cop said “well that will do it” to something he said so who knows what lie (or lies) was told.  He can be very charming.

I don’t know what to do - the cops want me to go to police station tomorrow evening for a full statement.  I don’t want to get arrested.  I don’t want him to get arrested.  Any help or advice what they might do if I give a detailed statement but don’t take action?  Will they decide to open it up anyways?  

The cops took photos of my neck and shirt and gave me a couple pages on victims to look at.  (They also let me go grab some clothes)

TL:DR - I was physically attacked on the couch and I bit his arm when they were wrapped around me and strangling me with my shirt.  I left for a few hours, went back when i found out he threw expensive shoes out.  He kept at it when he wouldn’t tell me where some of my stuff is, threatened to call the cops but he did it instead.  I don’t know what to do?  I don’t want to get arrested - or him.  I want to be believed.  What happens after you give your statement?  (They also gave me a couple printouts on victim help)

(Edit to add; this morning I went to grab something from my car, my personal laptop was in the back, I don’t remember putting it there bc I would have put it with my work laptop in my front.  I’m not sure if he put it there when I wasn’t looking or if for some reason I was so scared and heightened that I don’t remember putting it there (but again, it doesn’t make sense for me to put it caddy corner on its side like I found it)",2025-02-10 09:17:06,2025-03-17 03:29:18,help

Obviously throw away account. I need advice and help. So I am to be married in 3 weeks to my partner of almost 9 years.

We bought a house together and have pets, no kids, and getting engaged and married was the next, expected thing. 
The problem is my fiancé is….well it’s not good. I’m strong, and I’ll be okay, but he’s emotionally and physically abusive and it’s been getting worse and worse. His drinking is out of control and he has been having trouble holding a job. I have been paying our mortgage and all our bills for almost a year. 

Why you ask are we getting married if this is the case? Because I am an idiot, and I love him, and I let his family convince me into having the wedding. I thought things would get better. Here we are 3 weeks out and everything is bad. I cannot marry this man. I need advice on legally how I can get out of this marriage without embarrassment. Can I fake go through the wedding without legally filing and without getting in trouble? His uncle is the officiant and I don’t want him in any trouble either. We’re in Texas.

Me (F19) and my partner (F22) are currently in a BIG fight over something we've fought about before.

So for a little background, I have ADHD and struggle with emotional regulation/sensory issues, which doesn't excuse any negative behaviors but I feel like it's still important.

My girlfriend has grabbed me and held me down MULTIPLE times because she because she believed I was a ""danger"" to myself even though I've told her multiple times that I hate being restricted in that way and I can't tolderate it. I have memories of her laying on top of me and grabbing my arms very tightly and me yelling for her to get off but she wouldn't. This memory followed with me first trying to physically pushing her off, but then when that didn't work I started hitting at her. This was after multiple times of me telling her to get off of me. Due to this, I accidentally gave her a very faded black eye. I felt awful about it obviously, but she blamed me and told me that not matter what happens I should NEVER hit her or lay my hands on her that way.

That wasn't the first time either -- it has happened plenty of times where I clearly tell her ""stop"" and ""get off"" and when I can't take it anymore I get physical with her just to get her off of me. She has called me abusive for this. She also told me that she would never hit me the way that I hit her. I feel very conflicted with myself, because of COURSE I take no pleasure in hurting her.. but isn't it at least a little bit justifyable if I have told her MULTIPLE TIMES to please not touch me / get off of me? I get overtstimulated incredible easy, and I get scared too. I'm a nervous train wreck. 

Our most recent fight was over her yelling at me, me getting upset, and trying to scoot away from her because I did not want to be touched. She took that as an opportunity to ""act"" offended and then press her hands and body against me (in her words), a ""playful"" manner. Of course, that did not feel like that AT ALL to me. It felt like my skin was being ripped apart but I tried my best to tell her to ""stop"" without sounding too angry. So I had told her verbally to stop, and yet she did not stop. It all felt like too much and I was overwhelmed from being yelled at and now the disrespectful touching so without thinking I kicked her legs away from me. Right after this, she starting yelling at me saying stuff like ""what is wrong with you?!"" and she threw a pillow hard to my face storming off. 

She then starting texting me about how I shouldn't be ""hitting people"" and that she won't tolerate me putting my hands on her any longer. I told her that it's just like before, and I give her multiple chances to respect my boundaries when I'm incredibly overwhelmed but she doesn't listen to me. What else am I supposed to do? If she won't listen to be verbally, the only thing I can do is retaliate physically. I would never PURPOSEFULLY hurt my girlfriend with the intention of hurting her. The only thing I want to do is get her to stop touching me when I tell her no. I don't hit her out of anger- I do it out of fear and overstimulation. The second she's not touching me anymore all I do is lay in a corner and try my best to calm down.

She's told me in her text that she's breaking up with me if I think it's okay to hit her. OBVIOUSLY I don't think it's okay to hit her, but she makes it about herself everytime I feel like my boundaries are being crossed. Am I actually an abusive partner? Am I being gaslit? I don't know what's happening anymore.. I'm tired about fighting over this again and again. She believes that me hitting her is worse than her crossing my boundaries (physically). ""Crossing your boundaries is one thing, and hitting me is another."" I'm terrified of the idea that I'm abusive, but I'm willing to change if that's the case. I don't want to be a bad person.

1iegqan,"What did people say (or act), that helped you leave?",tahynnuf,12,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iegqan/what_did_people_say_or_act_that_helped_you_leave/,"TL;DR: A loved one is in an abusive relationship. It's incredibly hard to watch. If you left your abuser, did anyone say or do anything in particular, that helped you towards making that choice? 

  
Longer version:

  
I know that this channel is full of people saying 'help me help them leave', and I know that the general answer is 'you can't, just be there for them' - but that's so hard to accept. I was hoping that someone had had an epiphany once, because a loved one said something, that made you more likely to leave. Then I can steal that and use it.

  
A loved one is in a very abusive relationship and she has really only just realised it (sort of) now. It's serious. CPS is involved, threatening to remove the baby. Her family, the abuser's family, the council, her therapist, the crisis centre for victims of domestic abuse, the baby's nursery, all of her friends - all say the same thing: GET OUT. HE IS DANGEROUS. But she has been so brainwashed. It's so scary, so incredibly scary.

  
She just left, after he got physical with her again. She says it's the second time he violently shoved her (and the baby), but she also keeps saying ""I've not even told you the worst stuff"", so I feel like there's much more. He has ruined her self-esteem. I read his messages and it's the most intense example of gaslighting I have ever seen (and I've been in abusive relationships too). Every single one of her thoughts and feelings are immediately invalidated. One of the reasons she says she won't leave is because ""what if she's making it all up"" and ""she's always overreacting anyways"".

  
She finally got away from him. And has stayed with me for three days. She was so close. She even decided to never return. We were almost there. Then he called her. Begged and cried. Told her she was ruining his life. She now ""owes it to him to return and give it a shot"" and ""give him a second chance"". Even though CPS seriously warned her against going back to him.

  
I feel like I've tried everything. But I'm also autistic, so I'm not good at the feelings bit. I just keep telling her factual things about abuse, showing her graphs and shouting that she needs to leave and she's in danger. I know it's probably not helping one bit. I might even be making it worse. But I feel like I am sending her back to be murdered. I can't physically keep her away from him and this situation.

  
I know I have to accept that it's out of my hands. 

  
So I was hoping someone had any ideas about what to say. What to do. I have a hard time accepting that there isn't a 'magic switch' that would make her realise that she needs to stay away. Anything I say, she says, ""You're overreacting"". Trust me, I am not. 

  
Thank you if you've read all that. I hope that by writing this here, I can keep myself from just... screaming at her that I don't want her to die. ",2025-01-31 15:03:06,2025-03-17 03:29:28,help

I am truly hoping this will help with the situation.

In the mean time i have to deal with a lot coming from him. Pretty much just him being moody, mad easily, whether it’s at me or cause of something else, and he’s verbally explosive and when I talk or say anything trying to address his behavior he tries to shut me up and raises his voice.

But what i can say is he at least comes around after his anger settles and he seems to feel bad and comforts me and always says and “intends” on not wanting to repeat the same mistake again, he truly believes (and to me it seems like) the things he does is out of his control when he’s in the moment and he’s always embarrassed afterwards about it. He’s down for the anger management and knows this isn’t fair to me.

All of the sudden, he's mad cleaning. Ya'll... I've been up since 2am this morning. My job today was to shovel out stalls full of horse poop, pee and hay, from 8am - 4:15pm. Of course, we had our breaks and lunch, but I busted my ass and did the best I could. This job pays daily, and the money is needed. My body still feels beat up and tired, He comes home 30 minutes after me. I sit down next to him, after I get out of the shower. He says, ""it stinks like shit. The kitty litter smells like shit"". Yes, I have to get more kitty litter, I admit but I get nothing else from him. He tends to overexaggerate the negative feelings he has about the things I do wrong (in his eyes). After he says that, he just gets up and leaves. Fast forward about 30 more minutes or so and he starts slamming doors and ""cleaning"" angrily. Mind you, he didn't really clean much. He slammed the door to the room and he's in there. Now, I'm feeling slightly threatened and a little scared.

How do I navigate this and keep myself safe?

The more I work, the angrier he'll get because things around the house will not be getting done, in the way he wants. I honestly fear for my safety, when I have to come home.

I reached out to a shelter that helps women, but she said they're at their full and can't help me. She asked me a bunch of questions before and then denied me. I personally felt I wasn't as important or the situation wasn't as bad, in her eyes. I'm going to call more places and see if someone could help me. I believe me becoming silent and not talking to him that much, could've caused him to spiral, in a way. I was protecting my energy. He literally tells me to shut up, while im talking. Also, when im talking, he just interrupts me without saying excuse me or sorry. Then, he'll just get up and leave me. Or he'll just completely ignore me. HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

I don't know how to navigate this safely.",2025-03-11 02:12:44,2025-03-17 03:29:31,help

My bf and I frequently get into arguments over the way he talks to me. I often feel belittled, criticized, and I'm always the butt of his jokes. It almost feels like he's trying to disguise his put downs as jokes. For example, he'll make a joke about me being fat, old, or otherwise unattractive and then insist that it's just a joke. I've lost track of how many times I've told him to tone it down (he will make multiple, sometimes cruel, ""jokes"" like this over and over in one sitting), and I've repeatedly told him that the frequency of these ""jokes"" makes it hard for me to pass them off as just jokes when it's relentless sometimes. Whenever I tell him that these ""jokes"" aren't funny and ask him to please just stop, he will say I'm ""too sensitive"" or that I have ""a stick up my butt"". He will say that this is just how he jokes, and that by me asking him to stop, I'm asking him to change as a person. Sometimes, he'll try to punish me by saying things like, ""OK, well then I just won't joke around with you at all anymore if you're going to get so offended at everything."" Or he'll talk in a flat, intentionally boring voice afterwards, or sometimes just not talk to me at all. 

I'm frequently left feeling confused, because other than this, I feel like he does love and care for me. But this whole thing has become beyond frustrating, because he isn't acknowledging how his behavior hurts me, and he isn't willing to stop even when I've repeatedly told him how much it bothers me. He just dismisses my feelings, and I know this is a big red flag. 

I feel like couples therapy might be our best chance at fixing this, but I get mixed signals from him on whether or not he's willing to try. He's told me that he doesn't want to do couples therapy because he doesn't trust that a therapist will actually try to help (because he thinks they have a financial incentive to keep us fighting/coming back). But he's also told me that this is the best relationship he's been in, and that he'll do whatever it takes to make it work. The real problem is, neither of us have the money for it right now.

I guess I'm just wondering if any of you have had an experience like this and if couples therapy (or anything else) has helped the situation or not.",2025-03-11 07:11:51,2025-03-17 03:29:34,help

1j9frvx,"If someone with abusive tendencies wants to get help & change, but if the chances of change are low then what are they suppose to do? (also have a couple other questions)",Careless-Internet171,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j9frvx/if_someone_with_abusive_tendencies_wants_to_get/,"My understanding is the majority of people say that someone who is abusive will likely not ever change, however I’ve also seen many say that while a person is still in their early 20’s and growing that they do have a higher chance of being able to change for the better. This is assuming that the person really wants to change and understands that what they are doing is not okay. What are your thoughts on that?

Onto my main question. If abusive people really never change then what are they suppose to do? They get to continue to free roam the world as an abuser, and are they also not ever suppose to be able to get into a relationship? Obviously they shouldn’t subject others to their abusive ways, and nobody deserves to be put through that. But if they want to change and if we’re going with the belief that no abuser will ever be able to change then are they just suppose to be single and possibly sad/alone forever?

Side thought but why can’t some abusers care enough to change and not be abusive anymore? Not only for themselves but so they can happily be in a relationship too?

Another question, but is there a difference between a full blown abuser - like maybe someone who perhaps thinks abusive thoughts every day all the time, and someone who generally doesn’t think that way or have intentions to be abusive but then have small hiccups here and there when they are really upset and under pressure?

Thanks in advance, I’m just trying to understand some things ):

1g0p2pt,Help!! How did you realize you were in an abusive relationship?,Dangerous-Gift-5859,23,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1g0p2pt/help_how_did_you_realize_you_were_in_an_abusive/,"I'd like to hear from others experiences. Like many people when I think about abusive relationships I imagine a person who physically hurts someone, yells at them, humiliate them in public etc etc. But it's much harder to recognize abuse when it's not that overt. It doesn't help that I have low self-esteem that comes from childhood abuse.

I've been married for 18 years, two kids. He used to be sweet and kind in the beginning but over the years he has become increasingly self centered. Look, I try to be realistic about marriage, I have my shortcomings too and far from perfect and I know all marriages inevitably change with time. But I feel like I might be in denial and the thought of getting a divorce feels terrifying. But here are some personal examples:

- He used to apologize when he hurt my feelings. That hardly ever happens now. If I bring it up he usually gets defensive. When something goes wrong he acts like it was either me or the kids' fault.

 - When I had our babies both times I asked him to spend the night at the hospital with me but he said there was no bed for him there and he needed to rest. With our first child he even slept in and got a the hospital at noon the next day.

- I love talking about politics and social issues (I have a bachelors in Sociology). He's not that interested in those topics, which is fine, it's not for everyone. But when I start talking about it after a few minutes he'll act uninterested, sometimes straight up say it or even roll his eyes. Mind you, when he talks about his own interests I at least try to listen.

- Housework basically falls on me. We have a big house and it's overwhelming for me (I also work outside the house). The thing he basically does is to load and unload the dishwasher. When I complain about him not doing more around the house he gets defensive (again) and says I should relax about chores because I'm too picky about cleanliness. He'll then claim hes doing work equally since he's the one mowing the lawn and shoveling snow. But those are things that need to be done only during a few months a year, and the snow shoveling is basically done by our 14 year old now.

- At night when he and the kids go to bed I stay up to clean the kitchen. The next day he complains that I made too much noise cleaning the kitchen and interrupted his sleep. And if I say ""well someone has to clean it"", he again gets defensive and says ""I can do it in the morning (he works from home), but then he doesn't most of the time.

- He belittles my job and says I should get one that pays better. But he says it in a subtle way like ""you deserve better"", which is probably true, but I feel like he just wants me to make more money so he can quit his current job and become a college professor, which will basically pay 1/2 of what he makes now. Mind you, I've always been supportive of him becoming a professor. My current job is 25 hours a week but I feel like even if I get one thats 40 hours and make more money the house work thing will not change that much. He was unemployed a while ago for 4 months and would be on the couch all day, watching tv or or his phone. I'd get home from work and make dinner, do laundry and cleaning. 

- If we both have work meetings at the same time he expects me to figure out a way to pick up the kids at school.

- When I'm really really overwhelmed I might ask him to do the grocery shopping (I do it 99% of the time). He does it but makes a bug fuss. 

- a lot of times when I need to vent about something he'll find a way to make it about himself. I traveled to my home country during summer and when I came home I was really said and crying a lot because I missed my country and it was difficult ""transitioning"" back to my old routine. He seemed puzzled by my emotions and kinda annoyed, if you know what I mean. 

- When we go out as a family (when we can actually get him to want to go) a lot of times he'll become impatient and look bored. So for the past few years I just take the kids out myself, and tbh the mood feels ""lighter"". He has a hard time relaxing and being flexible. Everything has to be planned and timely, including vacations and outings. 

Sorry for the long post. But I feel I need to come to terms and find out if I really am in an abusive relationship, and if counseling can fix it or it its beyond salvation now. I appreciate any inputs from those who have been through similar situation. ",2024-10-10 18:05:24,2025-03-17 03:29:42,help

I (26F) am posting on behalf of my best friend (25F) in reference to a jarring experience I witnessed with her this past weekend. For ease of reading I’ll call my best friend A & her boyfriend B (30-something M. I can never remember, he’s around 33/34 I think though) 

So A & B started dated a little under a year ago & they recently moved in together (Jan 2025) to the house that he owns. Since they started dating A has definitely become more distant but it was a new relationship so I wasn’t too worried about it because they just seemed happy & in love! Over the past year-ish I’ve noticed a few times where she was extra distant and checked in on her. She’s let me know about some pretty intense fights stemming from insecurity from him, i.e. being upset with the fact that she’s dated people before him. Which is already incredibly immature but that really isn’t even the worst of it & really never made me super concerned. 

More recently she’s been using language pretty flippantly that has been making me grow more & more concerned but her & her safety in this relationship. For some context, I went through a pretty severe abusive relationship when I was 19 so I always have my ear out for signs & I may be more hyperaware than others & could be blurring the lines of normal relationship quarrels & abuse because I experienced it. 

Last week, she mentioned that she accidentally locked the door on her way out to an appointment while he was walking the dog (with no house key) and told me seemingly jokingly “i’m scared about when I get home lol” and this is not the first time she’s used verbiage like that in reference to his behavior or reactions to things. This set off all of my alarm bells & I told my boyfriend that I am growing concerned & need to talk to her about it. On top of this, anytime we have had any girlfriend gatherings with our other friends or just her & I, she’s requested we do them at her house (with BF) because B is more comfortable with that. AGAIN, red flag but it’s a big house & we all live in apartments so no big deal but still strange. 

So here’s where things grew past concern/worry, to reality of at minimum mental/emotional abuse. On Saturday, she told me that she didn’t have any plans because B was busy all day doing various things with his friends. So we made plans to hang out at a bar with a cool DJ set from 3-6pm. The original plan was that she will uber to the bar we are at, then her BF realized they both are going to the same area around the same time so he said he will just drop her off, original ETA was 330pm. 330 passes, still waiting on him, 4 passes, 430, she doesn’t get there until 5pm & the SECOND he drops her off he texts her and i quote, “Not Good. Makes me second guess everything.” ALARM BELLS SOUNDING LEFT AND RIGHT. He continues texting her more narcissistic, manipulative phrases like “we’ll talk when i get home.” “not happy” “you didn’t tell me how big of an event it was.” 

KEEP IN MIND!! We were with a group of 6 other couples (including me & my boyfriend THAT HE’S MET BEOFRE) and that was it. It was a very chill bar, we’re all sitting gathered around a table on the patio, absolutely nothing crazy going on. 

He continues to send her angry texts & she just decides to leave bc she’s crying at this point. She had been at the bar for all of 20m. I tried to tell her that this is exactly what he wants & he’s trying to manipulate you into going home & feeling like you did something wrong, & that this is textbook narcissistic abuse. She ultimately decided to leave because I quote “he’s going to be drinking a lot today & I don’t want to make it worse when he gets home”

I got flashbacks to my own abuse, I used to say that exact phrase when I was trying to convince myself that if I just behaved better, he would stop hitting me. Now, I don’t know what’s going on at home & I’m probably projecting to some degree but I can’t deny what I saw with my own two eyes. I told her I’m here for her & I won’t judge her & that I will continue supporting her but that she needs to reevaluate the relationship & quickly. 

So… am i overreacting because of my history with abuse or does my friend really need help? Any advice is appreciated. TIA. ",2025-03-10 17:57:40,2025-03-17 03:29:48,help

My ex and I were together six years, but I recently left when the relationship became abusive. We have two kids together (ages 1 and 3) and he has a child from a previous relationship. Since all of our issues hit the fan and legal proceedings got involved, he's completely abandoned our children. He hasn't tried to send anything at all (nor his family). Forthwrmore, one of our children's birthdays was two weeks ago and his other child's birthday (from his previous relationship) is today. Heard nothing at all from him on our baby's birthday and his family said they'd get her gifts this week (which to me is messed up that they'd wait to get it) and I've yet to hear anything since then. 

Today, my ex has been playing songs like ""Color him Father"" and a whole bunch of other stuff to paint himself as a great dad....on this other child's birthday. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, I'm so upset and more so because I just don't get it. How can someone really try to paint themselves as great knowing they're completely, literally, not doing anything at all or tryi it to be in his two youngest babies lives while pouring into another. 

For context: I found out he was abusive to his ex as well, which is a big reason why they broke up and her family cannot stand him. Their situations never had police involved. I don't know if things have changed now, but it also why she would never tell him where she lived and they'd have to exchange their child at her mothers house. I thought it was because he cheated on her..but I guess that was just a small part of the story.

He converted her to his religion and has successfully isolated her from old friends.  She only hangs out with people at church now and is constantly on eggshells trying not to upset him.  I talk to her about the red flags I see and the things she should be looking for in a healthy relationship.   They have plans to get married bc his religion is very strict.  Currently they technically are not allowed to have any physical contact (hold hands, be alone in a car together, etc). 

Since they are so serious I’ve offered to pay for couples counseling and have bought books for them to look at about healthy relationships. (There is a lot of coercive control and manipulation happening from his end) 

She is scared to mention anything of the sort to him and begs me not to intervene in any way.  I know that if I talk to his parents the relationship will be ended by them ASAP. I am so worried about her future with him that I’ve considered doing that.  Any thoughts on what else I could do or whether you would speak with them? 

Edit: Context on levels of abuse: 

Mostly emotional abuse and possible escalation toward physical abuse. (She told me that she is afraid he will hit her someday because when he is “pretending” to be violent he has grabbed her throat and shaken her previously) 

Emotional abuse including: not allowing her to have friends, berating her for “micro cheating” if she talks to any males at school, demanding that she be on FaceTime all night so he can keep tabs on her, demanding that she makes his lunch to bring to him at school and then getting upset when she doesn’t pack it correctly, invalidating her thoughts and feelings and intelligence. Becoming angry, moody, self harming, threatening suicide if she sets up boundaries. Punishing her by ignoring her and refusing to communicate when she goes on family trips, etc. 

Edit: our relationship- 

I’m a single mom and her dad has been minimally involved in her life since she was 12.  We have a trusting, strong relationship.  She talks to me about all of these things and listens but seems to feels very committed and stuck in the relationship. Our relationship is somewhat strained now partially bc it is easy to say the wrong thing to upset her, or if he is around, it’s easy to get her “in trouble” with him and make things really bad for her later.

1ig5u6t,Has anyone on here actually gotten help from the DV shelter?

People think DV shelters are safe
But the one I went to wasnt. They (the workers) spent more time scrutinizing my parenting and accusing me of things that I didnt do. And they let some of the residents yell at me when my baby cried. I wad also falsely accused of stealing food
They also had no resources to help me get independence. I was not elegible for any of the resources that they had. A couple of their workers also screamed at me when I had a panic attack because of how some of their residents treated me. I also witnessed several of the moms there hitting/spanking their children in front of the cameras and in front of everyone. 

The DV shelter was a very traumatizing experience and helped me realize that leaving my ex was a huge mistake. 

The workers also kept asking me over and over and over and over if I can stay with family. They even called my family to confirm it. And the shelter that I went to after that (the family shelter) was similar but the DV shelter was worse. 

I have a home now but its not because of the shelter. I rented a room for me and my son to share and the house has roommates. (The government housing list was full so obviously that did not help either) 

I was not elegible for their motel to home program either because the motel to home program was paid for through the school system and my son is not old enough to be in school yet.

When I applied for TANF they lost my application. I applied for it in person at the office cause they did not allow me to apply for it online. 

And the family shelter coincidentally happened to be located RIGHT NEXT DOOR to one of my exs favorite places. (It was a store that my ex introduced me to that had only one location. He took me there a long time ago before we officially started dating)

I should be happy that I have a room now but I honestly miss living with my ex cause it felt like more of a family setting. 

All the shelter workers that asked me if I can stay with family didnt seem to realize that my ex/ baby daddy was the only ""family"" that me and my son had that actually cared about me.

So can I help someone who hasn’t asked me for help?


Here’s the situation:


I’m not that close with my sister in law, and I think that is by design from her husband. He doesn’t let her get close to anybody.


They have two young children, and he has decided to move them overseas, back to his home country. She does not speak the language. She knows no one there. She will be living with his mother and brother in a remote village. 


He will stay behind for 3 months, then join them there.


A few days ago I got a moment alone with her, and told her she can’t get on that plane.


She doesn’t want to… but she feels she has no other option. She can’t work with two small children, and they aren’t vaccinated so aren’t allowed in daycare.


I don’t think she is aware of hague convention laws that are often abused to separate expat mothers from their children.


I want to help her. But I don’t know how. 


To be clear she has not explicitly asked for my help. 


To be clear there is a lot of assumption on my part here. But I don’t think I’m wrong……


Is there any way I can help her?


My very real fear is her partner (illegally) owns multiple assault rifles. They are in a safe in their house. I’m not convinced he wouldn’t use them………


They leave in less than a week.


Any advice is appreciated. 


Thank you.

I had a health scare, he wasn’t supportive and that was a turning point for me. I got therapy which helped me learn to love myself and set boundaries, and importantly see things more clearly which eventually led me to exit the relationship. 

I’m doing pretty well (on paper) since the break up. Got a promotion at work, pursuing my hobbies, keeping physically and mentally fit etc (quit smoking), expanding social circle etc.

The problem I am facing is a pull back to him, he continues to reach out and want to meet up and I genuinely want to stay in touch and be civil.

I have been lurking on reddit for years and am well aware of the hook that trauma bonds have on us and I guess I am after a reminder and some reassurance that going back to him or even entertaining the idea is not in anyone’s best interest. I know cold turkey / no contact is the best way but why does it feel so fucking hard?

To summarise very briefly our whole relationship we would have massive blow up arguments, where I’d be yelled at and told how selfish I was and how everything was my fault, that I was crazy and needed help. Then no speaking for several days, maybe a week. This could be over really small trivial things. I can very easily tap into those highly stressful and anxious feelings right now, and I fear if that will that ever go away? I worry that I am so damaged from it all that all I deserve is the person that did that to me because they were the only person that could make it all ok again - once they come around and act like nothing happened , showing me love and everything is ok.

I wanted kids with him so much, and would be told that I was too immature to be a mother. Now because of my health issues as well as getting older, I don’t even know if having kids will be a reality for me now and honestly it’s that that hurts me the most. That I so wanted children with the man I loved and he shut me down for years. I won’t go into marriage but I told him I wanted that too but he also told me that although he wanted to marry me he didn’t want to spend the money on a ring.

I’m not really sure exactly the purpose me posting but I guess I need a reminder and some assurance that I have already done the hardest job, which is leaving, and I will only makes things harder for myself if I start hooking back up and getting back into that relationship.

1jczfap,I need help,bajatoad,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jczfap/i_need_help/,"Hello, I really need to know if I’m in the wrong or crazy. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend since last February and things have gotten really bad. I met him in January and at the time he was 17, then turning 18 in April (I was 18 going on 19 later that year in October). I had just gotten out of a five year abusive relationship with my ex. 

It started in March when he started to treat me bad, but he would always say how he’s a bad boyfriend. Quickly after, he would start calling me names like “whore, bitch, stupid, idiot, retarded…” etc. He would say that we were breaking up, but the next day everything would be back to normal again. 

He doesn’t give me the same respect that I give him. I removed all lot of guys off my phone for him, without him having to ask, because I saw that they made him feel uncomfortable. He would make remarks about the guys on my phone so I just removed them. 

Sometime in March we got into a fight and he came down to see me. (For better context, my ex abused me mentally and physically so I grew very nervous around men) We were sitting near pond and I guess I was speaking over him and he threatened to hit me if I didn’t stop talking. 

I started to get really depressed because of this and I couldn’t hide it anymore. He would constantly say that I need to get better and I really was trying to get better, but he would make it worse, so I didn’t know how. He constantly blamed everything on me. 

(Because of my ex, I didn’t trust him 100% in the beginning and I was nervous a lot. My ex would constantly cheat, manipulate, and abuse me everyday for 5 years, so yeah.. that did a number on me) My boyfriend knows what my ex did to me and still continued to abuse me mentally. 

In August I went up on the train to see him because we had a big argument and he was ignoring me. (He stonewalls me every time he’s mad and I can’t take it. He knows that I have really bad abandonment issues because of my childhood, and still did it to hurt me.) He picked me up from the train station and all he did was verbally abuse me. I was bawling my eyes out and trying to hold his arm for comfort and he said that he was going to kill me/us and crash the car. Later that day we went to a carnival together and he acted like nothing ever happened. 

I personally think that porn or watching anything online is cheating. (That’s just me.) The other day he said that he was on Reddit and then I heard sounds of him jerking off. I asked if that’s what he was doing and he said no. I brought it up the next day and he said that he was watching stuff I’ve sent him. But his stories aren’t lining up, he constantly does this and gaslights me. I feel like I’m going crazy in my head. He’s really good at manipulating people and making me seem like the crazy girlfriend. 

Last night I went through his phone because I had suspicions of him cheating. There was nothing on his Reddit, but when I went into Snapchat, there were multiple girls on there. He was telling girls to pull up to a festival that he was at, and I couldn’t go that day. So I woke him up and confronted him. It went terribly. He got in my face and called me a retard and many other things. He started punching my bed and said that if he didn’t do that, then he would punch me. I was able to record what he said. He left but came back later that night and ignored me. This morning I asked him if we could talk about it again and it went bad aswell. He said that I need to get myself together and that I need to get better and I need to go back to the pychward to get better. (I went years ago because I tried to off myself because my ex was telling me to take more pills and that I was worthless.) He told me that he doesn’t care about me and he won’t remove the girls. 

My problem with the girls is that he told me he removed them, and lied to me about it, and he doesn’t show any signs of remorse. I would never add or talk to guys behind his back. I just want the same respect back. He tells me that I’m insecure and crazy, but he’s a very insecure person. I always tell him how handsome he is, and that I love every part of him (and I really do.) Last week he went through my following and sent me a picture of my cousin and said “WTF WERE OVER”. I told him that it was my cousin but he still blocked me. He came back the next day. 

I’m exhausted and he’s taken everything out of me. 

And I know that I’m not perfect at all, and I do make mistakes, but I don’t purposefully try to hurt him. I’ve definitely changed since we first started dating. In our first argument I asked if he was stupid (I didn’t know how to communicate at that time and just had left my abusive ex), he told me not to speak to him like that, and it clicked in my head. I didn’t want to become what my ex was, and I knew i didn’t want to treat him like that. For months I worked on myself, but he would say that I wasn’t changing at all. But I knew I was changing. 

He wonders why I don’t trust him, but he constantly lies about small things and it makes me wonder if he lies about bigger things too. On Thanksgiving I caught him with a vape and he said that he didn’t care. He told me to stop smoking weed back in March, so I stopped. So it really hurt to find out that he didn’t care and was going to continue if he didn’t get caught. A little part of me still believes that he’s doing it. 

(I’m new to Reddit so I’m sorry if I don’t understand too much hhh. I’m also sorry if things are in a weird order, I’m writing this as things come to my mind.) ",2025-03-16 23:55:01,2025-03-17 03:31:07,help

1i9v6sq,Autistic woman seeking help understanding / processing a situation.,-sadanon-,3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1i9v6sq/autistic_woman_seeking_help_understanding/,"This is a throwaway / anon account for me. I'm posting here bc I feel like this community would be well rounded and able to look at things in an unbiased way (hopefully). While this does seem like an abuse-type tactic I don't know that my wife is intentionally being ""bad"". I am also to blame, I know I'm not good at communication.

I (30f) am autistic & I make a lot of scrunch faces and often close my eyes while I'm processing information. Specially when there's a lot of other noises going on. I also have an extremely stunted understanding of emotions/feelings. My wife often gets her feelings hurt by this and has recently begun just stopping mid-sentence and walking away from me. (Which triggers some sort of extreme rejection sensitivity in myself or something? I'm not sure). I have tried to explain to her multiple times that I'm not mad at her, I'm not upset with her, I'm listening and thinking and processing. She says ""I see your frustration and it hurts my heart""(that feels so needlessly dramatic to me but probably bc I don't have a very strong emotional range for anything). Idk how to fix that bc there's no frustration until she starts to walk away and I've told her that. Like NOW there's frustration bc you're stopping mid conversation, asserting I'm feeling a way that I'm not, and shutting down the conversation?

Today she was telling me about a friend of hers who she often compares me to and telling me something he did to alleviate his social anxiety/ stress. As I'm listening I'm thinking about a few things:

a)I'm tired of hearing about him tbh.

b)What she's describing isn't how I feel about/during/after social interactions.

c)how can I tell her I appreciate her concern but I don't feel that way without upsetting her.

And I guess in my processing & thinking I furrowed my brow/pursed my lips so she said ""ok I see your frustration, I'm going."" and tossed her hands up in the air, started to tear up, and started to walk away. I told her I wasn't frustrated about the conversation but now I'm frustrated bc she's doing the thing. She said it hurts her heart too much to see me look so frustrated. I'm like ??? tf I was literally processing. I told her if she keeps walking away from me mid conversation like this I know myself and I'm gonna eventually stop having conversations with her at all bc I will be too anxious that I'll upset her and I know my anxiety will tell me things like 'she doesn't care about what we have to contribute. She doesn't care about my thoughts and feelings.' and that's going to ruin any communication we have. We start arguing bc now she's saying I'm calling her crazy bc I'm saying she's misinterpreting my facial expressions and storms off. I shut the bedroom door and make myself a little pillow nest in the corner of the bed to try to destress and not cry. ( Our bed is in the corner against the wall bc it's comforting for me to be able to lean fully against the wall surrounded by pillows and blankets). Not 5 minutes goes by and she comes back to the bedroom. I hear her and before she opens the door I let her know ""I don't want to talk to you right now. I want to be alone please."" She comes in anyway. I say again ""I don't want to talk to you, I want to be alone."" She approaches me. ""I want to be alone. I want to be alone."" I'm curled up in the corner repeating myself. She starts talking over me about how she's going to sit and allow me to speak without interrupting me and sits on the edge of the bed. I shut down, turn away from her and pull a blanket over me. She set an alarm for 5 minutes and sat close to me in silence waiting. I'm getting sweaty, my heart is racing, I'm trying so hard not to cry. The alarm goes off, she gets up, says I love you and leaves.

?????

I don't know how to feel about this. I don't know how to process this. I'm feeling confused and violated and definitely far from loved. What am I supposed to do in this situation? How am I supposed to react or respond?",2025-01-25 19:43:55,2025-03-17 03:31:14,help
1iwm6xt,I know what i need to do but I need help and support,GoodTrip3606,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iwm6xt/i_know_what_i_need_to_do_but_i_need_help_and/,"I (29F) have been with my bf (33M) for a year and a half now. Everything between us is great on a day to day basis. He moved in with me about a year ago and he's always been sweet and helpful, he's great with my dog and he always does everything he can to help me and make me happy.

However he has mental issues and when he drinks sometimes he turns into a total monster and becomes someone i despise. He has rage fits and I hate that person. It has happened 4 times now in the time we've been together. The first time he got upset ( i dont remember what caused it) and tried to drive away when he was wasted and being a dummy and I tried to stop him but he ended up dragging me out of his car and I had a searingly painful road rash on my lower back from him dragging me away. 
The second time he went on a rampage because it was the anniversary of his mom dying and he was dealing with overhlwhelming emotions. He ended up destroying things that mostly belonged to him but he also broke an heirloom of mine and broke my bedroom door and my front door is cracked because it's made of glass and he kicked it. he promised to fix them but due to lack of money they  havnt been fixed in almost a year. I called the cops that night but he was asleep by the time they got there and they couldn't arrest him or anything. I got a call from the district attorneys office and told them to please not charge him because it was still new to me and I felt like it's a one off thing and I didn't want his life and my life to be harder than it already was. 

The third time I honestly don't even remember the details. But this past Friday was the fourth time and what happened was we were having fun with a couple of our dude friends at our house. The breaking point was when one of them lightly touched my butt and I made a joke being like ""babe he touched my butt hahaha"" and that made him lose it. He got out of control and the friend also got ready to fight him. I was holding my bf from the back of his pants to keep them away from each other while they were screaming at each other. The other friend who was also trying to diffuse was more near the other guy trying to hold him back. He, let's say is jake, finally was able to get, let's call him Sam, out of the house. But my bf was screaming and trying to chase both of them even though they were already leaving. I was still trying to calm my bf down even though I know now I should have just left as well. Well he ended up grabbing me by my head and screaming in my ear I don't even remember what he was saying but i couldn't break free I just kinda went limp and waited for it to stop, and then he went for the door and my dumb ass went to stop him again because I just didn't want any more turmoil with our friends but he ended up grabbing me by my face and almost took my eye and next thing I know I'm laying in a bush cuz he threw me. At some point he came back in the house and I told him he needs to leave. But he pulled the whole I pay rent here thing so I told him I'm going to get my neighbor who knows our situation and has told me to get him if I ever need him, so I told my bf I'm getting the neighbor. I left and immediately woke my neighbor when we got back to my house my bf was already outside with some extra clothes and said ""I'm leaving "". My neighbor stayed with me the whole night and next day to make sure I was okay. 
It feels good to get all this wrote down and have other people know I guess. But my point is I need support making a really difficult decision. I still feel the same as the last times it happened where I want to forgive him and work on things. But last time it happened I told him it would be that last time I tolerated that shit and I'm having internal issues getting the ability to stick to that. 

Like I said 99 percent of the time things are great, but add alcohol to him it's a huge risk and he sometimes comes home like that. I need help finding the strength. 

I wish I could articulate everything better but I did my best. Let me know if anything doesn't make sense. I think I know what everyone will tell me, I just need to hear it many times, hense why I'm posting this. Thank you if you made it this far.

Tldr: my bf can't control his rage when he's drunk. Is awesome when he doesn't, but still chooses to drink at times when he knows what it can lead to. I told him last time was the last I'd tolerate it and here we are again. I need support in finding the strength to do what I should do, which is either giving him a full stop ultimatum or just ending it all together. ",2025-02-23 22:16:49,2025-03-17 03:31:15,help

I know that she was being mentally abused and put into some extreme situations by her spouse, she was working on all of that.

She has contact with her mom whom lives near to her.

He is a stupid ""TRAD"" eg traditional husband. He expects her to pop out babies and forgo her studies to stay at home and do everything.

He won't let her go out alone unless it's to work.

We are currently having to wait for safe msg's to be sent to myself or another BF of hers. I think she is currently trying to find a way to communicate with her mom (that's what it sounds like).

I am considering sending her a burner phone with minutes to her school in attention to her.

Can anyone please direct me to proper programs and help in SC for situations like this?

Also, is the burner phone a good idea or is it dangerous to introduce that into the situation?

Please help with any type of assistance and ideas.

Please no stories unless they come with possible solutions.

1iv559u,"I think my sister's husband may be emotionally abusive, and I don't know how to help her.",LemonZest-Shark,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iv559u/i_think_my_sisters_husband_may_be_emotionally/,"Hello, I have really been struggling with this situation for a while, and I would really appreciate any advice I can get.

My younger sister Jane(22F) has been married to her husband Will(22M) for two years, they dated for under a year before they were engaged. We met Will in late 2020, and he became a part of Jane and my close friend group. I initially found connecting with Will difficult as he seemed to be very guarded. But over time he bonded with the friend group, and I would say we became genuine friends. After several months of friendship, I could tell he and Jane seemed to be interested in one another. The longer Will was interested in Jane the more she seemed to distance herself from friends. We would hang out as a group, and the entire time Will and Jane would be in a different room, only talking to each other, or leave to sit and talk in Wills car alone. I know that two people who are interested in each other, especially when you are that young, are going to hyper focus on one another. But this was so different from my sister's typical demeanor. She was outgoing and loved hosting and creating warm and friendly environments. Others from the friend group started expressing their hurt feeling over being ignored by Jane. Then Jane and Will became official, and I saw Will really try to bond with me and my parents. It seemed that they both turned a corner when they became official, and Will really tried to win my parents over. Will and Jane got engaged after less than a year with my parents blessing. Thats when I really started to notice a difference, a bunch of little things, but all added together it seems suspicious in hindsight. They both really pulled away from the family and from friends after the engagement. I had to have confrontations and discussion with them because I caught them partaking in spreading rumors about me and my fiancé. Jane was crying constantly, Will seemed to be angry when she talked with our mom about wedding plans, Will had to approve every wedding decision down to the color of the plates at the reception. Jane had to talk with Will on every work break, Janes weight fluctuated drastically, and her clothing style changed. She had a more feminine flowing style, wearing pastels, floral prints and cardigans. She suddenly changed to wearing a lot more leather, dark tones, and generally dressed more revealing. I want to be clear, I believe women can wear whatever they want, I have no issue with the clothes, it's the rapid change in style to match what Wills desire was. The wedding came and went, and Janes relationship with our parents has continued to disintegrate. Will has barraged our mom, accusing her of being a bad mom, of not caring for Jane, any many hurtful things in the same vein. Jane went from my best friend and closest confidant to us being no contact. Jane will pop into our parent's place to pick up something, and Will sits in the car honking his horn and texting her to leave. This is not a one off, Will does this every time my sister tries to have a conversation with our parents.

Just one of these things is not enough to be concerned. But looking back over the last four years, my sister is a completely different person; she was tight with her family, was bubbly and sweet, and we were best friends. She used to have a thriving friend group, and now only speaks to Wills family. And Will has only seemed to get more controlling and self-centered as time goes on. The main problem is that Jane is obsessed with him, she has this vision that they are the best most healthy couple. It's like when she said, 'I do', Will transplanted his brain into her head and now she is a puppet. My question reddit is this: How do I support my sister who thinks I am against her in every way, and how do I know if she is safe?

Edit: I forgot to add that Jane used to have her own thriving business. Will constantly encouraged her to shrink and limit her customers and time invested in her business till she quit. And now is 100% financially dependent on Will.",2025-02-21 23:34:35,2025-03-17 03:31:18,help

For five years I have been with someone I absolutely hate in the very beginning I saw the red flags and should have known something was wrong when we met I was not yet in recovery and I was using substances heavily but a year or two into the relationship I Got sober and have been since however, she has not. Every time I have tried To leave she has threatened to contact my family, my place of employment and other important people in my life and tell them I’m using or make Up anything that will destroy my reputation with those people

She was already extremely abusive, constantly put her hands on me told me I couldn’t leave constantly accused me of cheating tells me I cannot leave the house and has multiple cameras pointed out the bed and my side of the room and I mean four or five that I know of. Probably about a year ago her dad killed himself, and she went back into activation, and my life has been absolute hell since. and last week I walked downstairs and she was strangling her grandmother who is about 70 years old and is afraid to call the police, but will allow me to because she will go to jail for assault, which she very plainly should have to. I am trying to leave my family is now involved, but the only reason I’m finding difficulty is she has recordings from the old simple years ago where I pushed her just once because. When I was trying to leave, she blocked the door, and after several attempts to get out of the house and being chased, I said fuck it and pushed her out of the way so I can make my way out of the house. It’s extremely toxic environment and it gets red hot real quick. I don’t know what to do. I’m afraid that even if I go report it, she will show them the video from years ago and I will somehow get in trouble I don’t know what to do I don’t want to lose my job. I don’t want my family to be wary of me and I don’t want to get a stupid fucking charge from pushing someone who deserves much worse I would say, and every time I’ve tried to accept the relationship easily and smoothly. I’m always told I can’t like I’m a material possession, and then I am threatened with a world of different things. I told her grandmother she needs to make a report and she refuses she doesn’t want her granddaughter to get in trouble, but also told me in confidence that it wasn’t the first time she put her hands on her and out of all the times she has put her hands on me I’m not surprised, I don’t know what to do. I need help. All I want to do is leave and go live with my family.

My issues with leaving are I have 2 toddlers, haven't worked in over 5 years and can't even work in my degree field anymore, have no income or savings for myself so have no money for an apartment on my own, etc. He said the DV Shelter/Organization might have connections and info on lawyers who work with DV victims on sliding scale and specialize in child custody issues with DV (he's never hurt the kids, but we all know it's just a matter of time), and that they might be able to help me find a job and an apartment.

I feel like they probably won't be able to help in most of these areas. He said what harm does it do to call and ask. I know it doesn't hurt to ask but I guess I'm scared to find out they can't help me or they'll tell me that what I'm experiencing isnt that bad compared to others (and it's not, but hearing someone say that well would just kill my little bit of resolve to leave the relationship). It doesn't help that it's a military town and my husband is a high ranking officer. So the second someone finds that out about me I feel like the perception is ""You are an officer's wife, you have money and resources most couldn't dream of, you don't need our help"". I've experienced that a little at my current post, my advocate constantly makes assumptions about me and my safety plan and my life because I am an officer's wife, and I have a college degree and dress nicely.

I've also refused to involve the police and it seems most places expect you to do that if you really want help. I've read reviews of the DV shelter/organization and it's very mixed. It very much sounds like if they deem you worthy to help they do everything they can to help you and if not you're SOL. I also don't know if they'll even talk to me at all since I don't live there yet. Surely I can't be the first person who wants to leave a DV situation after a planned move and wants info before arriving there??

Upset, she asked me why I didn't clean, and I said because I forgot. Then she asked me, ""Oh, and what did you do at home today? Just did the dishes, right!?"" and I replied, ""I did the dishes, cleaned the cat's litter box, and worked on university stuff"", to which she responded, ""Oh, don't tell me"" in a completely dismissive tone. She continued to complain while I was cooking rice with headphones on, but one ear was uncovered so I could hear her. She didn't like that I ignored her and lost it. She yanked the headphones off my head and hit me with them on the head, and I yelled, ""You stupid, you hit me on the head!"" because it hurt a lot, as the headphones are still heavy, to which she shouted back, ""Shut up before you get hit!"" and called me a ""fucking bitch"" and yelled at me to leave the kitchen because, according to her, I don't know how to do anything right. I left and slammed the kitchen door hard. 

I am now sitting in my room and don't know what to do. This whole situation seems ridiculous and surreal. Unfortunately, this is not the first time such things have happened; as far back as I can remember, she has always been like this. She loses it over trivial things and thinks she can say and do whatever she wants. This behaviour extends to my father and grandfather who live in the house. Although my mother doesn't physically harm them, she hurts them with harsh words and insults over minor things that didn't even require such reactions. I think she has anger issues or maybe even a personality disorder, but I don't think it's an excuse for her actions. 

Today was the last straw, and I can't stand living here anymore. I won't tolerate her disrespect anymore and want to move out of this house. 

About two months ago, I had a big argument with my mother for similar reasons, and I almost left home. I was going to move into a shared apartment with university students in my city. I already had the key and everything, but when my mother saw that I was serious and saw me packing, she immediately regretted acting foolishly and started crying, begging me to stay living at home with her. I thought that situation from two months ago made her realize that she needed to change her behaviour, but apparently not. 

The problem is, at the moment, I only have 93€ in my bank account. I would have to work part-time the entire month of December to have enough money to rent a room in an apartment or house with other university students. However, I really don't want to live in this house, walking on ""eggshells"" for another month. Therefore, I have been thinking about asking the bank for a 500€ loan. However, I don't know if the bank will grant me a 500€ loan with a part-time contract. 

If you could give me advice, I would be immensely grateful.",2023-11-26 02:06:13,2025-03-17 03:33:19,domestic violence

10n2hw9,Hi I need help figuring out if I’ve been a victim of abuse… (DV=domestic violence),AlexandertheMeh_,5,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/10n2hw9/hi_i_need_help_figuring_out_if_ive_been_a_victim/,"Hi. Writing this is so hard but I want an opinion on this because I need to know how to move forward. So I was taking with my friends about somethings that my now ex boyfriend did and they were horrified, although to me I knew it wasn’t good but I didn’t think it was that bad.

So the most glaring thing is that sometimes when I was being annoying he’d slap me in the face. I’d beg him to be quieter sometimes because I was worried someone else would hear, he’d only hit me harder. But I mean he never hit me in anger, granted I usually apologized and caved before he ever got angry with me, I tried to hard to be a good boyfriend and not make him upset. Is this normal or just something small that I shouldn’t be upset about? Even posting in here makes me feel so guilty for even thinking it could be something bad that he could be bad. I know it’s not fair to him for me to ask but my friends I’ve told about it called it dv and just idk. He did a lot of other stuff that they also called that but none of it was physical and I was probably remembering wrong or exaggerating anyways. Which I feel really bad about because they know him, or at least used to and I don’t want to speak poorly of him when it’s probably just my imagination. 

But um is that something that would be considered DV? Thank you so much any comments are really greatly appreciated",2023-01-28 01:33:45,2025-03-17 03:33:24,domestic violence

I am in an abusive relationship.,WorthyByrd,38,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/x4esvz/just_got_off_the_phone_with_the_national_domestic/,"I don't know how many people have to tell me, including everyone on here, but this phone conversation I just had - something clicked.

I am in an abusive relationship. There are feelings that everyone feel, and then there is behaviour that people CHOOSE, yes choose to engage in. 

There is no such thing as mutual abuse. It is a myth. That's what the person at the hotline said, because I was questioning myself.

I started it, I pushed her to this point, maybe I was abusive first. 

Lots of feelings right now. Guilt, for leaving her because she's been there for me through my rough days. Shame, for even being in the position I'm in now. Sadness, anger, confusion, grief. All of them.

I am in an abusive relationship. It is not my fault. I will be okay. I don't owe her anything. I will take accountability for my actions and words. I know I did wrong too. This will be hard but worth it. 

Continue working on me. Do not give in and go to couples counselling with her, it will not help.

I don't know what this is, I just had to write it out. This is just part of my journey now, it won't be my forever. 

I hope anyone reading this is okay today, and safe.",2022-09-02 22:48:29,2025-03-17 03:33:25,domestic violence

He says its fake and he didn't do anything wrong. Just now he threatened me in the car and terrorized me, he's been non stop calling me awful names and telling me im worthless and stupid and if i get upset he asks me why im upset while he's cornering me and saying his famous words 'i'm getting angry' which means hes warning me hes going to hit me.

i have panic attacks and constant fear, fight, and flight responses to him that i cannot control. tonight i said that unless he stops im leaving and he basically disowned our baby daughter and said pack her shit and leave.

now hes saying hes sorry and he wants intervention and conseling after refusing before. its really just more for my sanity that a neutral third professional party hears and sees this and amkes me feel like im not everything he says i am and i dont deserve this and im not worthless. i lie to my family, his family, his treatment/legal program, his friends and he tells people hes this amazing fatherhood hero so its humiliating and i want him to hear from a professional what this level of abuse does to people.

he doesnt believe it was serious or affected me and says i play the victim and need to get over it and grow up.

is there some online intervention session we can do where this can be explained to a third party and he can hear it from them that what hes doing is wrong and damaging?",2023-07-18 22:19:05,2025-03-17 03:33:26,domestic violence

After I watched it, I wrote this. I am hoping to create a little bit of a ripple effect here. Because who here feels like their experience isolated them more than they ever have been in their entire life? Even after the wreckage, it’s just like floating around as a ghost. Especially if it was physical. Or even if it wasn’t. And especially if you’re a lone parent from it. Or even if you’re not. 

If you’re in it, or healing from it, or on the other side… this is a piece of it that made me feel more alone, someone being interested in you after the dust settles. Until I switched my mindset to this. So, I hope this helps you. Because, damn it, we deserve to never feel alone with ourselves ever again.

13wd6qj,Is this domestic violence?,Any_Carrot2469,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/13wd6qj/is_this_domestic_violence/,"Background: Husband (40M) and I (33F) have been together 14 years (married 8) and have a child under 2 years old. It feels silly to ask this question but I feel like because he hasn’t physically hit me that it’s not technically abuse. I also feel stupid because I brought our child into this but I thought all of this was in the past. I was brought up with an abusive step parent and the last thing I want in this world is for my child to grow up in an abusive environment. I suffer from PTSD, depression, anxiety, and anorexia as a direct result of my traumatic upbringing and have a regular therapist and psychiatrist and also take medication. My husband has never been even remotely abusive to our child. 

Story: my husband suffers from terrible anger issues that he has had from day 1 of our relationship. It mostly flares up with his drinking. He is otherwise a very intelligent person who has taken on majority of the childcare (I went back to work) and does most of the cooking/cleaning. He is a progressive person (I am probably trying to justify his behaviour already). 

Prior to our child being born we had big fights infrequently (once every couple months) that were usually after he was drinking too much. Usually during these fights he rants about stuff like me not helping out enough around the house, but most of the time he talked in circles and seemed to just want to argue. I would be called a fucking cunt or bitch constantly during these arguments. These fights have occurred more frequently (once/week) since our child was born and many times do not involve alcohol. 

In terms of violence, in the past he has grabbed both my upper arms and squeezed them as hard as he could and it left bruises on both my arms that I had to hide for a week (I still have photos). He did this while drunk because I wouldn’t get up from sitting on a step and follow him home from a restaurant. He was angry in this scenario because there was a liquor store nearby that was on my google maps that said it was “open” but when we got there it was closed. He blamed it being closed on me and got angry at me. He regularly blames me for things that are not my fault and will get angry if I make mistakes or have any sort of accident. He gets road rage and has swerved on a road saying he’s going to crash the car because he was so angry with me. He has lifted our couch up and almost dropped it on our cat during an angry drunk episode. He has hit and punched numerous items around our house when angry (he has put a hole in a wall at his workplace after hours when drinking and he got angry). He has thrown things at me (clothes hangers and food). He has grabbed my arms and shaken me many years ago. More recently I didn’t want to go to the gym so he grabbed both my wrists hard and pulled me from the couch while I was fighting to get away from him and yelling at him to let go - just so that I would stop being “lazy” (I was 6 months post partum and just got home from work) - he was sober during this incident. He recently also has grabbed my phone from my hands forcefully hurting my hands by bending my fingers back because I was videoing him during these scenarios as I was scared he would hurt me. He has forcefully grabbed my phone from me many times when drunk and threatened to break it or take it. Recently he threatened to throw our baby bassinet through the window if I took my son to my moms (I didn’t feel safe at home and wanted to leave with my son). He then got really close to me and said in a threatening voice “don’t do this” so I stayed home as I was scared he was going to hurt me and break things. He has also forcefully grabbed our child from me while I struggled and yelled “no” while he was drunk because he didn’t want me to “take him away” from him. I have this video recorded. He is usually always yelling at me when he’s drinking and likes to minimize me and break down my self confidence and self worth. He can talk for an hour about what a “piece of shit” I am and the reasons why. He will stand right up against me blocking my path when I am trying to argue my position as if he’s trying to intimidate me. He has also threatened suicide multiple times (including since our child was born) when I say I don’t want to be in this relationship. He has gone as far to bring a straight razor into a full bathtub with his clothes on and lock the door. He has also opened our patio door (we live in a high level suite) and looked over the edge as if implying to jump. He is constantly gaslighting me trying to say I said certain things or did certain things that I didn’t just to make him look better or make his story make sense.",2023-05-31 05:19:03,2025-03-17 03:33:28,domestic violence

Since the beginning of the relationship he has been lying about going to the bars. He's also been caught doing stupid things on Snapchat and Facebook. He an on the road worker. I relocated to a few states away, away from friends and family. I started to notice he had a pattern of going to his hometown and then the bar. He wouldn't answer my calls and when he did he was a complete asshole. We have had a few instances where I've gotten really upset bc he continues to lie to me. I am new in a new town and I am sitting at home trying to be a ""good girl"" while he's at home getting shitfaced. Last weekend we were back in his hometown and I noticed there was a bunch of booze drank. He told me he didn't drink at all the prior weekend and that he only went into the bar to cash a check. Then when I saw the bottle I confronted him he blamed his buddy for drinking it. He always gets really defensive and will double down on his lies. I said I don't believe that your buddy drank it and that you happened to be in the bar. I probably wouldn't care if you went to the bar occasionally but you keep lying and then you try to prove your not lying by staring me straight in the eyes. He's been crazymaking the whole time we've been together. This time we got into a actual physical fight. He choked me out and his kids were home and the 14yo called the cops and he got hauled off to jail. I spoke to the DA and said that he's not normally abusive so they are willing to put him on a deferred sentence. He was upset that wasn't good enough. Then he started to lie about the whole situation saying ""I never choked you"" in most states that is a felony. I told him he should be grateful he's getting it deferred for LIKE offenses, so just don't do anything stupid for a year. I got upset eventually bc he was twisting everything and just lying to himself about the situation like he's trying to make it real in his head that he didn't do anything. I feel insane myself anymore. I've been thinking about going to Al-Anon, I have a therapy appointment tomorrow. I guess I just needed to talk it out here.",2023-05-02 17:47:38,2025-03-17 03:33:32,domestic violence

But they are still violence. 

The purpose is to cause fear and intimidation by aggressive displays of their physical dominance or control over your physical safety. 

And when one person is willing to participate in violence and the other is not, that gives them power. They are willing to get that power through fear. 

These may include:

- Driving recklessly with me in the car 
- Throwing objects close to or towards me 
- Smashing or breaking property close to me where glass or wood splinters are flying 
- Continuing aggressive and intimidating  behaviour when they can see I am in a state of physical distress from the stress of their abuse i.e. having cardiac symptoms from stress, and they do not stop, they keep going. This puts my health and safety at risk.  

Another abusive act that my abuser does is harm themselves through destruction of property by punching walls or slamming furniture etc. 

This is still using aggression and fear for power because 

1) Then my entire focus shifts off of their abusive behaviour to if they are they okay and I have to tend to their injuries 

2) I am then left to always be mitigating every situation out of not only fear that they will cause me harm but also cause themselves harm, and I don’t ever know what they are going to do or how far they are going to take that. 

I just don’t see these forms of domestic violence and their intentions discussed so often.

Need advice.,Leather_Spring_544,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/xcy3yw/i_was_the_victim_of_domestic_violence_i_have_a/,"I have been in a relationship for more than a year. In this relationship I suffered physical, emotional and financial abuse. I couldn't bring myself to file a formal charges of the abuse because I was still in love with the abuser. Now months have passed since I was granted a restraining order and my feelings have changed.

I maybe love myself more because I realize how cruel it was for someone to have had such a great level of disrespect to do everything this person has done to me. It was humiliating and emotionally and physically damaging. I have a scar from a time of abuse, I was stolen which amounts to thousands of dollars and I can't stop thinking about going and pressing charges of all the threats, of the times physical abuse happened and everything.

I am a Christian and now I am much closer to God and it feels wrong to go and press charges. I know how much everyone preaches about forgiveness but it still hurts when I think how I could let someone treat me that way. It damages my self - esteem and makes me feel like nothing when someone could have had such a great level of disrespect to me. The stealing, the violence, the threats, the stalking. I also feel like I should let the authorities know everything that has happened, at least to have more protection in the future if anything where to happen.

I believe my boyfriend is mentally and emotionally abusive. 

He is hypercritical. Tells me I am raising my children wrong, and they will stay ""babies"" and ""dependent on me."" He yells at me, putting me down, telling me I can't manage my money. He frequently gets super annoyed with me for being ""lazy"" because I didn't run the roomba, mop the floors, clean the bathroom and otherwise engage my time productively. Instead, I played games on my phone and watched TV WHEN I wasn't taking care of/shuttling my children around to counseling, occupational therapy, soccer practice, etc. 

I don't work BECAUSE OF my 2 special needs children. One of children only goes to school right now until 11:30a. Plus they have all the above appts. I, too, have lots of appts. bc I have mental and physical health issues. 

He will give me a hard time about those, too, telling me I need to lose weight, that I need to take better care of myself. 

My boyfriend has a history of DV. He had to take anger management and DV classes 7 years ago when his son was removed by CPS/DCFS. He failed to reunify bc of his issues despite finishing the classes. 

His son's mom reunified; however she committed suicide last September and now my boyfriend is trying to reunify with his son a second time. It's added a lot of stress. 

I thought I wasn't a victim of DV because he wasn't hitting me...the way he did his previous baby moms. As far as I know, he's had no physical DV in 7 years. I thought he'd had none.

This happened last night. I'm a domestic violence survivor so I take this very seriously but i am also very understanding/sympathetic to the victims perspective. Last night I ubered back to the hotel very intoxicated. I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and heard someone out on the lawn of the hotel yelling so I walked closer and realised there was a woman yelling ""get your fucking hands off me"" and she was fighting with her boy friend. There was another man outside who walked up at the same time and and he and I basically just started yelling at the guy and he stopped and walked away and the woman walked to me. The other guy who intervened walked away and the girl and I went to the pool to talk. She made excuses that he doesnt drink often and only gets this way when he drinks. She made some more excuses and just maintained that she loved him more than anything and that she'll punch him right back, she was very fit and said she could take care of herself. But we all know those are just excuses. She and I sat together for about an hour talking, first about the situation and then just about anything.

My close friend is in an extremely abusive relationship. Her boyfriend has purposely put her in debt with her apartment complex by not paying his half of then rent when he is mad, he is not in the lease and claims he has squatters rights. Now she’s swimming in debt and late fees to the apartment. She is now pregnant and having high risk pregnancy with a heart condition that keeps her from working. The police here in Florida won’t help her because she hasn’t changed her tags and license over from her home state, and told her if she called them again they would take her to jail even though they arrived to her having a bloody nose and bruising to her face. They did not take him to jail. He takes her apartment key when he leaves so she can’t leave or she won’t be able to get back into her home. He calls her names everyday and has told her she should have an abortion on multiple occasions. He’s gone as far as threatening to hire someone to kill her. She needs help as he has cut her off from all resources and family help. He refuses to leave her apartment and threatens legal action against her if she tries to lock him out. Any suggestions or resources are greatly appreciated.",2021-10-02 15:24:04,2025-03-17 03:33:47,domestic violence

My husband raped me be a few times during our over a decade long marriage. All were while I was awake, however, one time I'm very certain was after him drugging me. I woke up hours later than usual, wearing pajamas I don't wear to bed, sore and covered in cum. I freaked out and asked him what happened and threatened to move out. He wouldn't acknowledge anything, said he wouldn't even know where to get such drugs, and couldn't bother to look away from his phone. He was annoyed I slept so long. The sleep was much later for me than normal. I went to the bathroom afterwards to shower and choose to believe him instead of uproot our lives.  We've been separated for almost a year now and this memory hit me so hard. I'm worried that he did it more than once, especially since he admitted to recording me sexually without my knowledge in the past.

s3m1yl,Domestic violence?,i_cant_zombie,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/s3m1yl/domestic_violence/,"My husband and I have been married for 9 years and have a 6 year old - T. We both had physical and mental health issues before we met and those things have always been a part of our relationship.

Over the few years my husband’s anger and depression have gotten worse. It was greatly impacting all of us and I reached a breaking point and asked him to move out for a while so he could focus on his health. And so our son and I could have a more predictable routine and less drama. So, he went to stay at his parent’s house just after Christmas.

Since he moved out, he has spent time with our son T and T loves spending time with his dad. But on the two occasions when all 3 of us spent time together at our home, he had major angry outbursts including punching a take out container and sending food flying, breaking a plastic storage box, throwing toys, punching cabinets etc and screaming. 

In both cases, I took our T upstairs and waited for my husband to calm down and then I asked him to leave. He refused to leave. I wanted to latch the interior lock on the door and go to bed, but he wouldn’t go. I talked about how we needed this to be a safe/stable space for T and this behavior was not ok around me or our son. He eventually left, but on his terms.

My individual therapist characterized this behavior as a form of domestic violence. I was surprised to hear that term associated with this and I’m overwhelmed by it.

When my husband and I talked about these episodes, he minimized them, said his behavior wasn’t that big of a deal and that if I was so upset by it maybe I needed more mental health support and that maybe he should live here with our son so I could take care of my needs. 

So basically my therapist is on one end of the spectrum in her classification of this and he is on the other. 

Am I overreacting? Is my therapist’s opinion on this too extreme?",2022-01-14 07:01:54,2025-03-17 03:33:53,domestic violence

Angel Flight and Mercy Flight offer free flights to victims of domestic abuse. Here's the list of websites by region: https://aircharitynetwork.org/request-a-flight/

Also, consider calling your local crisis center and asking about a grant for your transportation. They may be able to pay for a ticket.

Lastly, Uber has a program called Driving Change and they will give free rides to domestic violence victims. Just call your local shelter and ask for a voucher. If they participate in the program they will give you a voucher/code for a free ride.

qpy95e,my parents are in a toxic relationship. i think my dad has been abusive and i want my mom to leave. TW: domestic violence,Alarmed_Nobody_9259,13,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/qpy95e/my_parents_are_in_a_toxic_relationship_i_think_my/,"hey so i’ve been trying to deal with this for a while but i just can’t decide what to do by myself and i have no one to turn to, so i’m here to ask for help. i’m sorry if this is too long to read, but a lot of things are unclear to me and i really don’t know what to do.

i’m 17 and the oldest of 5 kids. my parents are married and usually never fight, so i’ve always admired their relationship. about two months ago my mom asked me to help her delete some stuff off her phone as she was running out of storage. when I unlocked the phone, this email account was open and all messages had dates as subjects. I never should’ve clicked on them but I just did. every single email had several attachments, screenshots of different conversations between my dad and other women. most of them where he was clearly flirting with them, others where they talked trash about my mom saying she “is always with the kids” and “always complains”, and even some sexting conversations that I thankfully did not open.

anyway, i had about three weeks where all i could think about were those emails and i cried almost every single day. about a month ago, my mom bought a new phone and she asked me to help her clear her notes and files so she could transfer the things she needed only. when cleaning her notes app i noticed that apart from the regular supermarket lists and stuff, she used them as a diary of some sort, where she wrote messages as if they were directed to my dad (the most recent ones from july-aug from this year).

basically she just wrote long descriptions of everything she found out, saying how she felt and even describing how tired she is of taking care of my siblings and i every single day and having to live by his empty promises of changing. i’m trying to make this as short as i can, but lets just say i also found out he got with one of his students when he was a teacher a few years ago, and had been consistently sending money to many of those women. other disgusting things were written and mentioned, but i really had it when i read that in one of the notes she said something along the lines of her not even realizing where he hit her. 

finding out my dad was this completely different person still feels like someone stabbed me. i feel so so bad for my mom and i just don’t know how to help her. one note specifically she wrote saying how she had been thinking about how she would manage with us 5 by herself. and another one saying how she stays with him because he promised her to change, and how she is afraid to leave him, because she loves him, because all income comes from him, and because he has a really good reputation around town.

i keep thinking about the way i always looked up to him and how he turned out to be this way. it really hurts when i think about how i like the music i like because he likes it, i like cars because he does, i watch and talk sports with him, and i’ve always taken pride in calling him my father. and it feels wrong to be worrying about what i feel when my mom has been through all of this. i don’t feel safe here anymore, i can barely sleep at night knowing what he’s done and worrying for my mom. i worry for my siblings and i want to keep them away from this so bad.

i’m so sorry this post is such a mess but i just can’t do it anymore, i’ve wanted to talked to my mom about it because that seems to be my only option, but her mom (my grandma) has been struggling with health issues and we think she may pass soon, so i don’t feel it’s the right moment to tell her, she is stressed enough and me telling her i know all of this will only worry her more. i don’t have any other option because talking to anyone i know means they know my dad, and i don’t feel it’s appropriate to talk about anything before i talk about it with my mom, after all she’s been keeping it a secret for years apparently. i fully respect what my mom wants, but i would want her to leave my dad, and even if i do get that its hard because she loves him more than anything, i feel she is putting not only herself but me and my siblings in danger by staying. i feel it’s also important to mention that my dad is a heavy drinker and while he doesn’t drink that much daily, he has had some specific moments where it has been an issue.

i’ve thought about it ever since i found out and decided that i will do whatever it takes to keep my siblings safe, even if it means i’ll eventually have to move out and have them live with me. also, doing anything about the situation would mean we have to discuss the “why” with them, and i don’t know if i want them to know what kind of person my dad really is. it hurt enough when i found out and its not something i want them to go through.

ps. I want to add that on my sister’s birthday this year a few months ago (april i think) she had a party, and when all her friends were leaving I heard my parents fighting. the yelling was pretty loud and they usually never fight (and if they do they never yell like that), my sister had to ask her friends to go on a walk around the neighborhood with her so they didn’t hear the fight and their yelling eventually ended on what I thought was a loud thud noise against some furniture. i asked my mom about it some time later that month but she said nothing happened. obviously after all of this i can only assume he hit her, but i’m not sure if this is what she was talking about in that note or if he’s done it again.

another ps. sorry for any mistakes, english is not my first language.",2021-11-09 07:11:12,2025-03-17 03:33:57,domestic violence

In fact he already tried to hold me down once. I'm disabled and I'm worried that if I stay there he's going to end up raping me because I can't fight him off. He's basically said let it happen because I'm not hurting you.

I know it's going to sound like I'm being entitled but he flips on the lights and the TV in the middle of the night and I can't sleep. I've already applied for disability but that's the process and I've applied for housing but none of the places are taking applications due to covid and they said that even when they do open back up which they don't even know when that will be, there's a six-month wait. I just can't live this way anymore. I didn't leave my abuser just to have to deal with this so I would honestly rather just being a tent.

I've already called The Domestic Violence Shelter here and they are full to capacity.

lnxygi,Domestic Violence Survivor - Best Friend Currently Dating an Abuser - Advice please,diff4544,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/lnxygi/domestic_violence_survivor_best_friend_currently/,"Hey everyone!

Ive been a long time reader - first time poster. I really need an opinion from people i dont know about my current situation.

My friend and I have known each other for about 5 years. We have been inseparable (not necessarily in the sense of seeing each other every day etc) but we were very close emotionally and mentally. We could tell each other anything etc.

For background: i was in an incredibly violent domestic violence situation approx 6+ years ago, it lasted for about 5 years. It was extreme. There were a few times where my abuser almost killed me. I feared for my life when i was finally able to break away - and i had extreme PTSD and anxiety because of this relationship - which i received therapy for (still am in therapy and also on medication). My life has done a complete 180 - i am very healthy, happy, almost finished with my degree. im in a very healthy and loving relationship.

My friend a handful of months ago met this man and at first i was beyond excited and happy for her. Suddenly and very quickly things took a turn. It started very subtle - but as a domestic violence survivor - many of us can spot these signs quicker than most. He would say things to her like: you are so cute - i can see that the wheels are turning and no ones home its fun to watch. Now, most people wouldn't freak out over it nor did i, but i did warn her: this isnt something necessarily nice and maybe you should keep an eye on it. She stated she thought it was cute - okay, i disagree but moving on. She set up boundaries very respectfully and quickly with him: im not going to be ready for sex for x amount of time nothing to do with you this is just my thing etc. He went on to say: im really fucking offended that you would think that im just trying to fuck you. I explained: hes trying to guilt you into sex - dont ever apologize to someone for putting up a boundary for yourself. She apologized to him - said she didnt think hed take it personally. (I explained there was no reason for him to - she disagreed). She goes to his house for the first time approx date 3-4 they mess around she explains im not ready to go all the way - he asked her about 5 times to have sex with him - She kept having to say no - i stated it was unacceptable behavior and urged her to get a reality check - she said she essentially thinks its cute that hes so into her - and that he: ""has a chip on his shoulder but she finds it really sweet"" Basically, this man has forced her to have sex with him and that is a truth that she is not ready or willing to face.

\*\* Also have begun to notice: we are both college students - she has let her schooling slip severely to spend time with him which is a giant red flag to me - for example they went on a trip for valentines weekend - and she did none of her work which is very unlike her and now shes behind and struggling in her classes\*\*

The issue between us: she asked me for my opinion on this guy and i stated that i didnt like him at all, he gave me the creeps, i dont think hes a good person, i have a horrible feeling about him etc. Immediately she started to attack me, my boyfriend, my relationship etc. So it created a wedge between us and i met her to discuss it in person: dont ever disrespect me again; i will support you but i dont like him. She smiled and nodded and ever since there has been an extreme amount of tension and animosity most of which i could ignore until recently she started in with the topic of abusive relationships. Celebrity men being outed as abusers has been the topic of focus - a topic we once saw eye to eye on and now shes got this attitude of: i think its weird that you dont feel sorry for these men, i mean if they had a horrible childhood thats a good excuse to me for why they end up the way they did. etc. things to just really seemingly get under my skin and trigger me.

I have begun to get really triggered and have flashbacks about my abuse that took years of therapy for me to work through. I expressed this to her - and stated while i dont blame him; he is bringing out a part of her that is the worst part of her and ultimately SHE is doing these things to me and i need them to stop. She stated that she disagreed with everything i said, stuck up for him essentially (was not expecting her not to for the record) and when on to say: honestly, i forget half the time that youre a domestic violence survivor - my bad.

I really love her like a sister - we have been friends as i said for years and our children are growing up together (we each have a child) and im worried for her - i know that i cant control her life or decisions no matter how clearly i can see them and she cannot - but i can control my own life. I recognize that her behavior is toxic and triggering for me - but i cant help feel this sense of guilt for wanting to turn my back on her. I dont really want to do that at all. When i was with my abuser a lot of people did it to me and i did understand why and continue to but it hurt and it was a very lonely place to be. But for my own mental health - i cannot be in the presence of a man like this nor is it easy for me to watch my friend change for a man like this. I guess i wanted to share my story and see what you guys would do in this situation? Thank you in advance.",2021-02-20 03:20:33,2025-03-17 03:33:59,domestic violence

It’s been interrupting my day and my time that I spend with my bf. The other night I decided to block his number bc it has started to affect how I show up in my relationships. He’s been obsessively texting me to see if I’ve told anyone about what he did to me. It’s been two days since I’ve blocked his number... he reached out to my good friend and asked “how my tumor was doing” to seem like a nice guy... while also trying to slyly ask if I had said anything to her about what happened between us. It’s been very excessive. I’m planning on filing legal work because he will not stop, but I’m worried how far he’s going to take this in the meantime. My new bf and I have been dating for about two months. He knows a little bit about how crazy my ex was and how he’s still been contacting me... but I don’t think he knows how to deal with it.

heihef,Life after Domestic Violence,cafetero7,4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/heihef/life_after_domestic_violence/,"Hello all, I hope you have the time and patience to help me. I know when it comes to abusive relationships most people think of a man doing harm to a woman, which is unfortunately true. In my case it is the other way around. I wanted to get some advice on how those who have experienced mental/emotional/physical abuse have dealt with or moved forward from these experiences. What have you learned that has helped you? It would really help to hear from men who have gone through this, but advice from anyone would be very appreciated.

Just to give a backstory, I was in a toxic and abusive relationship for 2 1/2 years and am currently going through a divorce. We lived with each other for 7 months after the breakup, and it was a very unhealthy environment. My ex-wife was emotionally, mentally and physically abusive. She was a jealous person, would get me upset on purpose to get reactions out of me, had hit me multiple times on different occasions leaving me with bruises on my body, and has done many other things. I never hit her back or laid my hands on her and always made sure that I respected her physical being. She has falsely accused me of shoving her before I moved out and even threatened to call the cops on me. That was a devastating moment and felt betrayed. I didn’t even recognize her anymore. Now don’t get me wrong, I have made my mistakes. This was my first serious relationship and I blame myself for getting sucked into the cycle of emotional abuse because I thought I knew better. I let myself become emotionally and mentally abusive. There were times when I wasn’t considerate of her feelings and have said things to her that were disrespectful. I realize my mistakes and am working to make sure they don’t happen again. I still don’t think I deserved the kind of agonizing bullshit she put me through. How can someone say “you’re the love of my life” and “you’re the best man I’ve ever been with”, but yet treat you like crap? How can they call you a “monster” when you have always put them first? Of course there were good moments, but the bad outweighs the good. I’m sorry for rambling, I’m just trying to find myself again and learn more ways on how to deal with this trauma throughout my life. I am currently in therapy and it has helped a lot. But I feel like connecting with those who have experienced similar traumatic events will be just as helpful, if not more.",2020-06-23 17:06:00,2025-03-17 03:34:07,domestic violence

This is Angie. I knew Angie. She was sweet and kind. 

Her soon to be ex-husband Jimmie Ledbetter, Jr. **was an advocate for the prevention of domestic violence.** Jimmie had organized domestic violence meetings, where he also spoke. 

According to [this article](https://www.keloland.com/news/domestic-violence-survivor-shares-her-story/) from 2018, Jimmie Ledbetter of Sioux Falls had said:

*”I can’t stop it, but hopefully I can slow it down somehow by reaching just one person…”*

*”I would like to see the courts be stiffer when you see the abuse happen. Women are losing their faith with the courts,”* Ledbetter had said.

According to police reports, Angie had recently filed for divorce Jimmie on the grounds of irreconcilable differences, and cited extreme cruelty in her petition. 

Court documents say Ledbetter was the last person to see Angie alive. The Sioux Falls man has now been charged with homicide in the death of his wife.

Last Sunday, on October 27th, at about 2am, her soon-to be ex husband Jimmie showed up in Angie’s bedroom and scared her. 

Angie then changed the locks and the passcode to the garage. 

The next day, on Monday, October 28th, surveillance footage from her neighbors cameras showed her soon to-be-ex entering the home at 3:30pm. 

Screams were heard at 5:30pm. 

Jimmie Ledbetter was then seen exiting through the garage door at 5:45pm, leaving it open.

Previous calls had been dispatched to the same address.

Prior to his arrest, Jimmie Ledbetter had created a GoFundMe to raise money for burial services. Some of the posts on his FB page seem a bit more ominous in this context, now.

The timeline of events has me wondering if this was punishment for filing for divorce and speaking up.

What also stands out to me is how quickly this happened.

Even if Angie had filed for a protection order immediately first thing on Monday morning after Jimmie had showed up in her bedroom and scared her, it still might not have stopped her from being murdered. 

The act of ending it is *the* most dangerous time for those who are contemplating departing a domestic violence situation. I don’t know when Jimmie received those divorce papers but it seems things may have escalated in intensity with the finality of the situation in writing. 

*It can happen this fast. You just never know how much time you have left. There may have been a dozen fights before this one, there may have been two dozen attempts to leave.*

On his birthday, on his FB page he had stated: “Most men won't see age 85! Sad thing to think about but true. So get busy living or get busy dying! Make that special someone feel your immediate intentions. Have those meaningful talks with your children! Once your time has expired you can't rewind what God has set in motion. **So to Angie Ledbetter your going to get the best of what's left of me…**

That promise seems more ominous now that I am re-reading it again.

1i58try,My partner tried to kill me,Claire274,67,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1i58try/my_partner_tried_to_kill_me/,"This story is probably a year long. But the main part started in October when I first called the police. Me (f29) and him (m43) had a toxic habit of arguing after drinking. He would typically lock me in a room and take my phone. In October I changed my passcode and updated Siri. I used hey siri to call police in October when he started getting violent. He was scrambling to grab my phone so I was able to run to a neighbours

He broke bail 3x, had a dvpn (domestic violence protection notice) served and was found breaching that 3x

On new years I met with him at a hotel. He started getting verbally abusive again, telling me he couldn’t wait until the day I hung myself, how I would never have children because I’d ruined myself etc. I packed my bags and said I think it’s best if I leave for tonight. He blocked the door and started getting physically aggressive. I told him if he didn’t let me leave, I would scream. 
He didn’t let me leave. So I screamed. So he put both his hands around my neck and beat my head into the wall. I used my fists to pound on the wall so he had to take a hand off my neck to pin my hands down. So I tried screaming for help again. He shoved his entire arm down the back of my throat so I was gagging and choking, he told me it couldn’t be that bad because I used to be bullock so I should shut up and take it. 
He alternated between choking and covering my mouth for about half an hour. When he covered my mouth he also pinched my nose so I couldn’t breathe. He shoved his hand down my throat again and that time, his hand came out covered in blood. He tore my left tonsil in 2 pieces, I didn’t realise at the time but he did some serious damage to my throat and mouth. 
Eventually the hotel night manager, an assistant and security guard used a master key to get into the room and at that point he had me in the bed, one hand choking me and the other hand holding down both my wrists. He was surprised by the interruption and got off me, I grabbed my things and the manager took me to an admin office while the security guard stayed with him until police arrived

iof61y,In a domestic violence shelter but frustrated because they seem to pick and choose who to help and who they won't.,gothmommy13,6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/iof61y/in_a_domestic_violence_shelter_but_frustrated/,"I've been here for about 6 weeks which is the time frame they give you to get yourself together before your exit date. I've asked about an extension a couple of times and was told that it should be ok but that I need to be thinking about a job and apartment. I've been so busy with other stuff they've made me do I haven't had time. I also already work so it's like my advocate isn't paying attention. It's ultimately up to the director whether I get the extension or not and I have proof of what I've been doing but it's like they don't care.

I went and got the restraining order that they forced me to get which has now left me without the option of being able to go back to my ex's house if I had to for obvious reasons. I'm on a waiting list for housing since I'm low income and my son is on the waiting list for daycare and tbh I'm a little pissed because my advocate said they have a notary and she was gone the week that I had to get the restraining order then the next week she didn't have her stamp with her. I had to pay out of pocket for cabs to get back and forth and to pay to have the documents for the restraining order notorized after my advocate told me she would tell the people in the hotline room to approve it. They've always told me they can't. I also apparently qualify for relocation money but apparently your advocate is supposed to file for that and hasn't. 

I just feel like what was the point of me even coming here if they're just going to kick me out without giving me enough time even though they know some things have slowed down and even stopped due to Covid?! Yet there's some people here who have been here for 8 months or longer who do nothing but sit around all day doing nothing and don't even watch their kids. What am I supposed to do? I can't be on the streets with a baby! They should know as a domestic violence shelter that some people like me are starting completely over and 6 weeks isn't enough time. I feel like they could be better trained. No compassion whatsoever. I've told them some shelters aren't even taking in due to Covid which is the truth. Again, they don't care then they wonder why some victims return to their abusers.

I'm just really fed up because I'm not made of money and they know this. Also, they should know that a lot of victims come in with literally no money and no job because financial abuse is pretty common in abusive relationships. I just don't see how they think 6 weeks should be enough time especially in a pandemic. That's why I say it seems like they pick and choose who to help and who they basically tell we don't care, your time is up, get out. 

I'm a good resident. I don't cause trouble and I stay to myself. I've even shown my advocate proof that I'm working on bettering my situation and they're still acting like they want me out this week! I just don't see how they can show favoritism. I'm terrified of what will happen to me. I'll be forced to bring my son back to his father's house, also my abuser, because he lives with his parents. I'm not going to walk the streets with a baby. I'm just really pissed right now because I could see if I was sitting around on my ass not trying to get anything done but I've been running around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to get things done. This isn't right.

Edit: I got an extension and I have an appointment Monday to do an intake for rapid rehousing. It's good but I still feel like the original post is accurate. It seems like if things don't happen in their time frame, they treat you like you're not doing anything. I resented how they were like well you should've had all this done by now and acted like I was being lazy because it wasn't done when they wanted it to be. Having a child makes things harder and take longer and they should realize this.",2020-09-07 20:16:42,2025-03-17 03:34:12,domestic violence
c0ep1s,VENT: I think it's sad how some people think that men can't be victims of domestic violence. I just got into a debate with someone who tried to say that men cannot be victims and that the abuse against them is not as serious as the abuse against women.,Babyhandgrenade,13,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/c0ep1s/vent_i_think_its_sad_how_some_people_think_that/,"I know I shouldn't have gotten as upset as I did but I couldn't help myself. She actually said men can be victims but they're not. She said violence against women is much more serious and the people in that other thread were making light of abuse against women and no one was doing anything of the sort. When I are pointed out where she had contradicted herself several times and asked her where the attitude was coming from she got very angry with me and called me a drama queen.

She said it was only a discussion and I told her no it was no longer just a discussion because she had turned it into a debate. I pointed out to her that no one had said that abuse against women was and he was serious than abuse against men and she accused me of not caring about abuse against women. I told her that she needed to educate herself better and that she had seriously just contradicted herself not once but about four times.

She proceeded to call me all kinds of names and tell me that again I was being a drama queen and told me to quote check myself. It's so funny how a narcissist will out themselves even through text. It's kind of funny how you can pick them out even through text just because you've had to deal with them. When you prove them wrong in any kind of way they become very angry. 

I told her that I was done having the discussion and blocked her. Like I said, I know I shouldn't have gotten that upset about it but after you've been through abuse and after you've also had a brother who was an abuse Survivor, it just kind of messes with you.

People who are emotionally invested in being right usually have low self-esteem and have to be right all the time. They are right even when they're not if that makes any sense. They are so immature that to them, admitting to being wrong is admitting to being a dumbass. You can be wrong without being stupid but some people don't see it that way because they have to be right and perfect all the time and think everyone should treat them as such.

 Those people are called narcissist. If you've ever have the unfortunate experience of dealing with one like I have than I feel for you. It's exhausting. I wanted to say to her chill out, it's not that serious but I just told her that I was done having the conversation. It just frustrates me when all you do is gently point out where someone was wrong so that they can learn and they get all bent out of shape.

1c0r0bo,"DV Survivor said my abuse ""isn't that bad"". Now I'm not sure what to do.",steakcakewine,64,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1c0r0bo/dv_survivor_said_my_abuse_isnt_that_bad_now_im/,"I just got out of a lunch meeting with a woman I was introduced to and recommended I speak with from a friend to get some support and counsel during this process. I'm a little flustered, so sorry if this sounds sporadic, but I just needed to vent.

She's in her 50's (I'm in my 30's) and has been out of a very abusive DV relationship for about 10 years now. We were having a really lovely time at first, she shared her story and then asked me about mine. Her story is so incredible, and she dealt with a lot of physical violence that landed her in the hospital. I told her out the gate that I have never been physically hit, that mine is more punched walls, throwing things, screaming, name-calling, gaslighting, control of my location, extreme jealousy, and much more psychological and emotional abuse. His worst moments have also historically been far-between, usually once a year or so. As I was talking and I mentioned I was in a headspace of preparing to leave, which would be fairly easy as we don't have any shared debt or finances, no kids, and both work.

After I'd mentioned that, she shifted the conversation with ""Well, it's not every day, so that's not that bad. Are you wanting to leave because it's easy to?""

The question kind of threw me. I hadn't thought about it that way, so I said ""I guess I don't know.""

Her response was ""If you really want things to work, you have to wait to see if he's going to do anything. If you don't, isn't that a cop-out? At least he's trying.""

I made the statement that his ""trying"" has really just been words so far, not much action. She said ""Action takes time, and you haven't really given it yet. If it isn't all that bad, you could wait to see if he backs up what he says."" She then went on to talk about how if her husband had been willing to try and has stopped his aggression, she would've stayed and waited to see.

I left a bit after that, it honestly shot my anxiety through the roof. I felt pretty confident about my choice, but now hearing from her I feel conflicted and confused. I also feel like that goes against everything that hard data shows. I obviously did not have it nearly as horrifically bad as she did, but I wasn't expecting that kind of response, although I think it was coming out of a place of caring, it really got to me. I cried all the way home.

Has anyone else dealt with this from a fellow survivor? Am I wrong in not having a desire to try harder?  I'm at a complete loss how to take this. She also wants to follow up with me at a later date. I vaguely pushed it off, but I honestly don't ever want to see her again.",2024-04-10 17:18:59,2025-03-17 03:35:20,survivor

1ijzm1e,"Concerning normalisation of dating much older men on social media - just my rambling as a survivor (cw: adult grooming, age gaps, catfishing)",moonlightnocturne,35,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ijzm1e/concerning_normalisation_of_dating_much_older_men/,"Hi, i just wanted to ask - is anybody else extremely concerned and/or triggered by all those viral age gap couples where the guy is like 50-60 and the woman is in her 20s, because I see those advertised to me all the time and as a survivor of adult grooming and catfishing by a man who was 48 and claimed to be 27 in order to seduce me, it's impossible for my brain to comprehend why on earth a guy older than 40 would ever choose to date someone over 10 years younger than himself. Just. *Why*. That could be your daughter.

I understand that in some cases age doesn't matter and ""it's two consenting adults"". But when I first found out that my ex (48M) lied to me about his age when we first met and I was still barely 24, I went through a long denial phase where I looked up age gaps and tried to convince myself that it's okay and ""not grooming because in my 20s I'm already an adult!"". I ignored my gut feelings, I told all of my friends that I think it's fine when middle aged people date young adults, that it's *hot* and so on. 

But now, after breaking up with him and starting my healing journey, my opinion turned very radical. I genuinely cannot understand how someone so young can ever seem like a fulfilling long-term partner to a middle aged person. (And I'm not talking about consensual hook-ups here, I'm talking about very serious and intense relationships that are meant to last.) I know that some older men are not abusers or a threat. However - my ex acted like he was the sweetest, most submissive and non-threatening feminist ally who ""never dated anyone that young before me"" and fell in love with me because it was fate and told me I'm ""mature for my age"" (additional context: I look young, I'm neurodivergent and LGBT, I stim in very childish looking ways and we had a language barrier due to which I DEFINITELY seemed like an innocent child to him when I struggled to communicate in his native language). And that man chose to deceive and date a 21 YEAR OLD right after I dumped him (thankfully I caught on very fast and managed to save them in time). Which just confirmed that I wasn't ""special"", I was just another name on his list.

I know that my trauma has had a lasting effect on my judgment and I may just be triggered / overreacting. But my point is - why are so many people normalising age gaps nowadays? Why are we saying it's ""okay as long as you're in your 20s""? I don't think it's ever okay for someone so much older to steal someone else's youth, even if it seems like it was the younger person who initiated it. Maybe my opinion is too radical now that I'm a survivor, but the whole ""milf/dilf"" seeking thing has become a trigger for me, because of how often it results in abuse and exploitation. It's different when you know from the very beginning and choose to date someone despite the age gap, it's different when you're on the same stage of life - but the thing is, why would it even be an attractive option to the older person unless they had some serious issues with themselves? Why would you date someone a generation below you? I can't even imagine dating anyone 5 years younger than me, let alone 20. I don't get it.",2025-02-07 16:53:47,2025-03-17 03:35:24,survivor

1imn4u6,"The ""support"" I received recently from the national hotline was disturbing and I feel other survivors deserve to know.",dvsurvivor92,42,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1imn4u6/the_support_i_received_recently_from_the_national/,"Ive posted in the past about how ive attempted over dozens of times to be connected to the national domestic violence hotline (US) for support and before literally just this month, I had only gotten through once. They were nice that time and helpful and provided resources and safety planning for me. Im not trying to say they should be defunded at all, Im sure they have help so many survivors, but I do feel the need to share my experiences.

My situation with my childrens father is escalating now alot more than ever before, he is threatening to ruin the life of me and my entire family if I leave him and has threatened to kill me and my pets, he found my resources from before and took them from me. My local shelter options are very limited and Im in a rural, isolated, extremely small town far from any big cities that would have access to more resources, so its not as simple as "" just reach out for support locally"". One my abusers close female friends works at the only shelter available to me within 50 miles. So this is why I was kindof been hoping for more options and potentially lesser known resources from the national hotline. 

The past month, Ive gotten connected to the national hotline three times which felt like a miracle considering last yr I couldnt get connected no matter how many times I tried to call. But I only was left to feel ignored, blamed, and treated like I didnteven matter one bit. 

The first time, the woman I spoke to sounded like a robot, unfeeling and uncaring and sounded like she was reading verbatim from sometype of script. A few of her replies to me didnt match my situation which made it feel scripted, like she kept saying ""you need to find healing and safety for sure"" when I talked about needing transportation resources or talking about the pain in my throat and neck from when he choked me out and slammed my head against a wall last week! She gave generic safety tips that didnt apply to me like, curl up in a ball and protect your head and neck area, when I had told her earlier in the call that Im disabled in a wheelchair and cant do certain movements to protect myself. and at various points, clearly muted herself and I wouldnt hear from her for several several seconds after I was done talking and she would come back and just say ""right right"" and continue with her cold unfeeling script of cold and blunt questions and statements that didnt even apply to me. At one point I heard her doing the dishes in the background and I asked for online support groups and she told me she didnt have none! I didnt feel heard at all and I told her I felt like Im going to die soon and didnt know what to do to protect my children because Im disabled and all she said was youre strong and Im sorry what your going through have you tried documenting the abuse in a journal. Wtf? 

The second time was a man who kept rushing me to answer a bunch of questions, urged me to share details of me sexual assault so that he could help me better when I didnt want to share, and also sounded like he was following a script, and we reached 25ish minutes and he told me he needed to now provide resources and move onto next caller. I felt so dismissed and he spent no time with me for emotional support or safety planning and he just said look at our website for safety tips. I even shared with him my bad experience from before and how I was hoping to have a better call this time and he just said oh you must have called a different place you must be thinking of another hotline not us, so I read the 8007997233 number from my phone log back to him and he said oh well that doesny sound like our hotline! Just made me feel blamed, which my abuser already does to me every day. I asked him to repeat a number because Im hard hard of hearing and he repeated it again really fast and quickly ended our call by saying stay safe and take care and didnt check that I had the number right! 

The third and FINAL TIME I am ever reaching out to this ""hotline"" I only spoke for about two minutes and she said ""we understand you have been calling this hotline and speaking to our agents dozens of times this week and you have been provided support and resources already for your situation"" and she said a few other things to basically dismiss me and insinuate Im a problematic repeat caller!!!! When I have only actually gotten connected to a live person in this hotline less than 5 times!! She said I can speak to you for five minutes only today and then she needs to give up the line or whatever to take other calls. I hung up and cried after. 

THIS is the help for us survivors out here. This hotline receives millions in funding and Im left feeling hopeless and completely ignored, dismissed, and even attacked. Im sure others have had great experiences and for that Im grateful for the hotline and not saying it should be taken down or defunded at all because im sure they do wonders for other people and thats great I'm happy for those people I guess Im not worth help or something about me maybe I don't come off friendly but its hard to be chipper and positive these days. I cant believe this is my experience with them. Somethings gotta be wrong with their training process the past year or something idk. The last woman I talked to told me to calm down when I shared details of my abuse and was crying only a little bit. How is that survivor focused or proper trauma training. My first call with them went so great that I had so much hope to have that again but oh well, Im glad at least for that one woman who was a godsend that day for me a year ago.

Why does the survivor/victim always get blamed instead of the abuser?,_heartglobe,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j8ke8x/streamer_victim_survivorblamed_me_feeling/,"I was badly abused by my ex husband. There was physical, emotional, verbal, financial and sexual abuse. My daughter was conceived through rape. Fortunately I’m out now and my daughter has been adopted out. 
I tuned into my favorite streamer tonight and she was talking about rape. I donated and mentioned what happened to me. She said, “why don’t women fight back?” I said I tried, but he’d get more threatening. She asked why I didn’t take a knife to bed and did that whole, “I’m not victim blaming but-!” thing so many people do. Also, as per usual, she didn’t say, “what a terrible guy!” and blame HIM. She blamed me. Why is it always the victim/survivor who gets the finger pointed at them? (Even if I did have a knife I’d be too scared he was going to turn it on me, and he emotionally abused me saying the cops would take me if I ever fought back against him). Explaining the whole debacle brought back memories and feelings I pushed away years ago.
I’ve been victim/survivor blamed so many times (even by family members) that it’s not surprising anymore. However it still is sad when you get blamed, especially if it’s someone you look up to. I still like this streamer and am not angry, just sad, disappointed, and depressed by her response. I’m working on a book to tell my story and raise awareness so hopefully people will see why the abused react the way they do. Hopefully this will make others better understand the fear and other complicated emotions that go with abusive relationships and help people to be more sympathetic.

1iw8r4j,"Family of DV survivors, how to mend the relationship?",Mediocre-Example-838,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iw8r4j/family_of_dv_survivors_how_to_mend_the/,"This question is both for family members who have or are working on their relationship with the survivor and also for survivors navigating the same. 

I (33non binary) have been navigating healing my relationship with my twin (33 f) after her 7 year abusive relationship.

My question is around the rupture that happens to the relationship between survivors & their support group/ family during DV situations.

The specific areas of rupture/impact that I've noticed are trust, control/boundaries (what are they what aren't they), navigating PTSD, blame feelings. I wonder if you all have noticed others.

My sister's abuser used all forms of abuse in varying degrees, most notably financial and emotional. Towards the end it got very violent and threatened bodily harm (totaled her car in front of her screaming at her, had a gun and threatened himself and her with it- so he didn't hit her but we were all rightly terrified).

She was with him and enduring this for 7 years. Throughout that time myself and my family tried to support her and her children. Over the years things escalated and my sister ended up being isolated and not feeling safe to share with us everything that was happening. This is where the rupture of trust started. She didn't trust us to not say something about the abusive behavior she was experiencing. We lost trust in her ability to tell us. We lost trust in her ability to make sound choices- namely a suitable partner.

It quickly became a horrible cycle. He would move their family further away from us isolating her, we would feel out of control and beg her to just leave him. I remember asking her if there was anywhere on earth he would suggest they move that she wouldn't follow him. Nope.

The boundaries rupture came in mostly towards the end while she was leaving him. He got increasingly violent and vile. Myself and my family felt completely out of control and out of ways to protect her.

I don't think my family understands boundaries well. Also, I don't know if you can set boundaries from a desperate panicked place, not sure. During the car/gun stuff we were hurling ultimatums framed as boundaries at her left and right. ""If you don't leave with your kids right now, I'm going to call the cops."" 
What a powerless feeling to threaten someone you love with something you don't want to do in a desperate attempt to make them protect themself. This also greatly impacted trust, on both sides.

Towards the end he started getting more and more violent (as she remained firm in her decision to be done). He started threatening myself and my mother and my little brother. He totaled her car with his, he had a gun. It was the scariest time in my life. I was so scared that he was going to kill her and the kids and I had her begging and screaming and crying for me to let her handle it and not call the cops. I still regret not calling even if he didn't kill them.

I feel really traumatized by that experience. Obviously it goes without saying that my sister is also traumatized. She's been out of the relationship for 2 years and sharing visitation. My family doesn't interact with her ex at all. 

I think where I'm struggling is integrating what I KNOW about abusive relationships - it takes several times to leave, survivors will often cover for the abuse and make excuses, survivors sometimes take out restraining orders and then immediately drop them. All of these happened. 

and I KNOW why and that it's common and what the psychology is behind it. And my nervous system and my body and yeah parts of my brain can't or don't want to accept that. 

There's part of me that's so mad at her. For giving him access to her in the first place and her children and our family. I blame her for choosing to keep her first pregnancy with him. I blame her for the fact that my nieces have to grow up with a scary dad. I blame her for my PTSD, years out I still can't put my phone on silent or DND. I still get panicked when she calls out of no where. For not seeking financial and housing support bc she would have to name their relationship as abusive. 

I think I'm struggling to accept the real impact of something that wasn't her fault. Are there parts I can ask her to hold responsibility around? 

We're all in therapy! Therapy isn't the same as hearing from others experiences. Please share if you have any insight! I know each situation is different, but I'm curious if anyone can relate. ",2025-02-23 12:09:29,2025-03-17 03:35:33,survivor
1ifgd4j,"*TW descriptions of abuse* I hear domestic abuse every day from the couple downstairs, from a survivor's perspective what would be helpful?",Tie-that-yarn,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ifgd4j/tw_descriptions_of_abuse_i_hear_domestic_abuse/,"They're in their mid 20's like myself and my boyfriend, and I can't believe the amount of rage that comes from the guy multiple times a day, sometimes starting first thing in the morning at 6am. Who the hell has the energy to start yelling at 6am?? She yells at him too sometimes but 70% of it is from him, sometimes absolutely screaming at the top of his voice, stomping around the house like a toddler, slamming doors as hard as he can, pushing furniture over. It's a grown man having temper tantrums and it pisses me off so much, and obviously I am deeply concerned for the girl and their small dog.

It never sounds like the girl or the dog are physically harmed, but obviously I have no way of knowing. It would be obvious that I'm the one that called the police, and I'm scared of him retaliating. Then again, I feel awful for just minding my own business while this girl is suffering. A few times I have said loudly 'What the fuck was that??' to my boyfriend, hoping they'll hear it and realize it isn't okay, but then I thought that maybe pissing off the guy even more was a bad idea. I am just torn in different directions about what to do.

I run into her pretty often since we share the same front door, parking spaces, and trash bins, but we always just say hi and nothing else. The last few times she had such a big startle reflex that it broke my heart. I think next time I see her I'm going to say something, but I have no idea what. 'If you ever need an immediate place to get away from him you can come up to ours'? 'There is help available'? 'Hey are you okay?'?

Everyone's situation, personality, and needs are wildly different. Some might be offended that I'm sticking my nose into it, others might be grateful that I didn't just turn the other cheek. Picture me as your concerned upstairs neighbor, what would you want me to do?

They hurt you because they wanted to.
Because they need to, it is a need for them.
They hurt you not because it wasn’t in their power, but because it was.
And this is what they are choosing to do with it.

They have the power to not say that mean thing, and not hit you, but they choose to.
You becoming better is not going to erase the need to abuse. So it doesn’t matter what you do.

This is what they have chosen you for. Not because they found something special in you. But because you are someone who passed their abuse filter and stayed with them. It is not about you. It is about them.

They aren’t with you because they find you valuable enough to be with you.
They are with you because they find you valuable enough for abuse.

1fp7rws,Survivors - does it get better?,Icy_Hearing_248,9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1fp7rws/survivors_does_it_get_better/,"Hey, so I’m new here.  I’m so frustrated with myself for not being okay so I turned to google to try and make sense of everything.  

I’ve had a read through and it seems a lot of you are still in the situations, trying to work out how to leave, or maybe hanging on to hope that things will change.  I’m sorry - it sucks.  It really sucks.  

When I read other people’s struggles I can’t help but focus on how lucky I am to have got away and had a ‘clean’ break without having to leave my support network.  

Here it goes, I was in an abusive relationship from the age of 19 to 32.  Had first baby at 21 married him at 22and second at 28.  Even in the first few months of being together there were red flags (I hate that phrase!).  He would lock me in his room and not let me leave, or get loud and hold me if I disagreed.  I still decided to have a child with him and get married.  

The abuse was never huge, a push, a slap, nothing ‘serious’ to begin with.  But by the time our son was 1 I had cut off all my friends and learned to keep quiet anytime he treated me badly.  There were times when I was sure we were better and I was happy, but then it would happen again.  By the end of our marriage I was a shell of whoever I once was.  He made all the decisions, took all of my money, I never went out other than to work or school things.  Otherwise I was to be home, cooking, cleaning, helping him with his business.  I literary could feel him sucking the life from me, but I was too scared to do anything.  And too proud to tell anyone, my family were clueless.  In the last year of our marriage he got so much worse.  I was already at the point where every day when his car would pull up I would be terrified.  Then one night he went out drinking and came home and beat me worse than he ever had, he told me he was going to kill me and I believed him.  Our neighbours called the police and when they came the next day he was still in a rage but I lied when they asked if I needed help.  I have no idea why.  I was terrified.  If I had have been brave that could have been the end of it.  

Do the next 9 months the state of fear I felt was uncontrollable.  If he went out at night I would sit up waiting for him to come in.  I would never sleep until he was sleeping.  Then it came to a head at a family event, he had a disagreement with someone there and when I said it would be better if we just left he hit me.  In front of everyone.  No more hiding.  There was a huge commotion but I left and went to my mums (where our kids were).  He turned up later and tried to kick the door down so we called the police, he was arrested and this time I was going to press charges and leave forever.  (I had left him a few times throughout our marriage, but always went back).  

The next three weeks were torture.  Me and the kids stayed with my parents.  He would turn up everywhere.  My parents were away one of the weekends and I slept on the floor so I could see the front door.  I went to stay with my sister to get away and try and get my head together so I could work out our next steps, we couldn’t stay with my mum forever.  

The day after I got there I got the news that he was wanted for SA on a teenager.  He was arrested the same day and remanded in prison.  He has been there ever since.  He would call and write all the time and I only actually worked up the courage to go no contact about 3 month ago.  

So in reality, I am so lucky.  I don’t need to worry about him turning up, causing any more problems, he will likely be deported so I won’t have to move away.  Literally a clean break - and I know so many of you will never get this.  But honestly, I don’t even feel like carrying on anymore (I will, I have two kids who I love more than anything) but I just can’t take this pain.  I thought I would feel liberated, and happy.  This is what I have always wanted, but I feel like a failure, like I don’t even know how to be a person anymore.  I don’t trust anyone.  I do try, but it feels impossible.  I still have nightmares, I still feel like he will just turn up one day.  I’m still terrified.  And I don’t know how to make it stop. 

So I guess I’m looking for hope.  How do you get past this bit?  I just want to feel normal again.  I hate myself for letting him make me feel like this.  I used to be fearless, confident and so positive, there was literally nothing I couldn’t face.  But now I don’t even want to try anymore.  I just feel broken. 

Thanks if you got this far!  For those of you still in abusive situations don’t let this put you off leaving.  Even as bad as I feel now, I could never go back.  Or put my kids back in that situation.  I just think I expect it to feel better than it does.  Leaving is 100% the thing that needs to be done.  They won’t change.

Mine surrounds emotional/ psychological abuse, stonewalling and defensiveness. He would gaslight me into believing everything was fine in our relationship and without warning or any signs broke things off days after my birthday by lying to me. Hero complex because “he didn’t want to ruin my birthday”, so made it extra magical then jumped ship days later. blindsided and pressured me putting me on the spot in scenarios that he knew were out of my comfort zone. Doubting my capabilities /making me feel incapable. Withheld information and would be deceitful. He would put up this “perfect boyfriend” front but internally feel detached emotions and not tell me or allow me the space to work on things together. He completely fooled me into thinking I was in a healthy and loving relationship. He would withhold sex emotionally manipulating me into thinking that I’m a monster when all I was looking for was intimacy with someone I truly loved.

Most of all I can now envision a future for myself where I'm self sufficient and not emotionally dependent on or a doormat for a man. I feel like I have a new sense of resilience and self reliance.

1e57a1z,I need of support right now.

I am so tired of doing this all alone.  Tonight, I need to go through financial documents proving financial abuse and send it to my lawyer before start of business tomorrow. My ex owes me $4000+ in daycare expenses alone and at least a couple thousand more in a variety of other expenses like the cell phone bill for example.  I normally love numbers and am one of those weird people that enjoys balancing a checkbook but this feels like the most impossible task in the world.  When will it feel like I am not just surviving day to day.
I have been dragging my feet for months on getting the information to the lawyer bc I know once it is sent, that within less than 24 hours my ex-husband will retaliate with whatever new disturbing emotional and verbal attacks and I just cannot handle it anymore. Yet, if I don't put the stuff together and send it to my lawyer, I'll never get my money back. I feel mentally and physically frozen. I need help right now but I don't have anyone that can come sit with me to help me do it and I did ask about five friends and of course no one is available last minute.  I'm tired of trying to explain to my non-abuse survivor friends why I cannot plan out ahead of time a scheduled time and date to do this type of stuff.  The reality is abuse incidents and post abuse trauma happens randomly at any given time and when I reach out is the earliest I was able to make you aware.  I’m sorry right now is inconvenient for your schedule. It’s not great for mine either. In fact, the email I read in two minutes is going to set me back at least one full day, l likely more.  And asking for help alone is so so difficult, and it is even more defeating when your support people are all unavailable.  
I was at work and I received an email from my lawyer and had to leave work immediately. I barely made it to the car before I burst into tears. I called my gf (who also is also abuse victim, different abuser) and currently out of town and she is helping me as much as she can from a distance. But it just sucks. How do you explain to a non-abuse victim friend that you are essentially in crisis having an emergency situation when what you are dealing with in any other circumstance would not cause you to go into complete meltdown mode and would certainly not require assistance?  I don't feel comfortable saying, hey um I know you have kids and don't understand really why this is an emergent issue, but it is and I need you to drop what you’re doing and come help me.   It feels selfish to ask this of them especially when I can tell they don't see what the big deal is.  And I'm tired of trying to explain the lasting effects of abuse to them and how it affects my abilities to complete certain tasks or that I need them with me just in case he calls or starts texting me awful things or just because I am currently having some sort PTSD response to this task and I am having a complete meltdown now. Sometimes I wish he had hit me too so I had physical proof on my person that could be put in a police report, or just so my friends could relate to the urgent fear I feel when I text them for help and request they come over asap. To be clear I am not serious about wishing physical violence on myself, but I don't know how to explain to them that feeling of terror while also knowing I need to still remain calm enough to parent and get some urgent task done which induces panic. Sometimes as an abuse survivor it is just not possible to function and it doesn’t matter how important the current responsibilities are and that is when I need them to come help or at least call me.  If I don't have another person with me, it takes me too long to recover and get my work done which leads to more issues. With my gf also being a abuse victim, I don't have to explain anything to her, she gets it and knows I just need her presence to feel safe so that I can be productive again. Why is this concept so freaking hard for non-abuse victims to understand? I’m exhausted and I need help. I would come right over and just bring my kids with me or call the babysitter and try to get someone to watch them. And the worst is many of my friends have done this for myself or others in the friend group when it was some sort of other emergency, but when it comes to abuse related help, it’s like I’m inconveniencing them by even asking.   I’m sure they don’t feel that way, but I do because the answer is always, sorry I can’t come help last minute.",2024-07-17 02:42:09,2025-03-17 03:35:57,survivor

I have never felt so cold under a thousand layers.

And even though you were one of the few who was able to peel those back-

I have been frozen since;

Confused and unsure why I allowed you to see what was inside of me when my body tried to tell me that I was frosting over.

I should have listened to the icicles in my veins when they whispered 'run' into my delicate mind;

But my gentle heart wanted nothing more than to see your good before your bad.

I should have listened to the snowstorm screaming in my stomach when we first met;

Flashbacks of everyone who has done me wrong appeared on your lifeless face.

In those moments-

The ones where I was pneumonia-ridden and gasping for love,

I prioritized you over myself.

You had only been drowning yourself in wonderland and lying to me about the girls who claimed they would give you summer.

Before we met I was summer.

I was summer. 

Your winter rubbed off on me and I fell so hard into your snow that I was no longer my favorite season;

I had become the one I dreaded most.

I hated winter, except for how it looked on you. 

I do not blame you. 

I blame me, for giving away such a kind and valuable love to a boy who ripped out my heart with his bare, dirty hands and ran with it; laughing and singing his way to the next self-preserved woman to see what body parts of hers he could add to his collection of lies and abuse.

I no longer have energy to value myself or God;

Whom I used to care for more than anything-
Before that spooky night watching the airplane runway where the little girl in me fell in love with the number one person she was not supposed to. 

I refuse to be winter after she texted me from your phone;

But right now I am both hot and cold, unable to decipher between my good and bad parts.

I am sad. I am lost. I am confused.

But the one thing I care about most right now is how your new beautiful summer girl will shortly become the deep and dark winter which you will enforce upon her. 

The only thing I feel is for her.

A beautiful soul she must be-

Like I once was;

Standing vulnerably in line to have her heart shredded.”

I wrote this in 2016- specifically on the night he ghosted me and left the state for another woman. I had felt so relieved, but so hurt at the same time. I didn’t think too much into what I was writing, I just let my thoughts flow with my tears and fell asleep. 

Years later I discovered I still had this as a note in my phone, and finally realized what had actually happened to me: I had major stockholm syndrome, my indivuality had been eradicated, and I was codependent on a man who hurt me in all types of ways. He got me hooked on substances (a dual meaning for my “winter” references) despite knowing I never wanted to become a user after what happened to my mother. The entire relationship, my subconcious knew I was being abused but I didn’t want to come to terms with it. I needed the attention in whatever form it was presented to me. The day he left was the miracle that I never could admit to myself I needed.

I read it to myself every once in a while. It reminds me how it’s very easy for me to fall into codependency and ignore my own wellbeing when I start to fall for a new peson. I’ve spent a long time cultivating a beautiful self love so that I don’t allow myself to tumble into another obvious ditch with bright red flags around it, just because the person already in the ditch tells me about their trauma or gives me the attention I’m so desperate for. 

It reminds me how I had the strength to overcome deep psychological manipulation and physical abuse all those years ago, and I never let it turn me into a bad person. I held on to my empathy and continued trying to be the best person I can be for myself. Now, I’m able to help others who’ve gone through similar things. I’m so proud of myself for that and I never give myself enough credit.

Sorry if any of this is a bit vague, however I do hope there’s someone who reads this and can relate. Maybe someone will read this and find the courage to acknowledge it’s abuse, the courage to leave, or even the courage to start to heal.

I promise you it gets better. I promise you recovery is possible. Healing is hard but it’s necessary and worth it. Trust me. If you don’t want to talk about it-write about it- because your future recovered self will admire you and it’s the best fucking feeling.

uhk2gh,Mod Note Re: Posts About BPD,Ebbie45,1173,267,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/uhk2gh/mod_note_re_posts_about_bpd/,"Hello, there has always been a large number of comments in this sub about BPD, or Borderline Personality Disorder. Some comments are supportive, while many others are generalizing, derogatory, and stigmatizing. Moreover, after a recent post stating that individuals with personality disorders should be incarcerated or put down, it's far past time for a mod post on this subject.

BPD is an emotion dysregulation disorder that is commonly associated with unstable self-image and relationships. It is a mental illness that is often described by affected individuals as debilitating and extremely emotionally painful.

The majority of reported cases of BPD occur in women. While research on the causes and contributing factors to BPD is still mixed, some evidence suggests that experiences of abuse, trauma, neglect, and abandonment can be involved in the development of the disorder.

An increasing number of comments in this sub have involved ""diagnosing"" abusers described in posts with BPD, despite commenters lacking the clinical expertise to make such diagnoses. Many of these comments make inaccurate assumptions about BPD in such a manner that contributes to stigma against the disorder, and perpetuate the notion that all individuals with BPD are abusive. This is unequivocally false.

There are a large number of abuse *survivors* in this sub who have actually been diagnosed with BPD by experts. Comments that diagnose abusers with BPD or equate BPD to abuse perpetration do a disservice to every abuse survivor in this sub who has the disorder.

This is not a sub in which it is ever appropriate to encourage, condone, or contribute to any stigmatization against mental illnesses.

Understandably, BPD is a complex and often understudied disorder. It is also understandable that some individuals have experienced trauma while happening to be in a relationship with someone with BPD. That being said, this sub will not be a place that allows the generalization of all individuals with BPD.

Please be mindful of your comments moving forward. Please do not diagnose anyone with BPD. If you suspect that a commenter's partner has a mental illness, that is the area of expertise for a trained clinician. Remember who is present in our sub and remember that many abuse survivors have mental illnesses, and all of us are harmed if we reach a place where we equate mental illness to abuse.

Please take care of yourselves and each other.",2022-05-03 16:34:27,2025-03-17 03:36:09,survivor

We work in the same industry. I got away from the abuse and shut him out and he can’t stand that he cannot control me anymore. The abuse kept me shut down for a long time, I was a shell of a person. Slowly I’ve gotten stronger and reclaimed joy in my life.

I’ve been strong to a point and have managed to avoid face to face contact, but he is slowly encroaching into areas of my field where I’m highly involved (he never had anything to do with these areas the past). It has been several things, not a one off. I think it’s him testing the waters, but he’s also using it as an opportunity to try to control me in the professional setting.

I have a committee meeting coming up which I know he’ll be attending. I’ve been on this committee for years and he has never been involved before. He told someone who he know would tell me he’s coming, so I think he’s trying to intimidate me into not attending - which is what the old me would have done. But I want to attend this meeting because it’s an area I’m passionate about, and I don’t want to let him control my life.

I have so much fear about him being there. I also have a fear he will try to join the committee as it will be a way to have ongoing contact with me.

I am extremely frightened. I feel sick just thinking about being in his presence. He’s very cunning. If he has an opportunity to blindside me he will. I need to make a plan not only to keep myself safe, but to make sure I can have a productive meeting and flourish doing what I love, even if he tries to cut me down. At this meeting I want to put forward my nomination for the ongoing chair of this committee and he might undermine me.

I hate that I have to think like this, but at the moment I’m not strong enough to know that I will be ok in the meeting. I’m using this as an opportunity to make a plan so that I can still go to my meeting and be involved because it’s what I want to do for myself. It’s also an important step in my healing journey. He’s going to try to hold power over me. So this is a chance for me to hold my power

Survivors, could you help me think about actions I can take here to prepare and protect myself?

Ideas I had:
- I will reach out to as many work friends as I can to attend with me. This way I won’t be alone as I enter and leave the building or go to the bathroom. But I also will have allies to help with the discussion if I am feeling overwhelmed, also they could help to vote for me as chair.
- I have a feeling my ex will try to stack the committee and take over the agenda, he’s good at using people to do his bidding for him. So I need to anticipate this and be a step ahead. Any other ideas of what I can do?
- I will think about how I want to come across. This is work so I think being professional and extremely calm will be important, even if he pushes my buttons. Should I even acknowledge him? Part of me thinks he’d have the shock of his life if I calmly addressed him during group discussion. Or is it better I don’t acknowledge him at all? Head extremely narcissistic so perhaps the greyrock method and being as boring as possible would be better.
- I think I’ll print a few of my reports and bring them to the committee, it’s good background and will help put me forward in a professional light. It also gives me something physical to refer to if I have trouble collecting my thoughts.

Any other ideas?

This is coming from a burner account, but I’m always so grateful for this support community here. Thankyou all",2023-11-04 08:57:36,2025-03-17 03:36:16,survivor

a year ago i (22f) dated a guy i met off of tinder for three months. we were both 21, and i was in my junior year of college. beforehand i had never been in a committed relationship due to social withdrawal from childhood sexual abuse and only being in short term situationships or hookups. this is a chronological list of this guys behavior:

- every single day he wanted sex and made me feel guilty when i didnt want to

- we got into the relationship within a week of seeing each other and not even into the first week he was already pressuring me into sex

- one of the main things was he was so pushy about sex and anything affectionate we did always had to lead to sex on his part. cuddle in bed? has to lead to sex. take a bath together? sex. always sneaky about it and always repeatedly asking me. making me feel like i was easy and thats all

*and* before all of this i was sexually assaulted twice by two different guys that same year i got together with this dude, and during the course of our relationship i was just starting to process the trauma of being assaulted.

- he made up a story of a ""recent"" ex cheated on him and how hes ""always been cheated on"" in relationships as an excuse to pressure me into sex with him. he would constantly change the timeline of when he dated this person. 

- towards the end of the second month of us dating i became more distant because of all of the pressure he put on me for sex and physical affection. that same year when we got into a relationship i had been sexually assaulted twice. he clearly noticed and became more awful towards me. 

- when we took a trip a state over, when i didnt want to have shower sex with him (it wasnt even supposed to be a sexual moment i literally just wanted to shower!!!) and got out of said shower he later came into the room, he threw a pillow really hard in my direction and angrily told me about how he doesnt get what he wants. 

- he also hit me (it was light tapping) twice in the back when i turned over away from him when we were sleeping because at this point he was starting to force physical affection too

- the stress of him constantly accusing me of not loving him enough or being faithful to him caused me to have a horrible asthma attack 

- found out he used to say the n-word in high school (we are both white) after i made him kick out his also white friend for saying it. this was the final straw for me and i had made my decision to break up with him then and there, but i waited another weekend to actually confront him. 

- the day we broke up and i confronted him on his past racist behavior, he did not apologize and made excuses for his friend. i laid it all out and told him that he was no different than the people who abused me before. i said something about, to make him mad, how i can finally text all those guys he was so worried about me cheating on him with (there weren't any) and he got so angry with me that he slammed things off of his desk, near where i was sitting and near where his cats were, and went upstairs and started throwing things around and knocking things over. i remember backing into a corner and having to de-escalate his anger.

the aftermath:

- i lost all of my memory from anytime before june 2022 and after that, i can barely remember a single thing that happens to me from a span of a week. 

- my work ethic became terrible and my adhd and social anxiety worsened

- i barely made it through the rest of college

- shortly after breaking up with him, i had lost nearly all of the few friends i had made in college during covid due to the fact that i told them i left an abusive relationship

- i am even MORE socially isolated and defensive around others than before because of it, hurting my career prospects

- i feel like i am bullied by strangers, coworkers, and friends everywhere i go. i hate going out in public. everything triggers me.

- loud popping and slamming sounds bother me even more now than before

i feel like im overreacting and exaggerating what happened because i keep thinking that i just managed to escape a really shitty guy. but that moment when he was slamming things around me and his cats scared the shit out of me. i genuinely think that if i stayed he would have punched me. this has affected my life in so many awful ways it is really hard to stay motivated to live. i am crying as i write this.",2023-10-17 06:51:04,2025-03-17 03:36:25,survivor

I found and arranged all the paperwork for agency supervised visits at the end of August. Abuser dragged his feet. He has agency supervised visitation for Wednesdays and Saturdays. My attorney emails his attorney every couple days asking for updates on if he even did ibis intake interview let alone schedule a visit. They ignore or all communication and never inform us that they will not make the visit per the orders. 
I push hard today for my attorney to demand answers because, I find out he is skipping the supervised visitation part of the orders and just getting the anger management portion of this step in the progressive parenting plan done- per the orders, ones he’s done with classes visits no longer have to be supervised. 
He lied to my attorney claiming this morning that the intake interview was done and that the agency is asking for too much information that is difficult for him to provide as the reason for delay. (The agency confirmed that he didn’t have the intake done as of yesterday and that the moment he finishes the interview it’s their policy to alert the coparent.) 
A few hours later after lunch the agency emails me that he finished his interview and that they have to comply with orders that state two visits a week, and since their week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday, would a agree to not only the ordered 10-12 block on Saturday, but also on Sunday. 

After some back and forth, it was clear, if I didn’t cancel my appointment for a domestic violence survivor group program (I was wait listed and found out at 6am today I got the opening to start on Sunday) then I would be noncompliant with the court orders. 

So this guy takes an axe to his family, terrorizes us to the point we leave and are homeless, demands in court for equal parenting time, cries that he hasn’t seen his kid since I left months ago (he has seen via zoom in a supervised virtual call I set up since June and he finally agreed to start beginning September), get orders for visitation, goes radio silent, then all of a sudden we have to drop everything for him?!

I keep every Wednesday and Saturday wide open for time flexibility. I offer to change the kids class schedule, I do everything for him to just see his kid, and nothing. Now he finally does something and it has to be the exact same time as my therapy?!

The irony of my abuser forcing me to drop the therapy for the ptsd his domestic violence caused so he can randomly see his kid only because I am the only one advocating for his relationship with my child. And, if I dare say no because it’s now Friday evening 6PM and this is virtually no notice, then I am the one not following the orders. 

I left the abuser but I can’t seem to get away from the controlling abuse. I stopped him from hurting me in person, but now he can prevent me from getting better. I don’t think there is a word to describe how I feel about him.",2023-09-23 09:01:50,2025-03-17 03:36:28,survivor

I wish I could be reaching out under better circumstances, as I'm sure there are a lot of wonderful people on here. I am a 30 (F). As it says in the title, I was in an abusive relationship when I was in my teens. I've never felt comfortable reaching out to other domestic violence survivors because my abuser never got physical with me and we were best friends first, so for the longest time I didn't think it counted. I didn't even know I was in an abusive relationship until two years afterward. I really need to get this story off my chest.

He was my best friend first. When I was fourteen, a freshman in high school, I met A Boy, who was a sophomore. We were thrown together in our school's winter musical and bonded as chorus members. I had been warned about him before. Upperclassmen warned me away from him, saying he was odd without specifying why. Only that he was über-religious, but I thought nothing of that. Funnily enough, I was also sort of a misfit growing up, and all I had wanted was for someone to talk to me, befriend me. So that's how I approached him. I knew we had both been bullied and I knew we were both oddballs, I thought we could bond over that. So, over the course of my freshman year, especially during rehearsals for the school musical, we became friends. He was who I went to when my divisive core friend group decided to turn against itself; I was who he went to when he wanted help navigating difficult social situations. We had inside jokes. We became best friends.

Looking back, it's difficult not to berate myself for ignoring everyone who warned me about him. I feel so stupid because he had made threats about shooting up the school that I somehow overlooked? A Boy made those threats the year before I got there and I heard it primarily through rumors, but my behavior was still pretty clown shoes. I’m unsure of how I could have overlooked something like that, the only explanation I can come up with is that there wasn’t as much awareness around mass violence when I was in high school. As much as it pains me to say it, shootings weren’t as common back then. There were no drills, no awareness around how to handle that kind of situation. According to my classmates, A Boy was placed on academic probation and let back in after a couple of months. Other kids were terrified that he was allowed to come back.

The abuse cycle started when I was fifteen. We were on and off for six months, during which I developed a self-harm problem due to burgeoning anxiety and depression, academic overachieving, cruel friends, authoritarian parents, etc. When I came to A Boy looking for help with cutting, he asked if I had cut myself with stainless-steel scissors, because if I hadn't, I would get tetanus and die.

There were other things he did that would take too long to explain here. There was shoving, yelling at and humiliating me in the school cafeteria to the point where I had a full-blown panic attack. He made a point to tell me about a punching bag he had hanging in his basement; about a former schoolmate for whom he'd lost all respect because she'd posted nude photos of herself on Facebook. He said nudity and sexuality were ""against his religion.""

The worst was the silent treatment when I did something he didn't like. He would just storm off. But this was a small school, and word traveled fast. Other kids would approach me and tell me the things A Boy had said about me behind my back: I was an ""indecisive bitch""; I would rather date “retarded faggots"" than date him. I was terrified that he would get physical. When I went to my mother for help, she said I was being a tease and to stop leading him on. My father said that A Boy could not have been abusive, because he was small and ungainly. My therapist at the time had labeled me ""boy crazy"".

I lived in fight or flight for months. Would wake up every school morning wondering if this was the day I would be beaten, or worse. Eventually, I just broke down. I was admitted to a psychiatric facility for eight weeks. Even then, A Boy my harassed my friends day in and day out stalking me, asking them, ""Where is she? I'm really worried about her."" My friends called the ward, asking my permission for them to let him know I was in psychiatric treatment. I said no, and it took everything just to say no. But I saw he was coming after me through my friends and didn't know what else to do. I was sixteen and I weighed 95 pounds at the time of my discharge. I started having nightmares from which I would wake screaming.

And I've seen pictures of A Boy with a rifle. I did try to confront him, about five years after the fact. He said that I had ruined him. He couldn't go on dates, he'd turned even more to religion. He was ""nothing but a monster"" that I wrote about. And I was his ""cross to bear,"" his ""penance."" I yelled at him, said some things I'm not proud of. I didn't want to be a player in his show of martyrdom, and I haven't spoken to him since. I've blocked him on every social media platform and have set all my socials to private.

I'm thirty now. I've been lucky enough to have found a really good therapist. I'm married to a loving husband, and we have two cats. I write in my free time. Recently, I've been doing grueling healing work with my therapist. It's taken me upwards of a decade to find empathy for who I used to be, to admit that I miss who I used to be. That I was a kid. And there is a moment, with the news of each new shooting, right before the gunman's identity is announced, when the pulse sings high and fast in my ears and everything slides out of focus. There's a lot I find I'm unable to communicate to my husband, because the nature of trauma is that it's unspeakable. He knows the raw materials of the situation, but sometimes I just don't know how to tell him that I still feel so raw, like a walking exposed nerve. In my mid-twenties, I made an effort to get fit and to bulk up, and I have found the gym to be a safe space away from home, but sometimes it’s still draining just to get out of bed. I still get the nightmares. I struggle with leaving the house and being in social situations. I’m on medication for PTSD and anxiety.

My therapist says my intentions with A Boy were sincere: I saw someone in need of a friend and tried to help him out. But I question myself every day. I am stable, but I am not okay.

I know this is heavy. And I'm so sorry if I've spooked or triggered anyone. Kindness is appreciated, even an upvote helps. And if you read this far, thank you.",2023-08-30 23:44:22,2025-03-17 03:37:31,survivor

My podcast has become more and more detailed in the DV niche and it’s my mission to empower victims to become survivors and help all I can. I’m finally getting traction which is motivating me even more as this is what I feel born to do. I am so excited to show women the other side of life! After being stuck myself in an abusive marriage, I can’t believe how amazing life can really be once freed. 

I’m looking to expand on topics to help victims, but would love thoughts and ideas. I recently did a long series on “Is he abusive or just an a-hole?” that went really well so I feel like my audience wants more.

vixui8,how do you manage infatuation when dating when you are a survivor of abusive relationships?,Ambie_Valance,14,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/vixui8/how_do_you_manage_infatuation_when_dating_when/,"Hi! I'm new here. I was in abusive relationships when i was young, so last one has been 8years ago. It has taken me a lot to recover due to me finding out i had complex ptsd in this time as well. First 3 years after my last abusive relationship, I was terrified of anyone approaching me, i couldn't date, the thought of kissing sb was already scary. After that I dated around, had lil stories, ranging from ok to bad and easy to v difficult, mostly exploring all i wasn't able to explore that much in my youth (like my bisexuality) and managing triggers, limerence and flashbacks. 

That was a bit for context, my abuse history doesn't feel present anymore and i manage my c-ptsd pretty well. But i still have doubts about dating new people, and one of them is how to go through infatuation, through the initial stage where dopamine gets high. I realized I?ve often had fwb relationships bc they weren't strong on infatuation and that made it easy for me (no expectations or triggers, etc). Or I had sex w people i didn't like, but was still attracted to them enough to have fun w it. A lot of emotional and relationship avoidance basically. I'm still not sure I want a serious relationship atm (only if it would fit my life and goals, which would be really difficult), but I met sb i like and would like to be balanced in this initial stage, to enjoy my time w him. I don't want to cut him off out of fear as i still don't know him, and i dont want to be afraid of enjoying the emotions that come up while getting to know him, but i obviously want to feel ok and not get into a risky situation. Was wondering how others handled this balance.",2022-06-23 14:11:17,2025-03-17 03:37:36,survivor

I (33F) have been married to my husband (34M) for 5 years. We’ve been together for 7 years. We have a 2 year old together. I was in a 5 year abusive relationship with a man 10 years older than myself prior to this relationship. It was very abusive. I also have estranged myself from my family of origin because of abuse. I see and have seen a specialized psychotherapist for years and also have been in therapy years and years before. It’s a constant and I feel safe in therapy. 


My husband had been drinking one day. He got home from golf at 12:30pm and was clearly intoxicated. I noticed and asked how many drinks he had and he immediately started to gaslight me into thinking I have a drinking problem. I do not. My family has issues with substance use disorder, so I’m limited when I drink. I feel triggered when he’s drunk or others are. I avoid it. 

He's financially abusive. He recently forced me to cut back on therapy because he said it's too expensive, but he wouldn’t share bank info with me besides our joint account. This changed yesterday when I confronted him after many confrontations. He shared the financial information after he told me he doesn’t trust me with money. Then said he thought I’d empty everything and leave. That is not a thought I’ve even had. 

I feel trapped. I can't get a job because I'm about to have surgery for endometriosis. That alone is an issue because he doesn't understand the pain I deal with chronically and he doesn't seem to care. He tells me I don't do fun things with our 2 year old, however, I do. I do what my body allows me to do. He is constantly shaming me for my limitations and this makes me feel as if I'm a bad parent. 

I am estranged from my family due to violent and emotional abuse my entire life. I don't have a support system built yet. I'm very scared of him because he's not himself when he drinks. He just left randomly in the middle of the day to go golf. It’s a work day. I now don’t have access to a car with my child, I also have to hope he doesn’t return home drunk. He’s even thrown a heavy crystal picture frame at me back when I was pregnant during an argument. I’m scared of making him angry. He’s yelled at me and slammed doors in front of our baby. 

He’s responsible for recent sexual coercion. I can’t be intimate because of my endometriosis. It causes me intense pain that lasts days. He has tried to convince me to do things for him and I reluctantly have. I feel a lot of shame. I hate this life. 

I know I need to leave, I’m terrified. I’m posting because I’ve only talked to my therapist about most of this. I’m afraid to share info with my closest friend. She lives in another state. I wish I could get this all figured out. I feel frozen and I don’t know what to do or where to start. 

I’ve spoken with the domestic abuse hotline recently. I know there are resources. I’m very worried about custody if I leave. I have CPTSD, depression, Dissociative Identity Disorder, major anxiety and I’m sure he’d end up with our child and could use my diagnoses against me. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m scared and very isolated. I need support desperately. Even from strangers. It’s hard being a survivor of abuse and enduring it all over again. I am so afraid of starting over. I don’t know where I’d even go.",2023-06-07 19:26:58,2025-03-17 03:37:37,survivor
14wapc2,Body shaming abusers here only hurts survivors and shouldn't be allowed on any support sub.,DiscardedVictim,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/14wapc2/body_shaming_abusers_here_only_hurts_survivors/,"I don't have much to say about this since it's one of the most exhausting topics to discuss for me personally.

A few months ago, I saw a post on either this sub or another survivor community that celebrated a user's abuser going bald as some form of karmic justice. As a balding survivor who comes to these subs for support, community, and empowerment, what I read only made surviving what I went through more difficult at what was the lowest point of my life.

OP and the comments all seemed to show no awareness as to how many AMAB survivors in -all- support subreddits had to (or continue to) go through our genetic ""male"" pattern baldness being accelerated by the stress our abusers put us through. Many of the comments perpetuated blanket statements like ""going bald is punishment for being a bad person,"" which I'm sure all abusers of us with the MPB gene would LOVE to be true. At the time, it took all the restraint I had to not point out how toxic the post/comments were, and how comparable their mentalities were to those many of our abusers would subscribe to.

My hair loss is something my abuser used to devalue me that I can't ever change. I have no doubts that she continues to make jokes to this day that revolve around her replacement(s) for me being an upgrade since they're not losing their hair. The years which I had a full head of hair were wasted on and shortened by pursuing a textbook case of BPD with antisocial tendencies.

Now that nobody is there to help her keep her alcoholism in check, my abuser has gained noticeable weight since discarding me. However, you'll never see me celebrating what often is the result of another survivor's trauma, especially in a public community consisting predominantly of such survivors seeking help.

TL;DR: When you use body shaming to devalue your abuser, you assist many of our abusers in devaluing us.",2023-07-10 23:55:11,2025-03-17 03:37:38,survivor

Why aren't we automatically informed when someone new reports them as abusive?! I spend nights awake staring at the ceiling panicking because I know he's dating someone now, and I know this woman has kids, I know no other details. But I feel physically sick knowing what he will eventually do to her and how he will mess up those children by hurting their mum or (I desperately hope not) hurting them.

I don't want to know her details, I just want her to get a copy of my video interview, and I want to be notified if she ever goes to the police so I can fucking remind them I came forward too so they don't dismiss her.

I think the thing that hurts me most about the police throwing my case in the bin is that it means he can escalate. I've seen enough to know that when (not if!) he kills a woman the prosecutor will use me as an example of how he has behaved previously. It shouldn't get to that. 

I know he will do it again. He nearly killed me more than once.
I'm alive because I pretended to be dead a few times and eventually ran with nothing except my cat ffs. I just can't sleep at the minute because I'm terrified I'll wake up to a news story of a woman stabbed to death and her kids either orphaned or dead.

There was no way that would feel safe telling the truth about what was really happening, so it only served to drag the relationship on even longer.  As long as the abuser was there it did not feel like a safe space.

The only thing that did work out for me in couple’s therapy was after I was talked in to going back for a second round of therapy, this was after I had told him I wanted out of the marriage. It was the first session, and I just blurted out everything had been happening the whole time, including the suicide threats. I said I had wanted out for a very long time but he would threaten to kill himself. The therapist immediately separated us, she told me to go home and pack everything I needed, and made us go no contact for two weeks (which he broke within 2 days). I never went back.

Advice for survivors with no justice?,saintbreezus08,10,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/vjvj5k/justice_system_fails_the_abused_once_again_advice/,"This is a really long story that I will do my best to consolidate without leaving too many details out…

In April of 2020 I met the single worst person I think I ever have, in my life to date. I was already in uncertain times with just losing my job due to Covid, living alone going crazy. Feeling very vulnerable. Got bored, scrolled tinder and hit it off with my (soon to be) abuser.

Things were wonderful at first. We had so much in common with they way we grew up even names of family members being the same. We spent a lot of time together. I noticed small little lies in the beginning (he said he had a car, first time we meet he’s in an Uber not intoxicated… he admits later her never has said car etc.) things that seemed stupid to harp over considering how bonded we felt immediately. After about a month of being in each other’s constant presence and including being intimate as well… he ghosts me. Me being me (dumb and blind), I kept trying to figure out what I did and his response was always so vague. I backed off and went about my life (although admittedly, very hurt).

Summer 2020 is now here and he decides to contact me again where we start a similar cycle as before. Always together, making food, watching movies just enjoying each other. But this time he doesn’t ghost me. He stays around and starts sneaking insulting comments in when he talks to me (telling me how incompetent I am, commenting on my weight) he was not working at this time either, but did not have unemployment benefits like I had due to the pandemic. I was paying for literally everything for us to survive and not really keeping tabs because I just wanted to help this man who I thought had love for me too. And that’s why ignored all of these little red flags to begin with. During this time, a lot of personal issues happened to me (I won’t deny that we were drinking a lot together at this time, as well as him having a cocaine issue, more on that later) I actually ended up with a dui and my car was stolen a month later. Feeling down on my luck and in a major depressive state, I continue to stay with this person. He starts needing money a lot or saying he will go get us food and just not coming back. Tensions are running high and I start seeing his true colors. He never cared about me and was using me. I wanted him out of my life, I just didn't have the strength at that moment.

One evening, he was out with his friends and came home very drunk and under the influence of prescription drugs as well. We were both drinking (I had just started, he had already been) I was also making dinner when he starts accusing me of stealing one of his AirPods. Which I didn’t, I later found it in my couch. He goes ballistic. Rips my entire closet out. Throws a full length mirror out of my 3rd story apartment, smashes my tv in. Leaves with a cell phone I bought and let him use when his broke. At this point I needed to be done so I call police. Cops arrive and are very dismissive when they find out we were drinking. I want to file a report but I am afraid so I don’t.

The rest of summer goes on and I don’t hear from him and don’t contact him either. But he did leave a lot of clothes at my house like he always did… as a means to contact me later. At this point it is fall, beginning of November and he contacts me about these things which I was more than happy to give him. He comes over and another cycle begins. This time, his living situation takes a turn and he becomes homeless due to being evicted. Although I did not want him residing in my house, I truly felt bad and didn’t want him homeless for the holidays. So I let him stay. He starts telling me he loves me, I was on probation and quit drinking. But he was still doing drugs and drinking. I witness first hand how on edge and desperate his addiction can make him and I know that I can't go on much longer like this. The insults are getting worse, I knew his temper from before when he destroyed my house. He is paranoid and starts accusing me of giving him STD's starts insinuating that he would kill himself and me if it were true.  It was all too much and I felt utterly stuck and didn't know what to do because he always guilt tripped me into letting him stay.

Things are bad at this point and to make matters worse, he started pulling back and not being affectionate anymore. Still called me baby when he needs something and when he was manipulating but stopped sleeping in bed with me and pretty much set up camp in my living room. This was not how I wanted to live I was miserable and my self esteem was all but gone. Our arguments were always volatile and one night I found used condoms. I was disgusted and confronted him and he lies and says him and his friend were playing pranks on people. I let it go but knew he lied, I was just so week and downtrodden in these times and didn't want another argument. Then, I find work, YAY! I go back to work and it was so liberating. I found a little confidence and was feeling better even though home life was bad. One night I went home and again started making dinner. I slipped up and brought some alcohol home. I drank a beer and 4 shots I believe. As for him, it appeared he had been drinking all day. He was fine until I started talking about a coworker at work who I found to be attractive (I know that was a very bad decision in hindsight but I did it and I take responsibility for that) he flies into another rage fit and chokes me out with my scarf while calling me a whore, disgusting telling me I like what he was doing. I thought at first he was being playful, but when he wouldn't let go I knew I had to do something so I tried breaking free and facetimed my friend as my phone was in hand from just talking with her. She picks up and see's the very end of this interaction when I broke away and I immediately go and lock myself in my room crying and talking to her. I calm down and ask him why he would do that and I don't remember his reasoning but he then proceeded to say he was going to skin me, wear my as a blanket... kill my cat... kill me with a chainsaw like in American Psycho. All with a smirk on his face. I decide to not engage and go to bed. I was shocked and afraid.

The next day was a Friday. I knew I did not want to be around him so I made plans to stay with a friend. I go out to her place straight after work and don't speak to him. I wake up on Saturday and decide I would like to see him ( this is the worst thing about toxic relationships, the I hate you but I love you parts) I take a Lyft home because I did not know if my car would start with my breathalyzer since we stayed up super late. I get home and he is leaving but it was Valentines day weekend, I was hoping he could have courtesy to stay with me. He said he would not. I said well before you come back, we need to have a conversation about the other night. He becomes angry and I had absolutely had it at this point. I say you need to leave, forever. Don't forget your clothes this time okay? So I go to my closet and start grabbing his things. This makes it worse. I turn around from my closet and he pushes me over holds me down and strikes me in the face. I am screaming crying telling him to leave and he does and leaves his key on my table. I am in shock and adrenaline kicks in. I know I need to leave so I get my cat and go back to my friends house. I couldn't find my regular set of keys and so I grabbed his key he gave me and left. I ended up with a fat, bruised and cut lip, some scratches and the beginning of bruises on my chest. I take pictures of what I could. My friend drove me home to search for my keys and I find them. I still did not feel safe there so I grab my keys and put the spare on the hook. That night (valentines) I kept getting calls from the call box of my apartment but I knew it was him and did not answer.

It is now Monday and I went to work. On lunch I come home and find he had somehow gotten in. There is a cake, flowers and a handwritten note from him apologizing for leaving. I am now petrified. How did he get in? Why would he come back? Is this a scare tactic? I see my spare key I put back the day before is gone. I knew it was time to call the police again. I fill out a statement and they helped me talk to my leasing office to have the locks changed. While I am waiting for them to come change my locks, someone walks into my apartment. It was two friends of his. I tell them to leave but they say abuser left a backpack here they came to get it. I say take it give me my key and leave. They do. So I call police again to report that incident. Bruises are getting worse now and I take pictures as they turn colors etc. There was a clear handprint on my chest. The cops have now issued felony assault and menacing dv warrant.

Fast forward to this past Tuesday. His trial begins. He would not take any plea deals. I had to testify, and it was terrible. I was re-traumatized, humiliated and so nervous and anxiety ridden that I was physically sick. I know defense lawyers are there to protect their clients and my abuser was his client but what was said in that courtroom was disgusting and more insulting then anything. I felt like the jury believed me. They had some questions and I answered them and I felt good after it was over. His defense at trial was that we were never in a relationship and his friends got up and said the same thing. He may have hidden me from them and started pulling away at the end but we were in a relationship... even though we never had that conversation. He once locked himself out of my apartment and identified himself as such to my leasing office to get in.  He told me he loved me. Called me baby and we were sleeping and living together. I had submitted texts to prove this. They needed me to come back yesterday and I did. But abuser decides to take the stand. My victim advocate said he looked so bad up there that they didn't need me to testify after all and they send me home.

The jury came back and acquitted him of all charges. Well it was actually a hung jury that couldn't decide due to one man I am told that was not convinced we were together. Prosecutors apologize profusely saying it was a mistake not to put me back up there but after they juries reaction to his explanation they thought he was toast. Had I testified again, the evidence of our relationship would have been seen by the jury and I just feel like this would have ended a different way. 

I never wanted to go to trial, I never asked for any of the abuse. I never wanted to be here. I am absolutely gutted to the core. I found out about numerous other women he has done this to. He will do this again and again. Our justice system is so broken and I need to move on. But how do you move on when someone gets out of something like this and you know there will be someone else in your shoes later... And you tried so hard to prevent it. Thank you for reading this if you are still here and please leave any advice you have to get over the heartache something like this brings. I am definitely going to need therapy.",2022-06-24 18:50:44,2025-03-17 03:37:50,survivor

Our immigrant neighbors are in danger and the Executive Orders we have already seen and will continue to see will have impacts that are wide-ranging and devastating.

I am reaffirming what this sub is all about: safety and respect for survivors. Ableism, transphobia, homophobia, racism, misogyny, and xenophobia do not belong here. Period. Nor does telling anyone with a uterus who wants to seek an abortion that abortion is morally wrong (it isn't).

**Pro-woman means pro-feminism.** It does not mean that we justify the actions of female abusers nor negate abuse against men by women. Read the sidebar for the list of resources for male survivors and the rule that says ""No stating that only women can be abused and only men can be abusive.""

We have always done our absolute best to remove any content that endorses any of the above, and will continue to do so.

I 've been in an abusive relationship for more than 2 years, in my late teens. I escaped  nearly 3 years ago and since then went no contact with my ex.

I went to therapy, hypnosis. I also had 2 other relationships (non abusive ones) after this one. I think I improved a lot during the last 3 years and I'm overall happier and more peaceful.

However, a few days ago, I realised at least 2 friends of mine are still friends with my abuser. At first I didn't think it would bother me, but since then I can't sleep properly. I feel anxious again and feel I could no longer commit to any kind of relationship (even a true and deep friendship) even though I know good people exist (I'm single atm btw).

I feel very vulnerable again, probably because there is still a little link between my ex and me through these friends. I thought I wouldn't still be afraid of him after all this time but the reality is that I still fear him and what he would do if we were in the same room/place.

I'm just so tired to always be afraid of relationships, afraid of being hurt or abused, of being abandoned and especially tired to be afraid of him. Do you have some piece of advice for me to heal completely?

He was my first boyfriend, i lost my virginity to him, and I was head over heels in love. I thought he was perfect. A couple months in he ""caught"" me smoking weed - he showed up at my house after ignoring all my phone calls, the house reeked of weed and i was literally sitting on my bed naked after a shower. We hadnt been dating long and when he bursted in i tried to cover my naked body, he yanked the blanket off and started spanking me until i was bleeding. I was so caught off guard. I stayed with him for 3 years after this and indured so much abuse. I stayed because I was in love and life can be gray sometimes. I knew that he was making my life unbearable but I couldn't imagine life without him. He was all I had- that was his intention. When i finally left him for good i spent about 3 months crying over him- missing him, wanting him back. But thank god i never went to see him because it would have probably been right back to square one. We did text/call frequently and the truth is sometimes we still do. Weve been broken up for almost 1.5 years now, the past year has been one of the best of my life but i still call him sometimes. I know i shouldnt but i do. I do think a big part of it is wanting him to know how good my life is without him and then also because he was my first and only ""love."" 

I haven't loved anyone since him so far- but i have met some of the most amazing men. They helped change my thought process of ""i hate men"" & ""all men are bad."" I don't hate men any more.

tree5s,My mom is an abuse survivor - I never witnessed the abuse and am coming to terms with how it’s impacted my own life.,joblessinperth,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/tree5s/my_mom_is_an_abuse_survivor_i_never_witnessed_the/,"I’m 26 and my parents seperated when I was a week old. 

In short, my father is mentally ill and was extremely verbally and emotionally abusive to my mom who had a difficult pregnancy with me. Constantly screaming at her, accusing her of insane things, and a lot of other horrible stuff. She was on bed rest the later half of her pregnancy where she needed someone to care for her and my father would come home late, sometimes throwing an apple at her for dinner. 

The final straw was when I was a baby, he threatened her and told her to “watch her ass” before he left for work. She took that as a direct threat, packed up her things and me and moved back in with my grandparents and never went back. 

As I got older, my father forced her to court for visitation rights so I had to see him. I hated going. She always let my father have a relationship with me but also kept me safe. 

My whole life, this has just been normal to me and I’ve felt like he “has” to be in my life, like an obligation. But his mental problems have continued and worsened and he refuses to get help because all he needs is “Jesus.” I am the only person he hasn’t ostracized or left, and I’ve felt a lot of pressure to “fix” him….but lately, I realized that this isn’t my responsibility. 

Anyway, in therapy, I’ve noticed a pattern where I tend to go for guys who have issues and I’m wondering if this is linked to him. 

I never directly witnessed the abuse but I have been the one dealing with his craziness through the years. Weird comments and public outbursts and quite honestly, I’m sick of it and only talk to him because I feel sorry for him. 

In all honesty, I hate him for the way he treated my mom and it’s taken a long time to get enough distance to realize that this isn’t normal and he’s not just “weird.”

I go weeks without speaking to him and when I do, I have to force myself to answer the phone. Sometimes he guilts me for not speaking to him enough. But ignoring him is the only way I know how to draw a boundary, but it doesn’t solve the root of the problem. 

I want to give him an ultimatum in order to have a relationship with me: get professional help or lose me. I’m working through boundary setting etc in therapy but I’d appreciate any insight from this sub on navigating this and processing what happened.

I was never the kind of person that easily ""hates"" or ""hold grudges.""

Because I don't like the feeling of being angry, it hurts me and it's pointless. 

I always knew forgiving isn't about erasing that person's mistakes in their favor. It's about relieving the weight from those memories in YOUR favor.

That's how I deal with being bullied in the past, broken hearted and more.

But abuse is different.

I want that narcissist to trip over her own narcissism.

I want the girl who teamed with her instead of teaming with me, as she should have, to really regret it and realize the mistake she made in the worst way.

I want them both to be sorry, but being realistic, they never will. They were too blind to even respect me for once or recognize what they did.

Where do I shove this, basically? How do I ""forgive""? I'm angry and I have the right to be. But same to all kinds of anger, it's useless in the end. 

As I said, I'm almost never hateful. There are many people I could hate and I decide not to.

My abuser is different from me and hates a lot, by the way. She hates me now for stopping her blood-sucking.  It feeds her ego to believe how everyone else deserves her hate while she's so perfect and victmized.",2021-08-24 18:06:04,2025-03-17 03:38:06,survivor

taims0,Advice for partners of abuse survivors?,KillMariner,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/taims0/advice_for_partners_of_abuse_survivors/,"Hi all! I hope it is ok to post here. This is my first ever post on reddit, but I just don't know where else to go. My gf left an abusive marriage a couple years back (the divorce will be final so so soon!), and we started dating not long after (we have known each other for years but lost touch when her abuser worked to isolate her from her support network). She has done so much work on walking away, holding her boundaries, and learning to name the abuse, and I am UNBELIEVABLY proud of her.

My question for y'all is this: as a partner of a survivor and not the survivor myself, how can I deal with my own anger at my partner's abuser without making it my partner's problem? I hate her ex-wife so much it sometimes feels like I'm going to explode. I have worked really hard to keep this rage pointed firmly AWAY from my gf, and I am in therapy where I can talk about it more freely, but every time something new happens with her divorce proceedings or we hit a milestone in our own relationship, it kicks up all this emotional dust in the corners of my mind that is somehow both mine and not about me at all. I really love my gf and I don't want to spend the rest of our relationship periodically stewing in anger and helplessness, but the idea that anyone could treat someone I love so badly really messes me up.  I also find myself comparing myself to her abuser in a way I never do with the regular exes of people I date. I can't stand the idea that someone so horrible could be more attractive or more successful or have had a deeper initial connection with my gf than me. I feel like jealousy and anger don't get talked about much in spaces that are (correctly!) more focused on getting free of abusers and recovering internal self-worth.

Thoughts? Advice? Suggestions for a different forum I could post this in, because I really don't want to take up space here if it is meant for people more directly impacted by abuse?",2022-03-09 21:53:37,2025-03-17 03:38:09,survivor

Here is my survivor story.,East_Impact4101,29,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/malvxg/my_ex_is_48_im_19_and_we_started_dating_when_i/,"Hi, this is my story. Some info to start with. Im 19 a female and i live in US on the east coast. I wont say what state exactly bc safety! This story is from 2017-2020. So here goes...

When i was 16 i was a ward of the state due to my parents being horrible parents to me. I took my trauma from them and used it to gain attention from older men online. I met a man in December 2017 on an app meant for adult hookups, who i thought was attractive. Let’s call him C. C was a college professor in the US on the east coast. I was a 16 year old traumatized, abused girl looking to be loved by anyone. I ended up running away due to non related reasons and had asked C if i could stay a week or two until i could drift to my next place to hideout. He told me to stay as long as i would like because he was lonely etc etc. so i stayed for a week, then three weeks, then two months and so on. C constantly told me because of our age difference we would never date and that i was just staying there and we could be FWB. Well after being there for 5 months, C asked me to date him because he had caught feelings and so did i. We started dating and before long he had to go out West to see his two kids at his ex wifes house. During the summer of 2018 he left to see his kids and i watched the house. I had two friends of mine move in (with permission) and we started living together so i was less lonely. Well at that age i wasnt even 100% sure if C was being honest when he said he wanted to date. He was talking to women from all these states which he drove through all of them to get to the west. I also had found out he slept with his ex in our bed when i was living there and had visited my family. Well me being the stupid teen i was, i joined a popular dating app and started seeing other guys. I was in the wrong 100% because two wrongs dont make a right. I know this now but i didnt care back then. So my housemates ended up snitching because i wanted them gone. They were destroying mine and my exes house, stealing shit, i caught them trying to steal my limited edition R2D2 xbox 360 that didnt even work. So i told them they have 30 days to leave or i was calling the cops. So they decided to tell C of what i had done. He drove home drunk (oh yeah forgot to mention hes an alcoholic, even to this day) left his kids behind A WEEK EARLY (they dont speak to him bc of him leaving a week early and bc i cussed his baby momma out for trying to start shit with me) and burst through the front door and started calling out to me. I was hiding because i felt ashamed and disgusting for what i had done. How could i do something so terrible? He smashed my vape, took my phone, and didnt look at me or even want to be in the same room as me. The next day we started fighting and i walked out to go to the park and listen to music while swinging. As im walking farther away from the house i get a bad feeling in my gut, so i turn around and jog back to my house. The entire back of the house is pumping out plumes of black smoke. I run into the house and smell/hear a fucking fire. I go to our bedroom and the bed is completely engulfed in flames... i see a pile of clothes and thought it was C. I get into gear grab a bucket, while choking on smoke,to fill it with water in the kitchen. I run upstairs to see C carrying a fire extinguisher while smiling like a mad man. My housemates at this point are outside with their cat. I go out and ask what the fuck happened. They tell me that they heard what sounded like Lysol or something in an aerosol can. Then WHOOSH and the smoke. He comes down and says we can come in. He is shirtless and covered in soot. He ended up with second and third degree burns on his hands from trying to pat the fire out with the comforter. One day in August we were fighting and i said that i wanted to go back to placement and never see him again. I told him i wish he never got to see his kids again and he snapped. He started chasing me and we ended up outside because i was trying to get help. He threw me to the ground and started STRANGLING me! Not lightly choking not kinky choking like completely cutting off my airways until the point i saw my life flash before my eyes and i knew i would die and nobody would know or care. And i felt at peace knowing i was about to die. Little did we both know someone drove up the road and saw me and him rolling around in the dirt. They continued down the road turned around and arrived just in time for C to let go of me. The people in the car asked me something i think when i sat up. I dont really remember due to blacking out after sitting up. I remember waking up on the air mattress we had. C was laying next to me staring. He looked worried. I went to the bathroom not saying a word and looked in the mirror. I had a deep blueish purple mark on my neck... you could see each of his fingers where they had squeezed so tightly. I just looked at myself and cried. Sorry i sobbed. I sobbed because i felt broken. He kept apologizing to me and idk why but i forgave him. I forgave him because i loved him so much. Well C promised to change but he didnt. I was found by police and brought back to my state and was held in a residential facility until i was 18 (a year). C came and got me from my home state (he had moved to the west to start establishing stuff for when i got out) the day i turned 18 i left the system and left my homestate behind. We got engaged. I thought he had changed like he said he did. I thought it was for the best but it wasnt. Cs drinking got better from the last time i had seen him. But then he slowly digressed again. It was back to him hitting me, taking my stuff, breaking my stuff, and he would throw all of my belongings away. I stayed like that for another 7 months and finally i called it quits. He didnt have sex with me, wouldnt cuddle me or anything to be connected and close to me. I had found out he was meeting up with his coworker from Starbucks and he and she would drink, get drunk and i caught then holding hands and being unfaithful (she was also dating an older guy but tried to take my man, lets say my home state is a tough one. And she fucked with the wrong one. Dont fuck with the girl whose daddy taught her to fight grown men ;) ) so i caught them and that was the end for me. I packed my shit and travelled to a beautiful city and stayed in a hotel. He then said he wanted to try and make it work one more time. My dumb ass fell for it. I went back to our apartment with him and not even two days later we get into a fight, he puts his hands on me, and i decked him in the chin and in the ballsack. I then grabbed the phone i had purchased after he took my other one, my purse and wallet and made sure my ID and shit were inside (he would take my debit cards, he destroyed my birth certificate and ATE one of my social security cards) when i tried getting my service dog ready to take with me he grabbed the leash from me and told me i couldnt take MY dog. The dog he didnt even want. I then went to a friends, got a bus ticket to my Aunts house in the mid west, got my own apartment and job in less than a month. I then ended up suicidal and had a breakdown. So i packed my bags went to Ohio to catch a train to my homestate and never looked back. Now im in a new relationship with a guy who is around my age (im 19 hes 23) and we live happy with our four cats and his family. Im trying to move past that part of my life. 

Thank you for allowing me to share my story. Ive been through alot. I wasnt handed the best cards in life but im making the most out of what i got. 

Stay strong everyone, sincerely, Some stranger of the internet.",2021-03-22 12:02:36,2025-03-17 03:38:16,survivor

So, I was in a bad DV situation for a long time in a small town in the middle of nowhere. I finally was able to leave and I went to the nearest city. I kept calling DV shelters, but none had a bed open. So I decided to leave the state and go far away to start my life over somewhere new. I got to the new state and couldn't get into a DV shelter because they said I ""wasn't considered DV anymore because I got myself away""... Ok... Then I got told I don't qualify for the state's DV rehousing grant because I don't have kids (requirement )... So I ended up in a homeless shelter. The homeless shelter refuses to believe I was in DV because ""too many homeless girls lie about it"" and because ""I seem to be adjusting too well""... Ooookkkk... Then they called me ""judgemental "" because I am having a hard time interacting with other residents because I don't do drungs or drink (I only smoke cigarettes) and I'm not interacting with the other residents like they are my ""friends"" (they are all just stealing from each other and lying to and about each other). Staff and the other residents act like I am lying about everything in my past because of ""how I turned out"" (meaning I'm not strung out or etc), lying everything I am currently saying, etc, and keep intentionally giving me horrible advice and making promises they don't intend to keep, they (staff and residents) are making fun of me/my situation, they make fun of where I'm from, and they are hoping to sabotage anything good I have going for me. Since I've left him almost 2 months ago now, I've been told that I dont even qualify as DV anymore, yet I feel I never got the healing and help I needed to begin with!! I have no family, a friend back home but they can't help. I'm beside myself and massively depressed. What do I do??",2025-03-17 04:46:32,2025-03-17 15:34:15,help

He threatened to break up if I don’t have my location on. Checked my pictures yesterday.

He won’t share his location and gets irrationally offended when I even ask him if he is seeing someone else. I’m not allowed to call because he gets “triggered” because I called him 30 times one time because I found him on a dating app. 
ew just writing this makes me feel gross. 

He also has a huge alcohol problem. 

Anyways, he didn’t text me back at all after 5:45pm. He’s claiming that he fell asleep early. TBH my gut is telling me he got super hammered and fell asleep. Nonetheless, there’s this pattern of him ignoring me, not  texting back (even when he initiates) and I’ve told him it bothers me. 
I have no clue how he again made this about him. 

Can someone tell me if they see any signs of manipulation, emotional abuse or just any red flags.

After this first night he was very active and openly interested in pursuing things, we texted everyday, he responds very quickly to texts and we saw each other constantly, couldn't really stay away from eachother, that honeymoon phase feeling.fast track a few months and I was moving to a different city for 6 months as was planned before I met him. He is very temperamental and openly admits that he has issues with anger and is difficult. He doesn't like kissing in general and we never really ""french kiss"" even during sex, we also don't really have much affection otherwise, I put this down to a cultural thing. I am always a bit worried going out with him because I feel like if the slightest thing is wrong with his food, table, drink, whatever, he will throw a temper tantrum. 

I feel like he always needs things to go his way or he will be annoyed, but he also gets over the annoyance rather quickly. Everything got escalated after for unexpected reasons I couldn't stay in the flat in the new city and had to move in with him as where I live it's a very difficult renting situation. The first week living here there was a party where we all drank to much and we had an argument, and he threw my phone at me which cut my lip pretty badly. He apologised that night, drunk, when I threatened to leave but never brought it up apologetically again sober. around the house there are also holes in the wall where he has lost his temper and punched a while (mind not due to me at least yet).

He hasn't intentionally meant to hurt me but for the first 4 months of our relationship he was pinching me and biting me ""playfully"" but doing it really hard and I told him many many times to stop because it hurt, after some months he finally did. He is very selfish with what we do and he doesn't want to compromise on what music we listen to, movies we watch, sex he makes all about him and his needs. If we watch a movie I like he won't concentrate on it, talk through the whole thing or goes on his phone. 

It sounds all doom and gloom but we do also have a good time together cooking and sometimes laughing together, he says I am the love of his life and we should buy a house etc. he is very organised with cleanliness and finances and part of the reason I fell for him was this mundane security I felt he had in control which alot of my exes didn't have.

but something doesn't really feel right here.. he speaks to me in a really angry tone of voice most of the time kind of like ""why did you do that stupid thing"" type of way which I have told him to stop, but it seems to just be his nature.. he never asks me questions or seems interested in my stories or thoughts and it's lonely for someone talkative like me.

Now the possibility has arisen for me to get a flatshare with a family member and I have been looking at flats.. I am scared how he would react to me moving out so I thought I will not tell him until I have confirmed somewhere and then I will let him know calmly that for me this was too soon to move in together, but if he is willing to work on some of these worrying qualities we could still try to date. 

He also told me the other day while he was annoyed at something and apologising for the night before that he had been to therapy for 6 months to work on his anger and it was worse before. I appreciate anyone working on themselves but this also worried me. I don't feel much empathy from him, it seems he is very him first, he wants the comfier seat everytime at the restaurant, he wants to pick the movie we watch at the cinema with my friends etc. He swears alot and jokes about violence, and eating my pet rabbit and jokes about her alot but he also feeds her and cleans her cage etc so might just put that down to insensitive humour.

I feel terribly guilty looking at flats and thinking about moving behind his back, especially because he got me flowers and a nice jewelry for Valentine's Day but I'm trying to tell myself to focus on the bigger picture. He also kicked his previous girlfriend out of the house and I cannot take that risk as I have nowhere to go if this happens because I have a pet.

1. Attraction/ obsession with a certain unhealthy body type and wanting you to stay that body type forever (example- unhealthily skinny or overweight) 
2. Keeps track on all the women he has slept with as trophies, has lists with their names or full on notebooks with contacts
3. Ageism. Saying things like ""women at 25 are already expired"", constantly searching for barely legal girls for sexual escapades and borderline paedophilic preferences.
4. Financial restriction, even if it's regarding your own money. You might end up hiding receipts and feeling guilty for a certain purchase. 
5. Inclination to force non-monogamy, even if that makes you uncomfortable and was said numerous times. Also, non-monogamy that only suits him and involves multiple women.
6. Bullshit excuses such as, ""men will always want to fuck as much as possible""; ""it's in our DNA"" and ""we need to spread the seed""
7. Hate for the non-sexual bodily functions of women, such as menstruating
8. Substance abuse. I don't know why this is still such a taboo, I am pretty liberal myself ( I am okay with recreational drug use from time to time) and I still think that when a substance is used everyday to the point of addiction, well that is an atmosphere for abuse. 
9. They cheated with you, they cheated on previous partners or wanted you to leave an existing relationship for them. 
10. Treating women as disposable and thinking it's a ""cool"" and ""macho"" behaviour.",2022-01-08 15:15:01,2025-03-17 16:31:11,signs

Stalking

Asking for money/place to stay too early in the relationship

PHYSICAL ATTACKS

Verbal attacks on your looks, sexuality, past

Blaming everyone in their own life

Using excessive social media and addiction to pornography

Changing life-story to fit your personal views

Threats

1fmknkp,is this a bad sign? ,noimportaaaa,5,25,https://i.redd.it/sgxyrbvdbaqd1.jpeg,"Me and this person only been talking for like a week or so and today was the first time we talked consistently about what we expect and what we want out of us talking. I’ve made it clear. I want to take it slow because of past situations, but I don’t know if it’s safe to proceed. It seems like he’s trying too quickly for me. I didn’t know he was only talking to me and we are not dating. We literally just met. And I feel myself becoming anxious and trying to appease him. That’s why I haven’t been looking for anything serious. And when we started texting, he was already muted as if I had texted him before and for some reason muted his notifications, but I couldn’t find any past messages from him in my phone. I can’t tell if he’s just trying to take me serious or if he’s…abusive 🤷🏾‍♀️ I literally have never been able to tell. And it’s probably dumb but I test myself by saying every once in a while to see if I can catch red flags. This seems like one. Our morals and goals match or whatever on paper but…anybody can say anything. So I have to look beyond that. I’ve been in abusive relationship after abusive relationship and I just don’t know how to spot the signs I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub to post in. ",2024-09-22 04:01:47,2025-03-17 16:31:21,signs
1ixb675,what does ‘supply’ or ‘new supply’ mean? what are the signs your ex is a narcissist?,Substantial-Mud-46,0,4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ixb675,"i can’t tell if mine is or not, but a lot of people in my life including my therapist have said he is.. 

not sure if this helps, but this was our conversation from yesterday (and yes, i know i shouldn’t want him to come back for like the third time)

what does supply also mean? keep saying that word used a lot here. 

and no, he didn’t block me. he never does when he says he will. if he ever does, it only lasts an hour. 

i didn’t reply to his last message, but i did call him last night before i went to sleep at my friends house as it was stressing me out. as soon as he answered he said i was just thinking about you. i said i was too and those texts from earlier were stressing me out. we started talking about random stuff like his brother and stuff. i then said i miss you. i think he said it back but i can’t remember. he said ill speak to you later then that was it 

i really hope he comes back, but im scared this is the final discard. and yes i keep breaking no contact, breakup has been two months and longest i’ve gone is 2.5 days and i promise every time ill give him space but i cant do it. it’s like im addicted to him. despite how he’s been speaking to me. 

i can’t help but feel like this is all my fault. i was so needy and insecure in the relationship, and im being even worse during this breakup. which makes me think the way he speaks to me is deserved. ",2025-02-24 19:52:55,2025-03-17 16:31:22,signs

I’m a 26-year-old woman, and I’ve been with my partner (26M) for almost three years. Lately, I’ve noticed some concerning changes in how he handles conflict, and I’m worried this could be a sign that our relationship is heading in a dangerous direction.

Over the past four to six months, he has completely lost the ability to stay calm during arguments. He shakes with anger, shuts down, and places all the blame on himself—saying things like, “I guess I’m just a horrible partner; this is all my fault.” He also yells at me violently and has thrown things in frustration (though not at me and not intentionally). He hasn’t hit a wall or become physically aggressive toward me, but his reactions still worry me—especially because we have a son, and he’s behaved this way in front of him.

I’m scared this could escalate, and I’m also confused because we never used to fight like this. I don’t want to just walk away without understanding what’s happening, but I also don’t want to ignore red flags. For those who have experienced abusive relationships, does this sound like the beginning of one? I’d really appreciate any insight or advice.",2025-02-10 19:01:03,2025-03-17 16:31:26,signs

There was a celebration at their house and I was staying at his room when I realized I might not be able to graduate in time so I started to get stressed and was on the verge of breaking down. He entered the room (he had already been drinking for a couple of hours) and asked me to come out multiple times and I calmly expressed that I feel stressed out with academics. On his third attempt to ask me to come out of his room, he finally lost it. He started pointing his finger while saying I’m the worst for ruining the celebration for him. Long story short, I started crying so much because I don’t do too well with harsh words (which I’ve told him about hundreds of times already) but he still continued.

He then proceeded to throw his vape on the floor, his glasses, and he threw his new phone at his laptop and it almost broke. He then proceeded to tell me it was all my fault. He then started hitting himself and I was crying so hard while telling him “please stop, love”. But he kept hitting himself again and again. And he repeatedly kept saying i’m the worst person while pushing my temple with his finger.

Are those signs that if i let it slide, he will eventually become more violent?

🚩 Excessive calling when I was out with friends. Keeping track of my social media
🚩 Getting angry and giving me attitude if I didn't pick up his phone call RIGHT away just to accused me of talking to other men online
🚩Jealousy about ANY men in my life. Demanding to block and remove my ex phone number. Getting angry when I just looked at someone at a grocery store
🚩 Violent short temper. Yelling in my face, punching couch. 
🚩 Not letting me leave, shoving me, slapping my hands and telling me that wasn't hitting. 

And while all this was happening, I had no idea I was being emotionally abused. Luckily I left him.

How many do you identify of your ex or current partner? 

COMMON SIGNS ABUSE:

* Your partner keeps track of everything you do. They monitor where you are and who you are with at all times. They prevent or discourage you from seeing friends, family, or going to work or school.

* Your partner insists that you reply right away to their texts, emails, and calls, and demands to know your passwords to social media sites, email, and other accounts.

* An abusive partner may act jealous, including constantly accusing you of cheating. They may attempt to control how you spend money and your use of medications or birth control. They may make everyday decisions for you, such as what you wear or eat.

* They may be demeaning. They may put you down by insulting your appearance, intelligence, or interests. They may try to humiliate you in front of others and attempt to destroy your property or things that you care about.

* An abusive partner may act angry or have a quick or unpredictable temper, so you never know what might cause a problem. They may blame you for their violent outbursts and physically harm or threaten harm to you, themselves, and members of your household, including children or pets.

* They may hurt you physically, such as hitting, beating, pushing, shoving, punching, slapping, kicking, or biting. They may use or threaten to use a weapon against you.

* They may be sexually abusive, including rape or other forced sexual activity. They may incorrectly assume that consent for a sex act in the past means that you must participate in the same acts in the future. They may also incorrectly assume that consent for one activity means consent for increased levels of intimacy. For example, an abuser may assume that a kiss should lead to sex every time.

* An abusive partner may threaten to turn you in to authorities for illegal activity if you report the abuse, or if you resist.",2024-11-30 05:39:41,2025-03-17 16:31:34,signs

I sent him a message after work saying if it happens again, I will take action, and it resulted in the above messages. 
My friends are concerned that he’s been abusing me emotionally and psychologically, but I don’t think that’s the case. He doesn’t check many of the boxes for examples of abuse.

I really wanted to get this off my chest, because I saw a video of a girl reacting to a street interview where guys where asked if they should have a say in what their gfs wear, she commented saying “If you don’t care about his opinion, why date him?” and “If it’s for yourself, why don’t you wear that at home?”

For all women who were in a similar situation and were made to believe that they are disrespecting their boyfriends or whatever, it was NEVER about just the clothing. It usually starts with such remarks because it is a gateway into other forms of control. I guarantee you, he doesn’t stop at just what you’re wearing. Today it’s that, tomorrow it’s isolation from your friends because of their “questionable morals” then the day after tomorrow it’s you not being able to leave your house.

Don’t let ANYONE tell you that this is about respect, it is absolutely not. You respect your partner by staying loyal, committed, putting in the necessary effort and by listening to his needs. One of these should NEVER include you tossing your warderobe away.

Think about this further, he doesn’t want you wearing certain things, because what? Because he doesn’t want you to attract other men. Because why? He thinks you want to. Because why? He thinks you’re a whore who seeks other men’s attention.

You will never convince me that it isn’t that, even on a subconcious level. 

These types of things REEK of abuse and they REEK of isolation and emotional drainage. 

Your partner is not your father, not your guardian, not anyone you need to sacrifice your autonomy for, even if it’s just to “cover up”",2024-11-27 17:21:36,2025-03-17 16:31:37,signs

1ealm3g,Red Flags & Warning Signs of an Abuser,Think-Library9577,41,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ealm3g/red_flags_warning_signs_of_an_abuser/,"As a survivor who's been free from my abuser for two years now, I believe it’s vital to help other victims recognize the red flags that present themself in the early stages of an abusive relationship. Hopefully, this list will help someone escape before abuse escalates, or it will give them insight as to what they should look out for in a future partner. I’ve compiled a list of some warning signs that I find important to have on your radar:

**Red Flags**

* *They have crappy friends.* “You are who you hang around”. If someone has little-to-no friends, or their friends are disrespectful with no real life goals- it goes to show the influences someone has in their life. Who we know affects who we become, so make sure your partner has friends in their life who are kind and have aspirations.
* *They speak negatively about others.* If someone is constantly bringing others down, pointing out “flaws” in random rangers, or bringing up drama, that’s a good indication of their heart. My ex would often make jokes about overweight people in public, and although I didn’t think it was funny, he’d say “it’s just a joke” . If someone is degrading someone else for their lifestyle, interests, or appearance, that shows very narcissistic behavior. Also, if they’re talking negatively about strangers, their closest friends, or their family- they *will* talk shit about you.
* *They constantly brag about how good of a person they are*. My ex would always talk about himself and the “good deeds'' he'd do. If he left a generous tip for a waitress, you can assure he would be posting about it on Snapchat. If he went to visit his elderly grandmother, that was something that he felt the world needed to know about. Chances are, if someone is bragging about how good of a person they are, they’re actually not that good of a person. No one brags about something they do in everyday life; so if they’re showing off an act of kindness, it’s because it’s rare.
* *They start being emotionally abusive*. Emotional abuse is typically the first step in DV relationships. If your partner is demonstrating speech/behavior that is degrading, belittling, controlling, punishing, or manipulative towards you, you need to exit safely as soon as possible. Abusers may start out by withholding love, refusing to speak to you, looking through your phone any chance they get, calling you names, or doing anything that tears you down. Regardless if they apologize afterwards, that doesn’t make it right. These are ways in which narcissists control and maintain power over their partner. When someone tries to control where you go, who you talk to, or what you think, they are disrespecting your right to autonomy. They’re tearing you down little by little so that they can feel bigger about themself.
* *They’re jealous*. At the beginning of a relationship, an abuser will always say that jealousy is a sign of love; jealousy has nothing to do with love, it is a sign of possessiveness and lack of trust. They may question you about who you talk to, accuse you of flirting, or be jealous of the time you spend with family or friends. As the jealousy progresses, they may call frequently during the day or drop by unexpectedly. Your partner may even try to justify this behavior by saying they are concerned with your safety or they are “just looking out for you”. 
* *They invade your life very quickly.* If your partner is wanting to spend every day together, talking about marriage, kids, moving in, etc after only a short while together, that’s a huge red flag. They are pressuring you to commit to the relationship in such a way that you may later feel guilty or like you are letting them down if you want to slow down or break up. They’re trying to establish permanence in your life so it’s harder for you to get rid of them. 
* *They have little work ethic.* It’s important to look for a partner who has long term goals and dreams. If their mother still coddles them as an adult, they do nothing productive all day, or they have no desire to do anything that isn’t fun for them- they are going to continue that behavior in your relationship. Eventually, you’ll become the one taking care of them and their needs. My ex did everything impulsively and without a solid plan, just “hoping for the best”. (I’m not saying impulsive decisions are bad, but when it’s *every single time,* that’s a huge red flag!) He was unprepared for almost everything he got himself into, so I constantly had to take time away from what I was doing to save him. If you see that they’re not prepared for life, don’t stay. You’ll just end up being a parent rather than a partner.
* *They’re impatient.* Look at how your partner behaves when they don't get their way. An abusive person will push until they get what they want, but a good person understands boundaries and will respect someones “no"". This can be more difficult to notice in the beginning stages of a relationship, as an abuser will try to hide their emotions in the start. Pay attention to how they treat staff at restaurants, or how they speak to their mother on the phone. If they get irritable when things don’t go their way, that’s a clear indication of how they will treat you. 
* *They don’t deal with their emotions*. It’s important to see how someone you’re in a relationship with handles conflict. Do they run away and go silent? Do they get angry and lash out? Do they actively try to address their traumas and issues? If your partner can’t handle negative emotions, then chances are that they will take their feelings out on you. 
* *They say horrible things about their exes*. My ex said awful things about his ex girlfriends for no reason. He would call his exes names like: ugly wh\*res, sl\*ts, c\*nts, stupid b\*tches, etc. and say how he wanted them to die. The thing is, your ex was once someone you loved. That was someone you saw a future with... So unless your ex abused you or was legitimately crazy, why would you say such nasty things about them? My ex consistently brought up how crazy his past girlfriend was. When I was trying to escape him years later, I actually ended up contacting the “crazy ex”, and she was one of the sweetest girls ever who went through the same things I did. (Years later, she’s now one of my best friends). 
* *They don’t like your friends/family*. If your partner makes remarks or smear tactics about how they don’t like your friends or family, what they’re trying to do is isolate you from the people in your life. If I had plans with my friends, my ex would guilt me into not going nearly every time. It got to the point where I stopped being invited out because my friends assumed I wouldn’t be able to go. This is a tactic used by abusers to make it seem like your partner is your only support and no one else cares for you. If someone doesn’t love the people you love, they don’t belong in your life.
* *Your friends/family dont like them*. If the people in your life who know you most and want the best for you do not like your partner, that’s a clear indication that you have on “rose colored glasses”. Sometimes, we struggle to see who someone really is deep down because we develop an emotional attachment. So listen to what your friends say about your partner, because they’ll look at them for what they are while you’re looking at them for what you love. If your closest allies think your significant other isn’t worth the time of day, chances are they’re right. 
* *They don't share the same morals as you.* Shared values provide a set of guidelines that establish respect, resolve conflicts, and help make important decisions with your partner. It’s fine to disagree on some things, but couples should see eye-to-eye on major topics. Abusers either won’t share similar morals with you, or they’ll just have no morals. Talk about the things you care deeply about early on.
* *They downplay your accomplishments*. If someone who is supposed to love you makes you feel guilty after you share good news with them, run. If they try to talk about their own achievements to take away from your moment, they’re trying to diminish what you’ve done in order to belittle you. I remember when I graduated Salutatorian from my private highschool with honors and a 4.2 GPA, my ex told me “It’s highschool, not rocket science. Anyone could do that if they just paid attention.” He didn’t even show up to my graduation. (Mind you, I was taking multiple college courses. He dropped out of highschool his senior year and got his GED at 21). He made me feel guilty for being proud of myself. No one should make you feel bad for reaching your goals. Your partner should be your biggest supporter.
* *They make empty promises*. Abusers like to make promises to their victims without any intention of ever fulfilling them. They tend to make promises when they feel they are not in control so as to give them power over something in your life. It’ll start out with little things like “I’m going to take you to this nice restaurant” or “I promise to bring you flowers soon” so that they can get your hopes up, but they’ll never actually follow through with their word. Eventually, these promises will turn into “I’m sorry for what I said, I promise I won’t do it again” or “I promise I’ll never lay another hand on you, I feel awful about it”. This is all a ploy to keep you from leaving them.
* *They break/strike things*. Abusers often will first show how they react when angered by taking it out on the objects around them. This behavior can be used as a punishment by breaking possessions you love, but is mostly used to terrorize you into submission. The abuser may beat on the table with their fists, throw objects at/near you, kick the car, slam doors, or drive at a high speed recklessly to scare you. Not only is this a sign of extreme emotional immaturity, but there is great danger when someone thinks they have the “right” to punish or frighten you.

If this list can help save even one person, I’ve done my job here. I encourage others to share any red flags they noticed in their own experiences in the comments. It’s important to tell our stories in order to end the culture of silence and illuminate a safer path.

",anonykitcat,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hg7lns/are_these_signs_of_control_or_are_they_a/,"It can be challenging for me to tell whether the following are signs of control or signs that he is trying to look out for/protect my safety and well-being. What makes me think that there are aspects of control here is the fact that he can have episodes of verbal/emotional abuse (involving: shouting/yelling, name-calling, sometimes throwing things). This doesn't happen all the time, but it can happen every few weeks or months.

* We live in a not-so-great part of town currently, so it's not a great idea for a woman to go walking alone at night. I can see the logic here, but sometimes if we have a heated argument or fight where he's shouting at me, I want to leave the apartment for a bit (even at night). He tells me not to leave at night and will get very upset if I do, saying it's not safe for me.
* He often says I am too skinny (joking about how I look like a stick/teenage boy), and tries to get me to eat more. He says it's for my health/well-being, which I can understand. However, sometimes we have gotten into arguments because he gets mad at me for not eating enough, even though I am genuinely full. He also tells me that I would be more attractive to me if I gain weight, which is *very* hard when you are naturally slender (most of the women in my family are) and have a low appetite.
* He wants me to shave/wax frequently, and I generally don't mind it, but sometimes it's exhausting and takes too much time/effort so I'll get lazy (I also have a chronic health condition making basic tasks like shaving exhausting sometimes) and shave my legs and armpits once/week and brazillian wax every few months. I also nick myself shaving a lot, and waxing gets really expensive. He's always telling me that I need to ""groom"" myself more and jokes that I'm hairy like a man.
* He has expressed that he wouldn't want me to wear certain clothes (shorts that are too short, tops too low-cut, etc). I don't like wearing these clothes either (I feel uncomfortable getting attention from random men), but I feel like if I did want to, he'd have a problem with it.
* He has a certain style that he prefers and wants me to dress. He does not *force* me to dress this way, but often expresses how he wishes I did.
* We got several arguments because I didn't want to shave my head again (I was experiencing some hair loss). I had done it before and he liked it (he thinks bald women are attractive and complimented me a lot), but then I decided I wanted to grow my hair out. He also didn't like that my hair was shedding; it grossed him out to see my hair on the ground (I vacuum/sweep twice a week, but there's still hair sometimes) and he thought if I shaved it, the problem would be solved.
* He tells me ""come here"" a lot, and if I'm in the middle of doing something (studying, cleaning, watching something on my computer, etc) he will keep saying ""come here"" with increasing irritation in his voice. He will get annoyed if I don't come and sometimes argue with me. It's often because he wants attention, but sometimes he wants help or to talk with me about something.
* He needs a lot of attention and sometimes distracts me when I need to study for my graduate program. Even if he knows I'm studying, he will sometimes make random comments or jokes, and when I ignore them he sometimes feels insulted and gets irritated. Sometimes the frequent need for attention is exhausting and I just want to be in my own world for a bit.
* He guit-trips me about making certain decisions. For example, in a long-distance relationship, I was planning to visit him in his country of origin but there was a war. I told him I was scared to go there because there were warnings against travel due to a missile strike (which ended up happening at the same time that my plane was scheduled to land), and he told me the warnings meant nothing and were over-exaggerated and threatened to dump me if I cancelled the trip.
* He does not like wearing condoms and complains about wearing them if we have sex while I'm ovulating (I am not on birth control due to health issues). He thinks I'm overreacting and the pull-out will be fine, but I want to take the extra caution.
* If I am having a conflict with a family member or friend and I vent to him about it, he will tell me how I should respond/handle the situation. Often his preferred style of handling things/responding (which often involves setting very strong boundaries and being extremely direct, sometimes telling people straight-up to f\*\*k off) is different than mine. He will get frustrated and sometimes angry with me if I don't respond or handle a situation the way he thinks I should.
* When we are apart, he calls me frequently throughout the day and wants to know where I am/what I'm doing. I don't necessarily think this in itself is controlling, but he keeps frequent tabs on my activities/location. He sometimes can get paranoid that I'm cheating.
* He gets anxious about the idea of me communicating with any male classmates/colleagues. He doesn't force me not to, but he also does not like the idea of me having male friends so I generally try to avoid all unnecessary communication with unrelated men.",2024-12-17 10:12:51,2025-03-17 16:31:42,signs

-increased therapy to twice weekly

-admitted his behavior was abusive, that it was his choice, and that no behavior on my part should have ever led to that

-admitted he put me in a position to become codependent and only focus on his needs

-asked to apologize to my family in person

-respected my boundaries, has not been contacting me without asking permission/if it's a good time

-he has asked if I would give him another opportunity to prove himself.  He said he is committed to me and is willing to go as slow as I need over the next year or however long I would like

He's never physically hurt me, just acted intimidating throws things and puts my in vulnerable situations (ditching me places kicking me out of our house at night).  He has never been verbally demeaning.  He has never been unfaithful.

He has had a LOT of chances already, but this is the biggest blow up we have ever had and the only time I've ever actually left.

I'm not doing well without him.  I want our life back so badly.

Did any of your friends and family see the signs and try to warn you? Was there anything that anyone who loved you could have said that would have helped you leave earlier? 

My 19 year old daughter has been in a relationship for a year with a manipulative, emotionally abusive, narcissist. It hasn't turned physical yet, but he's told her that are needs to stop speaking to and being around me (I called him out for being verbally and emotionally abusive to her and that was his response... that I'm manipulative and she needs to get away from me). 

I didn't see the signs until recently. However, absolutely everyone around her sees the signs... friends, relatives, her therapist... even her! She admits that she knows he's abusive but she ""just loves him and can't explain why."" Her therapist explained that she's trauma bonded to him and that it's like a drug and that she's hoping that one day it will go back to the way it was in the very beginning. My daughter thinks she can end things peacefully. 

Every day she says she's done with him because of how he talks to her, but he manipulates her into going back every night. She says every day, ""I should just block him,"" but she never does, and she keeps going back. I'm afraid for her future. Unfortunately, she doesn't want any advice at all. She thinks she can just handle it on her own, except she has proven every day for the past month that she can't break free. She's had several people who are close to her who have been mentally and physically abused.... she refuses to listen to any of them. Everyone, including her therapist, tells me that she's just going to have to learn the hard way. I know that women often stay in physically abusive relationships for 7 to 12 years. I don't want that for my daughter. It breaks my heart to see her constantly go back after some of the absolutely horrible things he's said to her. I can't imagine anyone thinking that deserve to be treated like that. I can't imagine continually allowing someone to talk to me the way that he talks to her. 

Is there anything at all that I can say, or do, to get her to open her eyes to the fact that her only option is to block him on everything and just start the healing process? Or is she simply doomed to a miserable life with an abusive asshole?",2024-06-01 09:05:50,2025-03-17 16:31:46,signs

1dw8dfn,Seeing signs of abusive behavior in autistic chronically ill girlfriend,bigcoatsmallworld,13,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1dw8dfn/seeing_signs_of_abusive_behavior_in_autistic/,"TW: >!Suicide and self harm !<

I(M/25) am feeling worried because it has recently come to my attention that several behaviors that I thought were intrinsic aspects of my partners conditions are considered abusive and I'm having trouble understanding if my gf(24/F) is lying to me to take advantage of me or suffering and in legitimate need of help.

We have been dating for 2 years and currently live together. My gf is autistic and has frequent meltdowns over sensory issues and plans changing. Her meltdowns can get very explosive depending on the situation. Usually she goes non verbal when melting down, but we developed a strategy for me to help her communicate. Sometimes my gf doesn't cooperate with the strategy which leaves me kind of powerless to help aside from things like turning off the lights, making sure she's comfortable, etc. Often when this happens she is insistent that I help her and if I don't help her the right way her meltdown will escalate, when they escalate usually she will scream, stomp, throw things, yell at me, throw herself into walls, hit herself in the head, and try to swallow a handful of whatever pills are nearby. I have no idea how no one has called the police as we live in an apartment complex with thin walls, but every time this happens I worry that the police will get called.

My gf also has a chronic condition that gives her mobility issues and chronic pain. I have restructured my own life to be able to help her with this as it is pretty severe. I do almost all of the house hold chores, I drive her anywhere she needs to go, I take care of her dog, and generally assist however I can. As a result of this I hardly have any time for myself. I used to see friends multiple times a week and now I have gone months without seeing them. I used to have a full time job, now I work part time and hardly make enough money. I am generally too exhausted or anxious to talk to friends online or take care of myself. Recently my sister reached out to me to tell me she was worried about me because I don't seem like myself anymore and that she is concerned because she was recently in a toxic relationship and didn't want me to follow the same path. This prompted me to start reading about abusive relationships and I felt uneasy that I recognized some of the signs in my relationship.

My gf has mentioned before that some of her behaviors could seem abusive if they were done by a neurotypical person, but they're not an abusive person they just have more needs. In my attempts to research the correlation between autism and abuse I found an overwhelming sentiment that autism is never a valid excuse for abusive behavior. I have since set a boundary that if she starts to yell at me or throw/slam things during a meltdown I will leave the room to protect my peace. She got upset when I set this boundary and left our apartment threatening suicide. Later she told me she was happy I was learning to set boundaries but upset that this would mean she wouldn't get the support they need from me during a meltdown. Since I have started utilizing this boundary she has been very unhappy and calling it unfair.

I have also noticed if I do or say something she doesn't like she often shuts down and won't participate in my attempts to talk about what is wrong. Recently she did this to me because I asked for 2 hours to myself, after about an hour and a half she started asking for me to spend time with her instead, I insisted that I was going to use all of those 2 hours to myself as I rarely get the chance. Around bed time she got upset with me and moved to the couch, I fell asleep and kept waking up throughout the night to check on her, ask if she wanted to talk, tell her I could see something was bothering her, but she kept telling me nothing was wrong. Then in the morning she broke down about how horrible I was to her for ignoring her when she needed help and that I must not care about her because she said she was going to kill herself and I just went back to sleep. I do not remember her saying she was going to kill herself at all and am worried this is gaslighting, but can't say for sure because maybe I just didn't hear her.

I feel like I'm walking on eggshells because she regularly seems to be on the brink of a meltdown. I have to be super careful to make sure that nothing remotely stressful happens to her. This leads to me being fearful of relaying any stressful information such as problems in the relationship or asking for anything I need that alters our usual routine.

When she is ramping up to a meltdown she will start demanding my help with things. I try to help but it's not always clear what she needs or how I can help. If I ask for more information or don't figure it out she gets more and more upset until it's a full on meltdown and she's yelling at me for causing it. I told her I feel like I've become responsible for regulating her emotions as a result of this, she instantly dismissed this and told me this isn't true and that I'm being mean for suggesting it.

She has issues with almost all of my friends and family. She told me how she sees signs of things she doesn't like and doesn't feel comfortable being around a lot of them. This has contributed to me feeling isolated.

She also has been sexually coercive throughout the relationship. About halfway through our relationship I started wanting sex less often(about once a week, down from 2-3 times) and she would get really upset. Any time I said I wasn't in the mood she would guilt trip me and tell me that sex is how she feels loved and me not wanting sex feels like I'm rejecting her. She would be go silent and make it obvious she was upset. As a result I often have sex despite not wanting to.

She has threatened/attempted suicide multiple times in our relationship and has told me that if I leave her or stop taking care of her she will kill herself. I feel like I can't leave her because I honestly don't think she could manage her conditions by herself and am worried she will kill herself.

For a lot of these behaviors I have just accepted it and thought to myself, this is how she operates because her brain works differently and I need to try harder to understand her or her life is more challenging due to her disability and I have been happy to try and help her. Though lately I'm starting to wonder if I'm being taken advantage of and if she's manipulating me. I also worry because as I've become more aware of abuse/manipulation tactics and tried to stand up for myself and set boundaries, the more we get into situations where she tells me I'm being abusive to her. This is making me feel crazy because I know that that in itself could be another manipulation tactic, but at the same time I wonder if I'm treating her unfairly because I am over analyzing everything and treating her as if she's being abusive when she's not? She has had meltdowns that seriously caused problems for herself so I don't think they're entirely superficial. It definitely seems like her meltdowns are really intense and maybe I just need to be less involved.

I don't know if it's fair to call any of this behavior abusive, but I'm seeking clarity and wanted to get opinions from others, especially folks with autism or chronic illness about how this sounds, if anyone else has been in a similar situation.",2024-07-05 21:01:05,2025-03-17 16:31:52,signs

But one thing that was present was this feeling of isolation done in subtle ways, so Im gonna give a few examples of what happened to me and would like to hear from you as well.

One thing that was blatant was obv disencouraging my friendships with other women. For that reason I did not go to the wedding and to the farewell party of a close friend (she did not forbid me, but she didnt want to go with me,' said she didnt like her and I ended up feeling weird about going on a trip without her, since the wedding was in other city).

Also I had a very close friend group since high school and a few other groups of friends. She got along just fine with my friends from hs,' but seemed like never liked the others. One of those groups she didnt like because they smoked weed and seemed like 'bums'. Another group that was all couples she dint like because according to her the girls treated her poorly while we were playing a table game.

So I guess I wanna hear your thoughts and your personal experience.

So I’m think about staying with abusive gf who expects me to pay her ridiculously high monthly payment on top of living expenses.

I have posted here a lot if you check my post history. I 23f and gf 21f have been in rocky abusive relationship that started out as just the occasional mean spirited joke about my weight, my blackness, or mental health struggles. It got to the point where she now calls me a dumb bitch, throw things at me, breaks my personal belongs, and promises to sue me for filing a false restraining order.

It’s time for us to move out of our current place by end of month. I  made a list of apartments and found one in short notice. She can easily afford the place on her own but paying half would require I pick another job. I’m already stretched thin with a mountain of debt. My gf doesn’t want me to get another 9-5 but do gig jobs instead. 

I want to go home but I don’t want to leave without building a small financial fund. It hard to do when old girl expects $400 a month in back payment for lawyer cost, and fines for not doing her bidding. I know no matter if I stay and move with her to a tiny studio apartment and work two jobs or go home it will be hard.  My family wants me back but let me know there disappointed. I don’t want to be a free loader. My hometown is small so I’m scared I won’t get a job. I’ll be losing my car.",2024-10-07 22:57:40,2025-03-17 16:31:55,signs

recently, i recounted a silly story of something i did with a former neighbor who was my age, to my daughter. growing up, all my neighbors were boys but the one boy who lived two doors down was my BFF most my childhood. shortly after having told my daughter this story, and after 20+ years of being out of contact with this neighbor… he randomly pops up in my DMs. it almost felt like reminiscing of the better times manifested him back into my life, so excitedly i started talking to him. he assumed i was happily married but then i unintentionally unloaded all my life’s chaos on him and he invited me to his lake house. i agreed, and we spent the day out on the boat, catching up and then a few drinks around a fire later the evening. the way the day worked out was magical - i never thought i’d find another person i’d want to be with, but he and i connected in a way there are no words to describe. we’ve been together nonstop for a few months and i couldn’t have been happier. it’s a stark contrast from where i was to where i am.

Why do I still feel so bad about myself?,ExtraGrocery,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1fccbss/recognized_the_signs_and_got_out_why_do_i_still/,"I’ll try to keep this brief, but really want some support because I don’t understand some of these feelings. 

I (31F) moved cross country a few years ago to chase an abusive relationship. Once I got here was when things got bad, I let it go on because I had no friends or family anywhere near, and have been in a lot of therapy since. 

I have been acquaintances with W (42M) for about 6 months, and we started seeing each other about 6 weeks ago. The love bombing phase was great! Flowers, nice dates, lunches when I stayed over, caring, kind, the works. But caring got clingy and clingy got possessive pretty quickly. Unfortunately a few weeks in I was involved in an accident that resulted in a nasty concussion and found out my father has cancer. It started with getting possessive with the nurses at the hospital being too friendly, then not wanting me to spend time with a male friend, then telling me how to spend my day, and saying I needed to be around him whenever he was available and sleep with him every night to take care of me. 

I thought it was sweet (but a little troublesome) but when I recovered and got a better grasp on my family situation the hovering only got worse. Suddenly it was panic calling because I didn’t respond to a text in 9 minutes saying he was getting in the car to check hospitals for me, having opinions about my eating habits, just overall critical and controlling under the guise of me needing him to be responsible for me. I finally kindly let him know that while I appreciated the concern I was feeling parented and wanted a partner and would like a little space. He totally understood… for about an hour. Then it was dramatics (you don’t love me all my friends were right, you need to know how bad you slipped up, you’re right I’m just a monster and I’m petty and self serving, you’re too good for me, you actually can’t take care of yourself you need me) even that I had produced a body of evidence demonstrating he did need to be responsible. I told him it was all over the top and especially since I would need to be in and out of state for my parents maybe let’s cut it here. 

But a few days later I second guessed myself. That maybe I was being a little harsh since it was coming from a place of care and reached out a few days later. He apologized, we patched things up, but I wasn’t sure that was what I wanted. I even thought maybe I should have someone who cares running my life. But when it immediately went back into telling me when I would be spending time with him I told him I had plans, and the next day said I wasn’t really up to socializing and wanted to spend a quiet night in. Again, first response was understanding. The next day it was a different story. Back to texting time limits, panic texting that he was worried about me. I told him I was totally fine just gardening and he said he was coming over. I said no, I don’t want you to and hate surprise company. He said it’s not a surprise because he was telling me. I said no, he said yes, and within 45 minutes was pounding on the door, yelling to let him in, ringing the doorbell repeatedly. I kept it locked. Eventually he left and started doing the same text whirlwind, this time including that he would never show up if I didn’t want him to even though that had happened like an hour before. 

For me this was the final straw because I realized I couldn’t say “no”. Told him this was absolutely inappropriate and that I wasn’t going to play a game debating against him that he’s a bad person. He texted me back that he didn’t care and we left it at that. 

The thing is, I still feel bad. Bad that I didn’t notice the love bombing. And second guessed myself. And still feel like maybe I’m NOT able to take care of myself and acted cruelly to someone who was looking out for me. That from his perspective I was just this troubled thing that ditched him. I don’t think any of that is true. But I also don’t trust myself and if I over corrected. ",2024-09-09 00:11:50,2025-03-17 16:32:06,signs

I’m not sure if this will be confusing or seeing, so just bear with. I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 5 years now. Over the past couple years, we’ve been fighting about financial problems (I pretty much support both of us), physical affection (he wants me to be more touchy feely), lying (he constantly lies and only tells the truth when caught in multiple lies), communication (it’s now to the point where I feel like I can’t communicate to him, bc no matter what I say, he will think I’m making excuses or telling him my intentions instead of accepting responsibility for fucking up), how much I care about him, trust, and job/career stuff. In the last 2-3ish years, he’s cheated on me twice. Each time he’s said that if i were showing him more affection and giving him the attention he wanted that neither would’ve happened. The first time he was just ‘talking’ to the girl but the second time he had a whole relationship with her. He literally fucking her and buying this girl and her kid shit while I was over there paying all our bills and he was saying that he was sorry that he didn’t have any money to contribute to bills. He used my car to go see her and would tell me he was hanging out with friends (he doesn’t have his own car). Each time, he said it was my fault bc I was not providing something the relationship for him. Please keep in mind I provide financially (working 3 jobs to help keep us afloat), drive him to where he needs to be when I can, keep the house clean and clean and fold his laundry. I know I’m not perfect, all of those don’t happen all the time, but I try to make it happen as much as possible. In these situation, I feel like I’m already giving so much to the relationship that if I give him the attention he is craving that I’m not going to have anything left in the tank for me! (I’ve really been working on the whole affection thing, it’s now to the point he Denys the affection more that seeks it 
That being said we fight quite a lot but there’s only been a handful of times that he’s gotten in my face, and pushed me. In those situations, I’ve always ended up hurt in some way. He usually ends up apologizing bc he feels guilty, but saying something along the lines of, well if you wouldn’t have made me so angry, it wouldn’t have happened. About a week ago it happened again, he thought I was being disrespectful during an argument, so he got all up in my face, yelling at me (I could literally feel spit hitting my face). I told him, calmly, multiple times to get out of my face and then he shoved me super hard ‘bc he was getting out of my face’. I ended up with some gnarly bruises on my arms and legs from my fall. In previous situations, I’ve had my head and other body parts end up putting holes in the wall. That being said, these situations have probably happened less than 5 times over the relationship. There have been quite a few times in heated arguments he has called me a bitch or other names I’m a aware I can have a temper 
Here’s the thing, even if I’m not trying I will provoke him somehow. The other day, i picked him up from work and he was upset at me that I  didn’t get him dinner. The next day i got him dinner when I picked him up and he got upset at me for ‘not knowing him’. But it was a sandwich he had gotten recently. He got upset bc ‘that’s not something he eats’ but in  reality, he had literally the same sandwich last week, just with more veggies, and I just only put one veggie on. I’m now at the point where I feel like I can’t do anything right and l feel dumb a lot! I’m confused constantly. This man could talk me in circles!! I just don’t know anymore! Thought??

If I would have read between the lines back then, I would have seen how he was abusing them too. Here are some things he said about them that didn’t add up. 
1. He said that both of them vindictively cheated on him and how he had scarring trust issues because of it. But it turns out, he never actually had evidence that either of them had cheated. Sure enough in my relationship with him, he irrationally accused me of cheating at every turn. 
2. He told me he dumped GF#1 because she “gave up on the relationship”. I think she got so broken down by the abuse that she stopped being herself because of it. The same thing happened to me and I was also accused of giving up on the relationship. 
3. He blamed getting a DUI on GF#2 and said it was her fault he was drunk driving. Apparently she did not answer her phone when he called, so he said she was talking to other guys. (He offered no other explanation besides that.) So he was speeding off to her apartment to go tell her off when he was pulled over. She wasn’t talking to other guys! Whenever I didn’t answer my phone immediately he said I was talking to other guys too. 
4. He acted like fights with me were not normal arguments since I didn’t scream in his face, throw punches, and call the police. He seemed so proud of his ability to bring out reactive abuse in his victims and then call them psycho. 

And the list goes on. I wish I had noticed the problems sooner.",2023-02-17 19:34:04,2025-03-17 16:32:10,signs
1czmvv1,I think I was in an abusive relationship…how did I miss the signs?,Designer-Diet-3450,7,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1czmvv1/i_think_i_was_in_an_abusive_relationshiphow_did_i/,"Hello everyone,

I’ve been out of this relationship for a few years and am just starting to put the pieces together that it may have been abusive (probably because I recently moved far away from where he was). I’m looking for support and affirmation if it is the case. Not sure why it’s taken so long, it was an ongoing unhealthy friendship/relationship for most of my 20s but we seriously dated for almost 4 years. I’m realizing the shell of a person I became and my confidence feels so low.

Here’s some of the things that happened while dating:

-He made me clean my apartment regularly because it wasn’t good enough for him. He would watch me and call his friends and laugh about it.

-Told me he wanted me to have a bigger butt, “it would be nice.” 

-He wanted me to speak in a certain tone and would make a gesture with his hands almost touching my face if I didn't.

-Tried to work with me on my smile so it seemed more genuine (up until we dated I was complimented from friends & even strangers a lot on what a nice smile I had). 

-Make fun of me in the presence of others. Even after I told him it hurt me.

-Vent to his friends about me when he had an issue with me. But he would refuse to speak to me about these issues when I asked, but he always told me when he “told Steve about what happened with you”. I became the black sheep in that friend group and could not understand why.

-Seemed jealous about my relationship with my best friend- when he met her and her partner he made passive aggressive comments the whole weekend.

-He would say things like, “You don’t want to see me upset” if I did something that irked him

-Sexually, he would shut down if we crossed a line that involved touching me but had no issue with me touching him. Not sure if this is religious-based because we were Christians at the time.

-Made comments about my clothing being inappropriate, wanting me to cover up more.

-Said things like “way to go superstar” when I made a mistake

-Told me I’m a walking target and people will take advantage of me, so I need him around.

-Told me his family is better than mine...multiple times.

-Said he wanted to help me with finances and would look at mine here and there.

-He held me down while driving because I was looking to see if cars were coming while waiting for a turn (yes I can be a backseat driver) and blocked his view. He whipped me back in the seat and held me there for a minute, even after he made the turn. When I told him I didn’t like that, he said he did not understand what the big deal was...I blocked his view. 

-I broke up with him. After that, he reached out multiple times for a year with the sweetest messages. He also spoke to my friends while at church about what happened on his side of the break up (I just learned this from said friend).


How did you process your situation? How do you heal? I feel as though I have nobody that would believe me other than my therapist. We have a lot of mutual friends who do not see him in the same light as I do. ",2024-05-24 15:03:52,2025-03-17 16:33:10,signs

I was picking up something from the grocery store for dinner, but they didn't have the ingredient we usually use, so I called to find out if a substitute ingredient would be ok, or should I do something entirely different for dinner.
I was frustrated that, like usual, my calls went unanswered, so I finally made a decision to use the substitute ingredient.
I struggled to hold back tears the whole way home as I was worried what the reaction would be.....did I make the wrong choice?

When I got home, I was rudely told that he didn't care what I chose for dinner and he is annoyed that I keep ringing him to ask, but he also wasn't happy about the substitute ingredient and it would have been better to pick something else to cook.

Well now that I am out I can plainly see it, and I hope anyone in doubt can see it too. 
1. Walking on eggshells- my partner always said that he relished in my honesty and the way I could always speak my mind, but deep down I felt that wasn’t really true. After a few episodes of explosive anger that seemed unjustified and made no sense, I started to be very cautious about everything I said and did out of fear of getting that reaction again. I started to feel very uneasy because I recognized that he never had a legit reason to get so aggressive or cold towards me- it just happened, and his only explanation (when I got one) was that it was something I had done. 
2. Brutal criticism- I noticed that before anything had even gone wrong my partner was extremely critical towards me and pointed out that our relationship could be better if I did x, y, and z. I was very surprised because I had been so accommodating at that point and let him run the relationship to keep him happy. But even then he said I was not listening to him, making multiple mistakes, and kept pointing out faults in me that I didn’t even agree with. He acted like he was a great and patient guy to be able to overlook my blatant shortcomings. 
3. Hot and cold- he went from wanting to marry me for being the perfect woman to wanting to break up with me because my selfishness and toxic tendencies could not be forgiven. In the course of a day he would totally change his mind. And he switched his mood always after I refused to or couldn’t meet one of his demands. He was quick to say “Well I guess I was wrong about you after all…” 
4. Even from the start he expected to be my only priority. I felt nervous anytime I had to address another priority of mine because I knew he would get angry and label me as selfish and accuse me of losing interest in him.
5. Snap judgements- he never wanted to hear my explanations about anything and would assign a reason for my actions. It was always something like “You didn’t do this because you don’t care about me.” Or “You responded in this manner because you wanted to get a rise out of me.” He always made snap judgements about me that were brutally negative, and then I would always be trapped trying to explain it wasn’t like that.

Never before in history have people had something to go to in complete privacy and anonymous.

BUT

it's not accurate. It shows quotes that no one outside of a soap opera would say. Sometimes abusers might just straight up come out with abuse, but that's only usually during arguments because they know you'll excuse them because ""I'm so sorry, I was really angry and I didnt mean it. You're not _____, you're beautiful/ smart"".

It's the daily life sniper abuse these resources miss because abusers do that clever.

For example (and I'll only speak on my relationship because I won't speak over others): 

A website will say ""you look fat in that"", but my ex would pick a day where I'm happy and he would look at me while I was in the shower (he had a thing about ""keeping me company"") or getting dressed. He would say ""you know I was thinking, we are both putting weight on because we've been eating so good lately. Maybe we should both go on a diet"". He would then proceed to do absolutely nothing while focusing on my ""progress"" and making sure I go to the gym every single day. He said nice things about my body but ONLY when I was doing one meal and a day and 2+ hours at the gym. I looked like a bikini model but felt like 💩 (no, its not the case for every fit person, this is my experience).

A website will say ""who are you with? What are you doing? No you can't go out"". But my ex would say ""who are you with? I get separation anxiety and I worry about you. Let me know if any random lads turn up, you've been through things before and I want you to be protected this time."" I'd even have to phone him when I was at my mom's because of his ""separation anxiety"", so I stopped nothing going out in the end. At the time I felt bad for him.

A website will say ""you're lying. That didn't happen"". My ex would say ""no I think you're confused. That's what happened that other time, but this time this happened. I think you're getting the two mixed up. Your mom's always telling you you're ditsy and I think she's right. It's ok though, it happens. Let's forget about it now"". When I knew full 100% fact I was right. If I'd then go further, he would BLOW UP and make me believe I started it because he was being ""nice"".

I could go on for days with examples. In arguments he would just flat out call me names, a liar and accuse me of things. But like I said, they know they can make you feel bad for them after and forgive them. But in daily life they can sneak in abuse and you will have 0 clue that it's abuse because they do it so nicely.

What are you going to do? Leave because he told you you should both go on a diet together? That's absurd! But it's not, he is actually manipulating you.

I'm only descovering this now I'm 5 months free. I left because he said ""stop crying. I never laid a finger on you and you should be grateful!"" After he screamed at me in public for not backing him up in mouthing off at the checkout girl. Why I should have left is because a few months into our relationship he said ""you're too much like your dad and I feel like I'm fcking him sometimes. You're too close with your family. You're 16 now, you need to be free"". I thought he was empowering me, but he was actually cutting me away from everyone.

   I found myself in a horribly abusive relationship. I don’t know how I got there, and I never thought I’d be dumb enough to stay with someone like that. 

  I guess I just wanted to tell everyone to follow their gut. (Leave early and don’t feel guilt) & that there’s online resources to help. No one sets out to date a monster and little things can become big things. Wanting to move in early, yelling due to stress, etc.

 “Love bombing” is what you know in your mind to be “too good to be true.” If the person you’re seeing breaks this facade trust your instincts. 

A brief hopefully helpful summary of things that helped me to leave.

Facts: 

 Statistically if someone puts their hands on your throat they are more likely to kill you. Read that again. It’s your life at risk. I didn’t think the person I was seeing would escalate like they did.

 Constantly putting you down and telling you there are things wrong with you is manipulation to make you feel insecure and powerless. 

  Smashing things,slamming things, throwing things, clenching fists, and yelling will escalate into much more. They are trying to intimidate you.

 Stalking has a 40% increase in the person becoming violent. If you live with someone them having to know your whereabouts constantly is a huge problem. As is controlling everything you do. What you wear, your appearance, etc.

  You can go on record with police without pressing charges if you are in fear for your life.  Your abuser won’t know. But in my experience I should have told the cops everything early on. If you find yourself needing to talk to cops to feel safe, re-assess. Your gut instinct is screaming at you. 

  Minimize, deny, blame. That is the most classic example of how someone will get away with increasingly awful behavior. No one starts out at an extreme. They will do little things to see what they can get away with. Those insults they’re hurling and control of little things will escalate. 

 If you know someone in an abusive relationship know that they are not themselves. There is a systemic approach to eroding the self esteem of this person. 

  Help them see a counselor. Show them an abuse wheel. & I don’t know if it’s professionally recommended but Reddit/abusiverelationships helped me to see trends in behavior. Thank you guys. 

 Also have compassion. Know that no one willingly would go into that situation. They were most likely looking for love and acceptance and abusers knows that.",2020-08-10 16:37:49,2025-03-17 16:33:31,signs

For me, he went through my phone when I was sleeping in the first few weeks, and accused me of cheating, I thought we talked about it and everything was fine.  Then he went on a work trip, called me  and texted me a bunch about it, even talking about how he's my boyfriend, then looked up escorts and strip clubs an hour later & gave me an STD when he got back.  

He wanted to move in together early too.  A few weeks after meeting/seeing each other.  He was pushing for us to get an apartment together.

We still live together since we own a house together. We put the house up for sale a few months ago and my ex took down the “for sale” sign. He told me that he saw our realtor come by and take away the sign. I called the realtor and recorded the phone call and he said he did not take down the sign. After confronting my ex, he said that I took down the “for sale” sign. I paid for most of the house and want my money back so I would never take it down. I want the house to sell. This means my ex took down the “for sale” sign. 

My car registration expired so I checked my glovebox and saw that it was empty. The registration, insurance and title to the car is missing. I didn’t take any documents out of my car. My passport is also missing.

I can’t prove my ex stole my belongings from me because my parents said I could have misplaced them. There’s no direct evidence pointing to my ex but circumstantial evidence definitely points to him.

I feel like I’m going insane because I know I didn’t take anything out of my glovebox or move my passport. The house is still on Zillow but it’s annoying that he took down the sign. It doesn’t help that my parents make excuses for my ex and ALWAYS blame me for everything. I’ve tried so hard to get my parents in my corner and told them everything my narc ex has ever done to me and they either aren’t listening or don’t care.

Should I stay quiet and apply for a new registration, passport, and ask the realtor to replace the “for sale” sign? I would like to call police but don’t want to be gaslit by them or perceived as the crazy ex. Thoughts?",2023-10-13 14:05:55,2025-03-17 16:33:41,signs

t8dqs2,Giant sign— time to go,Hotflashdogmom,75,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/t8dqs2/giant_sign_time_to_go/,"I’ve been preparing to tell my husband I’m leaving — even as he has been generally acting much better, my heart isn’t in this anymore.

Well today we were in a parking lot and an old couple was in a car behind us. My husband saw the woman mouth “asshole” at him, I think because of a political bumper sticker he has on his truck. He said, “I’m not letting her get away with that.” I asked him to please just let it go. Instead he pulled out of the space and followed them to where they were parking. Keep in mind these people were old, mid 70s at least. My husband drives a giant, intimidating looking truck. He pulled up beside them as they were slowly walking in to the store, rolled down his window and said to the woman, “do you have something to say to me?” Her husband, who was hunched over and walking with a cane, was totally confused and couldn’t have been sweeter as his wife just ignored the situation and walked into the store. He said, “you must have us mixed up with someone else.” My husband said, “I’m not confused. She called me an asshole.” Can you imagine how scared they were? At this point I am fuming, and my husband suddenly snaps back to reality and drives off instead of getting into a further verbal altercation with elderly people.

Then he knew he’d screwed up and acted sad and remorseful. He knew how upset I was with him. He kept saying in a pitiful voice “I’m trying to do better! I really am. I’m having a bad day.”

What is WRONG with him? I was waiting for yet another sign that it’s time to go— that was it.

She got married 2 years back, she had a thriving career in our country and her then boyfriend was living in another country for work and had a not so great career, has debt and mostly nothing promising for future either.

I am not sure how however my friend decided to quit her career here and start from scratch there where he was living, she couldn't use her 5yrs of experience there as the field doesn't hire immigrants for the roles. It took her 4 months and loads of stress and struggle to find a basic bare minimum paying job there. She had her savings from previous job and those got exhausted in this drill, she also took her husband on a vacation from her saving. Now she is doing a second job as well, all of this just because she feels that he should not be deprived of happiness that he finds in his choice of being there however she is okay letting go of her career that she loved. Trust me she is so capable that if they move back here, her salary can keep a family of 4 adults running fine. 

Before getting married she was kept hanging by this guy, on bare minimum and ignored always, if it was not for her, he would have never ever taken any step towards her, he took her for granted always and I have seen her anxious and crying most of the time when she was allmost dating him as he was giving her a cold shoulder yet not letting her go entirely. She was highly depressed during those years, crying most of the time and being obsessed about him. 

After repeated attempt he finally said yes to marrying her and told her that even he loves her just that he is not that expressive (that's how she tells us) she justifies all of his disrespect (in front of in-laws as well), mockery, subtle taunts and more as his inability to communicate, which she further justifies as a result of him not having much friends growing up.

When I asked her recently as to why she loves him, she took a while to think, first she said she doesn't know why she feels so strongly for him and then said because he is straight forward. She didn't had anything to say about how he adds into her life or makes it better. I found that alarming. Again i know people marry for different reasons but she is someone who is full of empathy and kindness and she expects emotional intimacy which he rarely brings and she agrees on that. 

That's one part, second part being, she talks repeatedly and highly of her mom, justifying how mother's biased treatment of her brother and her is bec of conditioning and her mom is too good at heart otherwise. She repeatedly tells about how her mom is an amazing person and a victim because her father doesn't help her mom in the house, she feels deeply for her mother and always wants to save her and stand up for her against the patriarchal system of the family, despite this her mother continues treating her son and daughter differently and highly believes in serving men of the family.

 I have been at her home and finding her mother mocking and taunting her over small things. So not my place but I have a feeling that her mother likes to be the victim and get attention and sympathy from her. 

I understand that this is not my palce to analyse this or find connections between these 2 people that she always talks so highly of repeatedly, even when she is high,  however this does feels like she is more of trying to convince herself that these are good people rather than expressing it to us. What eats me is the existence of 2 possibilities, either she has a great mother and partner or these 2 people that she looks up to so much are feeding off her. 

I fear for her safety and future but i know i cannot do anything about it unless it's actually happening and she calls it out. I am venting here because I am looking to understand if I am over analysing or can this be dangerous for her.",2023-10-31 10:42:38,2025-03-17 16:33:47,signs

k1iixy,Signs you should leave your relationship,stopquaking,55,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/k1iixy/signs_you_should_leave_your_relationship/,"These are some signs I wish I would have listened to when I was younger. I was in a really toxic relationship with I was 18 with someone 5 years older than me but I didn't leave because my relationship didn't show signs of being an abusive relationship. My partner never hit me or even yelled at me and it wasn't an abusive relationship (I think), so I thought I had to stay. Please listen to me, if your relationship shows any of these signs then you need to LEAVE immediately. It doesn't matter that maybe it's not full blown abuse, its still toxic, and you don't deserve to be in a toxic relationship.

1) This relationship functions completely differently to all your other relationships: In a bad relationship everything feels different, this person feels different, normal 'rules' about relationships don't apply to them.  Your relationships with other people, like your friends, feel easy and uncomplicated but everything about your relationship with this person is complicated and confusing, and not in a good way. 

2) you can't be yourself at all: with your friends you notice that you can basically do what you want, say what you want, express yourself however you want (with a few very minor exceptions here and there obviously) and you know nothing bad will happen if you do. In good relationships you feel safe and loved, unconditionally. In a bad relationship its the exact opposite, you can't do anything without getting into trouble for it. The love you receive from this person is incredibly conditional and they're always leaning towards seeing you in a bad light when nobody else you know sees you like that. Every time you express yourself, go out somewhere, disagree with them etc you get made to feel incredibly guilty, like you've done something terrible. Eventually you stop being yourself in order to minimize these guilt trips.

3) You get guilt tripped all the time: Your partner is always talking about how you've hurt them by something you've done, or even accuses you of things you haven't done/puts words in your mouth. Your partner has called you selfish, narcissistic for doing things that none of your other friends would be bothered by, like going out partying, respecting a boundary, or something innocuous like that. Your partner does this so much that you always feel like you're a horrible person, or may even think that you're abusing them, even though you have good intentions and none of your other friends feel abused by you.

4) You are scared of them: You get a bolt of fear deep in your stomach every time you see them, this person terrifies you and you don't like being around them, its because you know the experience with them is going to be terrible and they're going to make you feel bad.

5) You feel like you have no choice but to be in a relationship with them: In a good relationship you should feel free to leave it if its not working out or you don't want to be in it and not feel guilty. In a bad relationship this option is taken from you, your partner might guilt trip you heavily and insinuate that they need you and you believe that they might self harm or even kill themselves if you leave them.    Nobody should emotionally blackmail someone into staying with them, we are not entitled to people's love and affection.

6) No matter what you do they're never happy, its never good enough: Sometimes even your partner might ask you to do one thing, then when you do it, get upset and ask you why you didn't do the exact opposite. No matter how much of yourself you give up to please them, even when you're a shell of the person you used to be and your entire life revolves around making them happy, they still will think of you as selfish and your efforts not good enough. 

7) They put you down/have a low opinion of you: Your partner makes jokes about you that are degrading or humiliating. In my case, my partner often complained a lot about hipsters and millennials and how pretentious they were, and  then he would refer to me as a hipster in separate conversations. When I pointed out that they were always associating me with a group of people they constantly insulted I was dismissed. Because they were older than me I was constantly dissed for my age as well, I was often called a millennial, another group they insulted, and when I pointed out to them that actually technically I'm gen z and they're a millennial, I was dismissed again.  

8) You're scared to reach out to friends/family: Because you're scared that maybe they'll think you're the abuser, but also you're scared of getting into trouble because your partner has made you feel like telling anyone about your relationship is the worst thing in the world and something only someone horrible would do. 

9) You feel miserable and hopeless: You feel like you are lacking in hope, that things will never get better, because deep down, you feel trapped. You are trapped, in a toxic relationship. When you're with this person you're never happy, or you're rarely happy. 

10) You feel like your life doesn't belong to you anymore: Because it doesn't. Your entire life has narrowed down to just this one person and doing what they want, in my case because they made me feel like I was a terrible person if I didn't. You might have even given up on living your life for yourself completely, just completely putting it into someone else's hands to do what they want with it. This is because doing this minimises the toxic behaviours/abuse slightly more than sticking up for yourself and you're tired. You think maybe if you just hand over everything and stop being yourself completely they'll finally leave you alone/approve of you. They won't. 

11) The relationship is really hypocritical: You go out of your way to say the right thing, do the right thing, are always expected to apologise, but your partner says whatever they want, does whatever they want, and doesn't really apologise. Your partner thinks you're being ridiculous/sensitive when you point out something they've been doing that upsets you, yet they are incredibly sensitive to any criticism and you have to walk on eggshells to avoid starting an argument. The worst part is your partner always tells you that you're doing the opposite, that you're tactless, selfish, that you never think before you speak.

12) You argue all the time: And you never ever win any of them. Your partner starts a new argument almost every week, or even more than that. These are over things they think you've done wrong, the arguments can get dragged out for days and always have to end up with you apologising, Even when you do apologise, especially early on, your partner will still want to grill you over and over how you hurt them and how you did something wrong, and will still sometimes drag it out over multiple days. When I would actually start to win an argument my partner would breakdown, would tell me that they were literally shaking and tell me to please stop with the arguing. I was compared to a dog with a bone, and told I was obsessed with winning after one argument where for once I decided that I wasn't going to just let them win and apologise to them for something I didn't think I'd done wrong.

There's probably more but these are the main ones that come to mind. Writing this out makes me realise my relationship was actually probably more abusive than I thought. Geez. Anyways sorry this is SUPER SUPER long, but hopefully somebody reads it and realises its their relationship, that even though their partner doesn't scream or yell or throw things and seems like a really good person, it doesn't mean they should stay with them. It doesn't matter if they're an abuser or not, you don't have to figure it out, but you have to get out because being in a relationship like this will kill you.

I got out, had a year or two lag where the events sort of spiralled through me, and now I can say that I'm doing okay. I'm happy. You can be happy too, you can get out, as long as they aren't controlling your finances or threatening your life then its easier than you think. Get out, get out, get out.

Because of that, I prided myself on having a finely attuned narcissistic traits radar. Nothing could get past me... or so I thought.  

Enter: quiet BPD. 

My partner was the complete opposite of my dad. Loving, caring, compassionate, understanding, engaged in individual therapy and a big fan of meditation and self-reflection. Took responsibility for his divorce. Was a wonderful dad to his children.  

Yes, there was a love-bombing phase in the beginning, but I thought it was just that I had finally met my soulmate. I now realize that the love-bombing was mediated by the fact that he had children, and for their sake we couldn't rush into moving in together or getting married, which we absolutely would have if they were not a factor.  

We even preemptively went to couples therapy, where the therapist loved us and had full faith in us as a couple. My friends and family adored him.  

About 2.5 years in, the red flags quietly emerged (noticeable to only me), but at that point I was so confident that I knew this person's heart like it was my own, that I started to believe the conflict in the relationship was my fault. I started to believe the things he was telling me, like that he always did more for me than I did for him, and like that I was selfish and defensive.

I believed in us so much that we decided to have a baby together. The first month that we tried, I secretly panicked and considered buying Plan B. But I didn't. The second month that we tried, I got pregnant, which is when the emotional and verbal abuse kicked into full gear. It continued to escalate until I finally decided that I was done for good, after he threw me and baby out for the second time.  

My point of this post is to encourage you all to forgive yourselves. We all have unique histories that influence how we interpret our worlds. Other people may never understand, and that's ok. If you haven't left the relationship yet, I'm happy that you've arrived at this sub. I do think it's the first step toward enlightenment and ultimately leaving the relationship.

I've left my relationship and have been thinking about various warning signs throughout that I ignored (stupidly). I just feel really confused because part of me misses her, even though I know I shouldn't...

A few being that within the first few weeks of seeing my now ex she:

•Told me that she ""always fucks things up"" in relationships, and she hoped she ""doesn't fuck things up with me, too.""

•Said to me she was ""worried she'd hurt \[me\]"" and she ""really doesn't want \[me\] to get hurt.""

•That same night, she came over to my house drunk, belittled me, called me names, tried to humiliate me, spit on my sofa, and then demanded to ""take a nap"". When I told her ""no"" and that she had to leave and that I'd walk her home, she said ""if you wake me up, I will hit you"" and then seemingly instantly, passed out. Mind you, we'd known each other for just a month at this point.

**Even though she was drunk, was her threat to hit me a sign that she would be physically abusive later on? Is being drunk an excuse for this type of behavior because she was just, well, drunk? Or is it a sign of their true self coming out?**

In fact, as time went on, she did become more physically abusive, all usually when ""drunk"". However, despite being ""drunk"", she would at first deny many things she did, but then would later acknowledge that she remembered doing those things - so were you really ""drunk"" at all? You are still in control, and making decisions, I'd assume if you then remember and acknowledge the things you did... Right?

One time, she admitted after a drunken incident that she ""wanted to see how far she could push me...to see how much I could take."" That sounds pretty intentional to me...

**I just find the whole thing really confusing. Why would someone do that to me?**

**Things she did later in our relationship when ""drunk"":**

\-Kicked her legs at me during a *tantrum*

\-Biting me at a convenience store so hard my shoulder turned purple

\-Throwing objects while I was nearby out of ""frustration"" (never thrown at me, just near me - it did frighten me, though). This happened twice.

\-Groping me when I told her no.

\---

I'm just so confused by the way she acted. It was horrible and made me so uncomfortable.

I know I had to leave, because she was also very emotionally abusive to me, too.

**I just don't know what the real her was?**

One of the last things she said to me before I broke up with her for good was she said that she **""likes toxic relationships, she likes the drama... it's exciting.""**

**Does that mean she liked doing these things to me the whole time?**",2023-03-09 22:58:17,2025-03-17 16:33:54,signs

He was incredibly sweet and charming. Invited me over and cooked me a nice dinner and we had a great time. 

So we started hanging out on the weekends. And I’d stay there on my days off. By the third week things were getting kind of odd. 

He started a new job. We woke up and he took off to work. We texted throughout the day and I told him I’d have supper ready when he got home. He tells me he’ll be back at 6. 

Messaged him around 5 to tell him I started supper and that I hope he’s had a good day. He says alright and that he’s about to leave. 

6:30 rolls around, supper has been done for about 30 mins, he’s not home. I text him to see if he’s almost here and he says he left a little later than he wanted to but he’ll be home soon. 

8 rolls around, still not home. I text him and he tells me he decided to go to the bar with his new coworkers. 

Which I thought was really odd because he didn’t say anything about it when he was about done with work. I was a little bit bothered. But I just said that I was glad to hear he’s getting along with his coworkers and to be careful on the way home. He said he’d be home soon. 

At this point I’m pretty bothered. It’s about 11pm now and he starts sending me snaps of him driving/music playing. But this is where my alarm bells really went off. 

When he gets home he’s mad at me for not being shitty towards him. He told his coworkers that I was blowing his phone up trying to get him to come home and for some reason he wanted that to be true because he wanted an excuse to leave. He said it seemed like “I didn’t give a shit.” 

He worked the next day. He was home when he said he’d be that day. But when he got home he told me he was planning on taking my car but couldn’t find my keys. I didn’t tell him anything about being able to drive my car, and I would’ve said no because I didn’t wanna be stuck at his house. So that was another red flag. 

There was another time where he said I had said something racist, I think it was a day or two after the supper incident. Usually I’m pretty conscious about that kind of thing and he wouldn’t tell me what I said because “it wasn’t worth arguing over” even though we weren’t arguing. Took my by surprise but thinking back there’s nothing that could even be taken that way that I said to him. I think he knew it would bother me if I had said something and he just wanted it to get under my skin. 

He also wanted to be official really fast but also didn’t wanna be open about our relationship. 

Anyways I stopped going over there. Didn’t give much of an explanation because I feel like he just thrived on trying to fuck with me, because that’s what abusers do. He tried to accuse me of stealing things from his house too after he was sure I wasn’t coming back. 

Just glad to be able to spot these things pretty quickly. A couple small incidents while an abuser is trying to get a feel for how far they can take it is all I need to know I need to drop him like dead weight.",2023-03-17 17:38:52,2025-03-17 16:33:58,signs
1foszys,Tonight he strangled me ,peppermintjello,221,168,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1foszys/tonight_he_strangled_me/,"I was at work. I just started a recent job WFH. I started to take pictures of myself and I felt very down. I haven’t felt very beautiful since I had my son in January. So I sent him some texts and vented about how I felt about my body. I didn’t think it would be bad to share that with him. 

But then he replied with “do you ever stop spiraling? Omfg” So I stopped. I was silent. Then he came out of the room upstairs and began huffing about how he couldn’t do this anymore. And then he finally came into the room I was in. I hadn’t said anything to him at that point besides what was on the texts. I told him he should leave the room because things were starting to get emotionally charged. He got more upset and then punched a hole in the wall. 

This isn’t the first time he’s put a hole in the wall in our home. So that really ripped me a new one and I went into the room to confront him. That was my first mistake. To let it keep escalating. But he’s broken the door, the walls, the window on my old car..

So we get into it. By this point we’ve been physically fighting each other weekly. But tonight, he grabbed me by the neck, and I felt him squeeze tighter. Like he actually wanted to do it. Then he lifted his other hand to put both of them around my throat. 

It started to feel really serious then. 

I was able to get out of his grasp and I started to cry. It feels pathetic to cry now because we’re both fighting each other. 

But we also had our baby in the room. And he woke up and started to wail. And everything just felt doomed. It has been for a while. 

I don’t think this story will end well for us. ",2024-09-25 01:32:49,2025-03-17 16:34:01,strangle
1hg24j4,My Husband Strangled Me Over a Menu Item in Front of Our 3-Year-Old — I Finally Escaped and Called the Cops,Own_Yam2847,204,71,https://i.redd.it/s5jo64fs0c7e1.jpeg,"Yesterday, we started fighting over something so insignificant: a menu item. He gaslit me, saying it didn’t exist, and the tension escalated. He came home angry, bringing me food I said I didn’t want. It seems he had a flat tire on his Kia and didn’t want to deal with it, so instead, he unleashed everything on me for “not listening” and told me to “just order something on the fucking menu.”

When he got home, it spiraled. He began packing my things, taking both keys, throwing slurs, and threatening to leave. I asked him if he was drunk, and his response was chilling: “I’ll tell you later.” He’s a demon when he drinks. I started recording the argument to vent on Reddit, and that’s when everything exploded.

He slapped the phone out of my hand, broke it, and got on top of me. In front of my 3-year-old daughter, he beat me repeatedly and strangled me, demanding I delete the videos. I started deleting whatever I could to get him to stop. I convinced him to let me go upstairs, saying I’d “delete the Reddit posts there.” As I was walking up, he put me in a chokehold so tight I could barely breathe. I faked logging into Reddit, deleting things, and trying to calm him down.

But it didn’t stop. He punched me again when I tried talking him down. Desperate, I said, “I would never call the cops; you know me,” trying to get him to let me go. That’s when he finally stopped.

I waited for an opening. The second he mentioned looking for my phone upstairs, I grabbed it, ran as fast as I could, and hid in a neighbor’s garage. I was terrified but managed to call the police. I was so shaken I called friends to help reach 911, too.

The police came, and for the first time in a long time, I felt relief. But instead of support, his mother got pissed that I called the cops. Her first words? Not, “Are you okay?” Not concern for me or her granddaughter. Instead: “Now we have to pay for a lawyer. Now we have to pay for bail.”

There’s been a long history of abuse. His parents know it—they’ve known it—but they enable him. They’ve said he’s “trying to get better.” Enough is enough.

Now, I’m staring down divorce, child support, alimony, and an uphill battle while his parents attack me for spending money on my nails and lashes. Your son strangled me in front of your grandchild, and this is what you’re upset about?

And to top it off, his mom tells me, “He secretly told us he wanted a divorce last week because you control the finances and blackmail him.” That’s laughable. I’ve begged for a divorce, but he always fake-packs, leaves for a bit, and comes back because he refuses to deal with banking or anything else.

I’m done. I didn’t think I’d be free, but I am. I know the road ahead won’t be easy, but I can’t keep enabling him anymore.",2024-12-17 03:56:15,2025-03-17 16:34:03,strangle

1hk09o0,I was strangled last night ,ghostrider_002,74,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hk09o0/i_was_strangled_last_night/,"Last night my now ex boyfriend strangled me. 

He had choked me maybe once or twice in the past, but not this bad.. 

When he puts his hands on me last night I remember first thinking that there was no way he was actually going to choke me… right? Then the pressure on my neck became greater. A chokehold turned into a headlock. 

I remember half way thinking “oh my god I might actually die. How do I even get out of this?” I remember frantically looking for a way to get him off me while simultaneously trying not to exert too much energy so I didn’t completely lose oxygen.. 

And the worst part is, he says he “doesn’t remember” … how convenient right? I called the cops after and now he’s mad at me for “ruining his life” … what a joke. As if I somehow forced him to choke me out. 

 It’s hard because i unfortunately care about this person even though he’s dangerous. Unfortunately it hurts my heart to hear him cry even though his actions dug his own grave. 

No matter how much I love him though I am never going back. I refuse to die at the hands of this man. Or any man for that matter. 

The only regret I have is not leaving sooner. I don’t know who needs to hear this but it doesn’t get better. It will never get better. You cannot love these men into being better. These men are not wired the same as you and me, or people with any empathy. 

I remember during some of our worst fights I would literally wish for him to hit me, because then I’d have indisputable “proof” that couldn’t be twisted by any form of gaslighting… don’t be like me. Please. I could’ve taken my last breath last night. And you’re probably thinking “he’d never do that to me” … yeah, I thought that too. 

The truth of the matter is if he’s hitting or breaking things around you, YOU ARE NEXT. It is NOT if, it is when. ",2024-12-22 15:07:58,2025-03-17 16:34:05,strangle

I'm also having cardiac problems that I can't seem to pinpoint the cause of, which may be unrelated. Can strangulation even cause heart problems? I don't even know.

He didn't even strangle me for that long. I never lost consciousness. But I think if not on a physical level, emotionally something in me changed that day. I was terrified of him, of what he would do. He put his hands on me and I knew then if I stayed with him it would be the end of me.

I feel like a failure since then. Like I can't learn things the same, or do work the same, like I'm weaker and worse off permanently. I think something in me died that day and sometimes I really mourn who I was before meeting him, long before he ever put his hands on me.

What I do remember is standing across the room from him and suddenly he lunged, caught my neck in his hands and threw me to the floor. I felt his hands tighten 3 different times around my neck. I couldn’t breathe. I had not hit him, thrown anything at him, done anything physical prior to this. We were just arguing. My small dog was in the area he threw me down and got really scared. My cats eyes were wide in fear. I feel so bad they had to witness that. I don’t know if they understand but I think they could tell I was hurt and scared. When he got up he went out of the apartment. I had bruises on my neck the following day and severe headache. I called a domestic violence hotline because I didn’t have anyone else to talk to but I didn’t go to the police because although I work I can’t afford rent on my own if he gets locked up.

13hzcbz,My fiancé strangled me. I know I need to leave.,Wanderment1334,97,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/13hzcbz/my_fiancé_strangled_me_i_know_i_need_to_leave/,"I'm posting this on a throwaway account- I don't want to be defined by this. I am embarrassed, upset, scared, and I guess I'm just looking for some support that I am doing the right thing. It has been about a month since this happened. I want to clarify that I am not perfect or innocent in any way. I have said mean things during arguments and I know I am wrong for that. We are engaged and have been together for over four years. We have two children, both toddlers. I'm 27 years old and so is he. For what it's worth, I am 5'0 and 110lbs and he is almost 6'0 and 210lbs-- I just wanted to put that in here incase anyone is curious if I have defended myself. I have tried. But he is much bigger than me and I wouldn't be able to defend myself against him if I really needed to.

We were arguing over something miniscule- I can't remember what, I'm sorry. I said that I needed to leave so that we could calm down. I didn't want things to escalate even further. I brushed his shoulder while I was walking out and I know it was wrong. I can't remember if I did it on purpose or not. As soon as I got to the door to walk out, my body was lifted off the ground. I couldn't fight back or scream because I couldn't breathe or move. I think I froze in fear in the beginning of it but I do vaguely remember putting my hands over his while they were on my throat. It only took maybe 10 seconds before everything started going black. It happened very fast and I couldn't have fought him off if I tried. Right when I was about to pass out, he dropped me. I was so dizzy and out of it that my head hit the ceramic tile leaving a huge bruise and bump. I don't really remember what was said but I ran to the bathroom and rested on the floor. I can't remember going to sleep that night or anything so I don't remember him apologizing or anything.

Nothing has happened since then. No fighting, arguments, physical abuse, or anything. He's apologized for it a million times but I know the statistics. I know what happens to women like me when we don't get out. I know what I need to do. He's sorry for strangling me and he'll be sorry for killing me. I don't work because I'm a stay at home mom. I know my parents would let me and the kids stay with them but I'm just so embarrassed. The younger version of me would've never allowed this to happen and I don't know how I got here. He's busted my lip in the past- maybe 6 or so months ago. He's ripped the shower curtain down when I was showering and while he flung it around, it hit me in the face. He claims that never happened but it did. He tells me if I wouldn't make him so angry that this shit wouldn't happen. I feel like a fucking idiot writing all of this out because the red flags are everywhere. I am too involved in true crime to play coy to how this ends. And here I am wanting to say that he is a good guy and a very loving partner- but how can I say that while writing this post? I'm an idiot.

I can't just call the police. He IS the police. We live in a small county and he knows every other officer. He knows every good attorney and the judges. He knows everyone in our county and I know that no one will believe me. We live in a good ole boys town. He's from a very popular and loved family from where we live and I know how much I will be absolutely destroyed if I speak out against him. If I called the police on him, they wouldn't believe me. There are maybe two officers I know that would support me but they aren't in this jurisdiction. Part of me wants to believe him when he says he won't ever do it again but like I said, I know the statistics. I KNOW what happens to future me. I feel like a fool.

I don't really know why I'm posting this. I just needed to say it. I guess I just don't know what my first step would be with my circumstances. I know I'm an idiot for not leaving sooner so please don't think less of me for it. I just want the best for my children. And I know my children can't be raised in this kind of environment. They deserve better and I hate myself for waiting this long already. I just don't know where to go from here.

Thank you to everyone who read this far. I'm sorry it's a jumbled mess. If I missed anything, I'm sorry. I'll answer any questions if needed. Thank you in advance for any replies.",2023-05-15 05:59:43,2025-03-17 16:34:14,strangle

I was nonconsensually strangled by someone in the past on a date (not to the point where I passed out, but close to that and it was pretty terrifying) so it makes me uneasy, but if I say anything he'll always just roll his eyes and say I'm overreacting and/or he's just joking and not actually using any pressure.

I also have a chronic pain condition, so even light slapping/hitting can be painful sometimes. I often tell him ""ow"" and to be more gentle with me, and he sighs and says that I'm too sensitive, everything hurts me, and that I'm no fun. He always thinks I am overreacting or being dramatic when I say anything so I just let it go, even if it does hurt a little sometimes.

He has never *actually* hurt me or laid a finger on me in a physically violent way or when he's angry. He has rage/anger issues and will sometimes lose it and cuss me out, raise his voice, yell/shout, throw or kick things, punch the wall/table, or threaten to break up with me. Then he apologizes profusely afterward. He wants to get help to stop being unstable and lashing out at me. He also says that at least he's not physically abusive (and that a lot of men are a lot worse).

Since he's never actually harmed or physically abused me, I'm not sure if I should be concerned about any of the stuff he does jokingly, or if I am overreacting.",2024-12-13 00:48:45,2025-03-17 16:34:15,strangle

anyway this was over a full year now, last time he strangled me was november or december 2023

if you've been strangled, do you get ptsd symptoms from it/have you been diagnosed with ptsd? I am not looking for a diagnosis, I'm already diagnosed with cptsd but can anyone empathize with these symptoms:
- I just smoked, I don't smoke often so I notice the way it constricts my airway in a way I didn't pay as much attention to before. feeling any pressure on my windpipe freaks me out.
- I have nightmares of being strangled. doesn't help that I gave sleep apnea so whenever I have an episode now it'll be accompanied by a strangulation dreams. like i physically can't breathe and it translates in the dream as seeing him above me strangling me. fortunately new daily inhaler has helped me breathe better in my sleep so this hasn't happened lately
- I guess sort of flashbacks? like I'll be driving and still aware of the road but reliving it in my minds eye
- I can't watch it in movies. even cartoons if a character gets choked out I start to feel it
- tried to hook up with someone and they put their hand near my neck and I immediately hit it away from me

anyway i'm doing pretty much fine now, overall happy with life. just small moments aren't good. ",2025-01-25 03:16:41,2025-03-17 16:34:16,strangle

We’ve met at a time when he was married, but soon after grown feelings and formed a relationship. He has stated he never wanted to be married and wanted to leave. During this course of 5 years, I’ve been through a situation when many days felt like too good to be true. Felt like I was being watched by people. I also felt like every time I was having a good day, he would suddenly use that against me and send me sms’s trying to diminish me that I done something for myself. He would then ghost me or try to guilt trip me. It then became a continuous cycle of this for 5 years. 

During our early sex, he also went out of my room and grabbed a knife out of the kitchen. He came back and I felt absolutely mortified but calm. He went on me and put it on me. He wanted to stab me but didn’t and his persona changed as if his mind got taken over by another part of him stating that he would’ve put a knife through me that night. 

It went by to another incident where he’s continuously keeping an eye on me. And I’m having struggles trying to get out of his mind or world. He had emotionally tried to kill me and physically killed me recently this year.

I found out during the course of our 7 years (now) he has also divorced, he had also continued another affair during the last 5 years and I’m in this position of feeling stunned. 

During this course of spending 5 years almost everyday with this man, and supporting him in his growth despite his violent tendencies I wished I woke up sooner. I now face a crazy woman that he also slept with during that same course knowing personal things about our relationship which is creepy and also obscene. I phoned his ex wife and asked him if he was ever violent towards her and she also didn’t answer. I confronted him and asked why he cheated when it was a serious relationship and he ended up strangling me in his bed till I passed out and screaming stop stop stop.

I asked why did you do that. He laughed and said I thought you might’ve wanted that. 

I left his home speechless and concerned. I face my days being emotionally played by his feelings and need to find ground. 

He smsed me saying I’m a sociopath and I’m selfish. I had enough of his psychopath violent an also him continuously blaming me. 

The woman he also ended up cheating on the same time we are together for 5 years has also been harassing me on the phone. She also has been harassing him and sending him blackmail and threats of going to his home which is separate from his family. I am dealing with 2 psychopaths and I am questioning on how on earth did two potentially killers are not being watched by state police for the amount of homicide and also organized crimes are involved. The woman is also known to have bashed and hurt many men as well. 

I can’t go to the cops because his ex wife is part of a bikie gang. I am certain they had eliminated people in the past. I never knew this at the time and had received threats. I don’t know what to do. 

I want these two psychological abusers out of my life for good. I don’t know who is trained enough to eliminate such attacks to a point I had died this year 4-5 times due to his mental attacks and me convulsing due to being strangled this year.

Then I ended up seeing a whole BAG of letters (i was red flagging debt or whatever) , but then another bag and i saw the apple iPhone logo
and i looked and there was a dead iPhone and a dead andriod. WHY would you hold onto them in the first place, if they’re all locked up and can’t get in them, he said he didn’t even know about them or forgot them. He was stood over me, crossing his arms, then flailing them around , and shouting.

there was a bank card to  , a monzo and i found the girl on fb and she was 19 and she said she lost it in the town me and my bf live in and my bf said he only recently found it in his coat and he didn’t even know her 

he’s been sat in the other room still no cuddles properly he’s just sulking and at this point im just sad as fucking hell he blames me for everything he doesn’t think about me at all when i get worked up, but I learned about him

I did not go to the police. I told him if he let me go home to my mother & father that I wouldn't call.

I do have a video and text message proof that this happened.

I know I should definitely report this, but carrying the weight of being the reason why someone goes to prison is unnerving to me. On the other hand, I feel like I'll be angry down the line in time because I didn't do anything about it and let him get away with doing such a thing to me. 

Part of me feels like I'm over reacting because he only strangled me for less than 10 seconds. Is it worth it to ruin someone's life for less than 10 seconds?

sorry for weird formatting issues i'm on mobile

to sum up our relationship, i (19ftm, closeted) started dating my boyfriend (18m) in 2020, i was in a very bad home situation so i moved in with him and his mother around june of 2020 when we were both 15, she's been very welcoming and has no idea what's going on (or what little she does know, has excused)

the physical and mental abuse started in early 2021, and just keeps getting worse. 

for reference i have autism and boyfriend often takes advantage of it by forcing me into a meltdown where i cant control my actions and hit him so he has an excuse to beat the fuck out of me. but he never leaves marks, he knows better.

2 weeks ago, october 20th, after inducing a meltdown on me he used his hand to cover up my nose and mouth, almost entirely cutting off my breathing. then he threw me on the floor, sat on my chest and did it again. he did it several more times giving me about 15 seconds in between (for him to catch his breath)
during this i whimpered to him that he was going to kill me, so he screamed GOODBYE in my face when he went to smother me again.

then he got off of me and said he was going to find duct tape to tie up my hands so i couldn't fight back.
and in that moment i was positive i was going to die, that was it for me.

then his mom came home from work. 30 minutes earlier than she is supposed to. and it was over and i'm alive. she doesn't know what he did and she never will.

i was a victim to a home invasion when i was 13 years old and home alone. the fear i felt then is NOTHING like what i felt 2 weeks ago.

and there's nothing i can do about it. i can't leave. i've more or less accepted that i'm going to die by his hand because now i really know what he's capable of. i have no friends here because i've been so isolated (i'm not allowed to leave the house by myself, only to stores with him&his mom or short walks around the neighborhood). and after everything i've been through with the legal system in my state from the home invasion, i'd rather die than get police involved AGAIN.

sorry this is so random i just wanted to get it all out, thanks whoever is reading for just giving me the time of day to hear my story.",2023-11-08 06:11:30,2025-03-17 16:35:32,strangle

Valentine’s Day would have been five years and that is special even through ALL of what I’ve gone through. Last night I was mulling over how even though he stopped putting his hands on me and breaking things, he was still driven somehow to get the rage out. We’d had a really nice weekend and (long story short) he snapped once we got to his apartment. Instead of taking it out on me (although it obviously indirectly still haunts me) he grabbed an innocent kitten, screaming and cussing at it. It peed all over him and then he hit it over and over and threw it because he got even more angry it peed on his sweatshirt. To this day I am haunted by that scene, I feel sick, and I feel terrible that I did nothing. I was afraid and I left but I did nothing. I struggle with this so much. He’s off probation for domestic violence arrests and I should have called in him many times but I didn’t. Fox, I have sick guilt over this.

it's been 2 days. It still hurts to swallow.
My heartbis broken...How could the Man I loved do this?
I didnt return his attempts of kindness back the way he wantes me to.
I wasnt a bitch it's just that it became hard to see his kindness as something sincere...If i didnt come at him with the feelings of gratitude he wanted he began name calling.
I didn't fight back with mean words. I tried to tell him why I felt the way I did. 
Then he started throwing things at me. while i sat in our bed trying to write my words down because he just wouldn't listen to my feelings and concerns. 
I tried to leave. That's when he 1st hit me.  
I had told him from the beginning of our relationship if he ever laid a hand on me I would be gone forever....so I reminded him of that and said I would now be leaving forever and this was not just going to be time apart for him to calm down. I tried to leave...he blocked the way so I pushed to try to get through the door way. He took that as it was now ok to beat my ass.
For an hour he would beat me then stop and try to convince me that He wasn't being this way to be cruel. I had turned him intinthis monster.
He wrapped his hands around my throat and pinned my body against the ground...this time it was only for a moment....he continued to punch and kick me while i cried...i screamed as he grabbed my hair and slammed me against the floor.
I tried to call me friend but he made me hang up.
I begged for him to let me go...all this was happening while my daughter was sleeping in the room next door..
He held me down a second time....I tried to fight back...his hands got tighter...I couldn't scream...I couldn't breathe....i could only stare into his hateful eyes and pray he would let me go so I could save me daughter....that's all in wanted was to get the fuck out of that house with her.....my ears started to ring....my vision began to fade.....he let go but I don't remember..i just remember springing back up in defense....and telling myself to tell him what ever he needed to hear so i could get a moment to leave and call the police.
I finally got out and called the police....I reaked of beer from where he had spit it on me and spilled it over me as I was crying....I told them what had happened and that they could get me to take a test...the dispatcher haf told me to get in my car anf wait for them....they Took pictures of my neck and head...pictures of the bruises.....I showed them the voice recordings of how he was talking to me right before it happened....they arrested him...
His friends called me asking if i could drop the charges. Asking if I thought it was right to ruin his life over this.....they didnt understand...I was mad and sad and shocked and confused.....I couldnt even drop the charges if i wanted to.....the cops are the ones that prosecuted him...I could not show up to court.....but the judge would still look at the evidence....

I married my husband after 4 years of being together. He’s a good man, he would treat me like a princess 98% of the time and that 2% he would be angry during an argument and break things, sometimes even hitting me or handling me roughly. I grew up in a house like that (my mom) so I thought it was normal. A year into our marriage he hit me for the first time, he later found God and he changed, he was so patient and kind, even when he was upset. A year later we had a baby, and during this time our arguments escalated, and he’d break more things, pull my hair, and demand respect from me. I changed as a woman when I married him,  I became the perfect housewife, I made our house a home, kept it so tidy, learned to cook from scratch, and so much more. 2 weeks ago he got angry and went to hurt himself, while trying to stop him he strangled me and told me he was going to kill me. And I think I’m still in shock. He was arrested. And I feel this mixture of guilt, betrayal, anger, and heartache. I don’t understand this pain, and I don’t want to feel it anymore. I’m sorry, I’m ranting I don’t really care if anyone reads this or responds, I just need to know that I am saying it out loud. He almost killed me, but I survived. I fought to survive. And I lived.

There were some red marks on my neck afterwards but they faded in a couple of hours. I don't think my throat hurt yesterday, but today it does.

But I have the list of concerning symptoms to watch for following a strangulation and none of them apply. I can't waste time going and waiting just for them to say they see no bruise so it must be okay.

I want to say somethings about this man (not to make you have sympathy) but it's good to mention. He has severe mental health issues. I don't think he understands to the full extent what's about to happen to him or what he has done. This is why I feel extremely guilty. I feel like I have handed him over to a system that I know is not built to protect him or help him. He is a black man with mental health issues , I know inside the system he is not going to get the support he needs and that makes me sick to my stomach. I have begged and pleaded for him to seek professional help and take medication if needed but he never does or lies about going to therapy to try and get me back. He also doesn't have any family to support him either , he does not get along with his family. His family is basically where he works. He got arrested in-front of his peers and bosses. I feel like I have ruined his life.

 How do I stop feeling this way? Has anyone reported their abuser and felt this way before? I could really use advice. I am terrified I will repeat the cycle of dropping the charges when the district attorney calls me.",2025-02-12 15:52:30,2025-03-17 16:35:52,strangle

We have been off and on because our relationship has been rocky and he has slipped back into some verbally abusive tendencies before which made me fear that I would be putting myself in danger to stay with him, and I would cut off contact. Before our relationship ever turned physically violent he has some manipulative tendencies and would say verbally abusive things and play mind games. Since I have been back with him he has seemed like a changed person, at least in the way he treats me, and seems like he genuinely wants to fix our relationship and be there for our baby girl. I can’t ever imagine him harming our baby and I’ve seen how good he is with kids, and he partially raised his little brother. I want to do what’s best for our daughter and have him in her life if he really is changed and won’t hurt us, but I’m scared I’m making the wrong decision and he will eventually hurt me again, or worse; hurt her. How long was it after the first incident of physical abuse that it happened again for anyone else who has been through this? It’s been about 4 months since he strangled me and made me fear for my life and nothing like that has happened since, it was the first time he ever laid a finger on me, and I know 4 months is not enough time to truly change, am I making a huge mistake to stay with him?

1h51eub,"Was this system exploitative? My ex had a cuck kink and I tried it out. I admit I enjoyed being eaten out or talking to men for validation, but I wasn’t really into casual intercourse. I was shy on calls. My friends say this was still creepy and predatory of him, are they overreacting??? I’m sorry. ",mysteryfairylove,12,37,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h51eub,"His biggest defenses or excuses are it was consensual and we both wanted to try it even if he first introduced it and implemented it. I did get raped intercourse wise once due to the kink. I was eaten out without my consent another time. And there was a time I felt pressure to have sex with someone I told ahead that I only wanted to be eaten out from… I got an STI that was so painful, we thought I had appendicitis and went to the emergency room. 

The hospital initially thought it was just a bad bladder infection, but after being recommended to a specialist - they feared I had ovarian cancer due to messed up blood results? I then asked for an STI panel and they told me I had contracted chlamydia. I had my blood drawn a lot to get the medicine required to cure both of us, my ex experienced 0 symptoms of it. But they said I still might have cancerous blood. I spent a month worried I might have cancer due to the delayed appointment. Luckily I didn’t and I was cured of the STI. But it was pretty traumatic. 

He argues that he “begged us to stop” the cuck stuff after I was harmed, but I “begged us” to keep trying due to wanting to relive my trauma in a healthier seeming way with men who listened to my boundaries? As a coping mechanism. My friends think if he truly wanted to stop, he would have though. He was still cumming and sexually benefiting or gaining gratification more from it? He wasn’t in the room when I was raped, but he waited outside in his car and didn’t know better I suppose. Although he admits he heard me screaming. He thought it was just kinky which it was, until it wasn’t. The penetrative rape was so fast. 

I guess part of why I talked to people behind his back after is I started to feel unsafe and unprotected. I wonder if it’s my fault since I told him he doesn’t have to beat the guy up, but I wanted him to deep down because how else was I going to feel safe? He says he regrets it deeply that he never did. He encouraged me to meet the guy (among other old abusers) later on, even though he never fully let it happen. I develop traumatic kinks and fetishize my own trauma as a way to survive so I remember being numb the following day and saying he should let me see the guy who hurt me again. He found it hot, but promised me he would never let me see him again. I guess the point is he knew I’m susceptible to Stockholm syndrome and trauma bonding?

I’ve made a lot of mistakes in this relationship too. Breaking down and screaming like I’m insane. Self harming or feeling suicidal. Repeatedly lying about talking to my ex or others (although that was confusing or blurry for me considering the guy I was with had a cuck kink and had full access to my phone….). I also saved 700 points I have not gotten to spend. He offered to pay me $400 to make up for it since he broke up with me, but I said that’s like paying me off even though the point was for sentimental redemption with dates + quality time?? He said he will never offer it again then.

I think it is important to mention he did take me out on some very nice dates and gave me a lot of gifts or fed me any way “for free” or without spending points. I am grateful for all of that. And I am sorry for any time I “threatened to kill myself” from the trauma or “emotionally manipulated” / controlled him to stay ?? Although I always told him to only be with me if he really wants to be with me too….I think I felt like I couldn’t survive without him after everything I went through for him. I wanted it to amount to being soulmates?

I still self blame for him leaving often or hate myself for supposedly emotionally “cheating” on him. Although I was never having intercourse with or dating any one behind his back really. And I struggle with wondering if we are both abusers even if if he’s done worse. Such as strangling me until I passed out for a few seconds?, hitting, bruising, “accidental” gaslighting, “unintentional” rape. I think I am also to  blame because I would feel suicidal and tell him he should kill me or beat me so I get what I deserve. My friends think he took advantage of my mental illness? He said he was scared someone else would do it if he didn’t. I even said that a few times due to trying to turn on his kink. Idk if I made him hit me or hurt me ? I’m not sure if it’s justified he’s discarded me and ghosted after promising we are friends? I wonder if this system really is as predatory as people have been telling me it might be. Thank you.

I was very close to my boyfriend we were practically joined at the hip. He always been very kind and gentle and last night all hell broke lose-all over a beer. This is stupid but I've been sharing my beer with him and this time I hid one for myself. He came over and had the nerve to go through my fridge in my home chug my beer and plopped my last empty can in front of me calling me a selfish bitch. I was doing a hard workout and haven't seen him do this. I told him he could have asked first. We always shared our stuff but this felt like crossing major boundaries. He then shoved his sandwich in my face, hand over my mouth smearing and shoving this sandwich all over my face and chest. I was in so much shock it took me a few seconds to register that he was actually rubbing a garlic cheese sandwich in my face. He then tried to smother me. When I finally managed to break free I screamed that he had no right to do all that to me he said I DESERVED it all and to shut up. I begged and cried for him to leave. He then tried to strangle me and shoved more food in my face calling me a fat worthless greedy drunken bitch. I only had 2. I never felt so degraded. I used to have an eating disorder and had just went up 3 inches on my waist and upper thighs sizes so having food shoved and smeared in my face........after him preaching pretty at every size, body positivity, it's okay to be big, stop being so paranoid about your size etc, I'm shocked and devastated. 

regardless he grabbed me super roughly and smeared food all over me. I was gagging and fighting for air. 

All over one can of beer. Stupid. I never want to see him again. I used to be emotionally abused before by my narcissist ex and bullied a lot growing up. I cried all night. Yes I'm looking into recovery. I'm scared of him now. I've been going through a lot with my mental health lately so this was another very difficult situation on top of it. I'm just really shocked as he never abused me once before. He's the type of person to never apologize so I told him to never come by me again. He kept saying it was my fault.

If I flinch, look frightened for a moment, or ask him why he's doing it, he will tell me that I'm too sensitive, paranoid, am no fun, and complain about how he can't even joke/play around with me without me massively overreacting.

so, the idea of me “making him like this” has been a common theme in our relationship. he basically says i was mentally unstable since the beginning and i pushed him this far, and that i am actually the abusive one. this has always been confusing for me because i was mentally unstable when we got together, and i actually did hit him first, so he’s always been able to use that against me. he fails to remember that i hit him because for months of me crying for him to stop looking at other women online, he just laughed in my face and called me crazy over and over.

She told me they got into an argument because he liked some girls picture on instagram, and they started to argue. So he choked her out while their 2 kids were sleeping, left her unconscious in their apartment, stole her car, and left her for dead. She told me the only time he doesn’t put his hands on her is when she’s pregnant. 😕 

I actually didn’t know this was a normal thing for her then I remembered actually seeing her with a busted lip before but she blamed it on her toddler son. There was another incident when he showed up to our job, and was looking for her and she was hiding from him. Anyways, after he almost killed her on Mother’s Day I told her to leave him because he could’ve killed her, and left their kids without a mother. Honestly, I believe he was trying to kill her. He didn’t stop until she lost consciousness that sounds exactly like attempted murder to me. Eventually he won her back by I guess love bombing her, and buying her stuff to get her back. It’s literally a cycle. Im still very concerned for her well being because she’s having another baby by this abuser, and I fear he will continue to abuse her. I truly believe he only continues to get her pregnant to keep her stuck, and unable to leave. She has told me before she would struggle really bad without him. I am worried one day he will kill her, and leave their kids without a mother. I tried to give her solutions. I even told her we could go in on an apartment together because she deserves so much better. But I know trying to get her to leave will only result in me getting cut off as a friend and I do genuinely care about her. My old best friend is in a similar situation and cut me off because I tried to get her to leave her abuser. 


Anyways, just wanted to vent about the situation close to me. I hope her, and the babies are safe everyday.

He strangled me so hard nonstop for 20 minutes on and off the whole car ride home, his cousins in the front seat acted like they didn’t see anything going on and kept saying “bruh chill.” He dropped me off a mile from home and I left. I filed a police report the next day. I still had marks on my neck, he said he was going to kill me, and I fully lost my consciousness multiple times.

My (23M) partner and I (22F), have been together for 2 years. 
We were practically living together from the beginning, but we officially moved in together on January. That same month, I found out I was pregnant and decided to keep the baby.
This pregnancy wasn’t planned but I am so happy that I went with it. I gave birth to our son in October so he’s not even 1 month yet. 

The thing is, since January, we have been arguing. And every time, it gets worse. I never saw him mad like this before so I couldn’t have suspected it. 
The first time it happened, he said to me that one day he’d kill him and I would have to live with the guilt of it. 
The second time he banged his head against a wall out of anger. 
The third time he tried to cut his wrists but I stopped him and I don’t think he wanted to hurt himself badly.

When I was 6 months pregnant, he strangled me during an argument and I’ve been terrified since then.
Also while pregnant, I couldn’t handle the stress. Every time he would get angry I would just leave and try not to stress out otherwise I would have really bad contractions. I often asked him not to yell but he wouldn’t calm down until I got mad myself. 

The day I came home from the maternity, he slapped me for the first time. I was on the couch with the baby and he was in front of me, yelling. I asked repeatedly “Please, stop. Don’t talk loudly in front of the baby”. Wouldn’t stop. He approached me, still yelling, so I put my feet in front of him to keep him at a distance. I saw that he tried to strangle me,but I moved, so he slapped me in the face. Later he said it was because I was “acting crazy in front of the baby”, so he was afraid I’d hurt him. 


Tonight, I put baby in the carrier and go for a walk with him. We argued for something silly but I don’t want any screaming or anything bc of baby and also, I’m really tired of arguing with him as it leads nowhere. I tell him to go home, I’ll walk by myself.

Outside it’s cold, and inside the apartment SO hot. When I come home I remove the carrier and crash on the couch. I was feeling so bad that I couldn’t see.  
Bf takes the baby, who starts crying as I go outside in the cold to feel better.  Seconds later I hear him yell my name, so I get in. I take the baby and say he’s stupid, I almost passed out so he could at least keep the baby for 5 minutes. 
He yells as loud as he can “Just take the baby ! Stop being a stupid girl ! Just do your fucking job !” 
He was just next to us. 
I’m afraid the baby will be impacted by all of the yelling. 
I’m afraid it will only get worse. I’m scared for myself. 


He will always come back and apologize and say how he loves me and stuff. 
Everything outside of that is pure gold. We laugh, we can talk about anything, we’re a good team with the baby. 

My family loves him. My friends love him and so do I. 
We have plans. We have an apartment together. 
I don’t have any money atm, he works but I stopped at the end of my pregnancy. 
I just feel stuck. I need help. 
I want to make it better, but is it even possible ?
I want my son to have a dad who’s present. 

Please help.",2023-11-09 19:19:22,2025-03-17 16:36:16,strangle

I didn’t answer any of the calls. I’m an emotional wreck knowing he’s looking at years in prison. I know it’s deserved but it’s like loosing my best friend even tho he’s abusive. 



So my abusive boyfriend, I love him so much and I know he’s been through a lot but anytime we argue or we have a disagreement he loses self control. Whether it’s from throwing things and breaking my windshield or taking things and being very sporadic like running away sleeping outside to guilt trip me or, literally jumping out of a moving car. But things escalated in 2023 when he strangled me twice during a argument because I was mad and also started loading BB gun bullets never shot me but my things weren’t safe. Long story short a year went by with just emotional abuse It’s hard for me to trust him because he *was* a PA (he claimed he stopped haven’t found anything so idk)  and I anytime I ask him QUESTIONS he gets very angry or if I’m feeling insecure.  I had a cheating dream and was sad and just kinda lost it I told him I knew he was cheating or something sneaky going on and I wanted to get my things and leave. He got really angry tried to run away from me to keep ky Xbox n things but I went Into the house and started grabbing my items and he kept tackling me with neck grabs where I couldn’t breathe. Not once but 3 times til the point I called 911 and had to go get medicine for my neck. I feel really bad bc he’s talking about how he could go to jail for a long time and he wants me to tell the courts to dismiss this case (I already dismissed one) and idk deep down I don’t want him to go to jail but I also don’t want to die. And when he’s angry idk… I called the police everytime out of sheer fear not trying to get him in trouble but he did say he’ll fix my windshield but when he’s mad he’s like I’m not doing that. So idk I’m conflicted his family said I’m after him but that’s not true I’m just scared so I call the police n give my statement. But afterwards of course it’s nothing but love and good times to the point of im familiar with him and im not really interested in anyone else. But I don’t want to end up like gabby petito. 


Help with advice for my mental health because I’m so confused and torn there’s nothing I can do about the statement I made. But I feel so so bad about it but another part of me doesn’t. He was part of my everything wake up talk to him n we’re together til the end of the day so it feels like withdrawals? Idk. 








TLDR/ abusive ex apologized for choking me bt it’s his 3rd incident but I feel bad for calling the cops. ",2025-02-16 16:48:29,2025-03-17 16:36:17,strangle
192kxnc,I Feel Like Almost Everyone Failed Me,thee_runningrebel,121,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/192kxnc/i_feel_like_almost_everyone_failed_me/,"I posted here the other day about trying to go ghost after he strangled me on New Year's Eve. I ended up communicating with him again because of all the threats so I figured that trying to make peace would keep me or anyone else I care about from getting hurt. Everything was calm until he strangled me again on Sunday. This time, I felt like I was going to die. I had to fight him off to stay conscious. Then, he held me hostage for at least an hour--could not leave his sight, shower, drink water, or have access to any of my belongings (including my phone, wallet, or keys). I finally was able to get away when he wasn't looking. I contacted the police and he now has felony warrants out and the EMTs took me to the hospital. I spent all day there l getting checked out and when I was discharged, I returned home to find him locked inside my apartment with the police unable to get him to come out. I needed a safe place to sleep for the night until I could contact management to get me a key the next morning.

Instead of taking me to a DV shelter (like I believed they were), the police took me to a substance use/mental health facility. I never felt so out of place and alone. Granted, these facilities are necessary for people who need them but the thing is... I DIDN'T. I was subjected to a naked ""skin assessment"", had to give up all my belongings, I was drug tested, had to do multiple substance use and suicide screenings, had to do multiple medical assessments and vitals despite being at the hospital all day, had to do a psychiatric evaluation, was told I should start medication when I've never needed to. I couldn't sleep in my own clothes. I wasn't given any opportunity to speak to a crisis counselor or advocate for DV. No speak of my legal options (besides the criminal warrants). I was treated like a person with a psychiatric and substance use issue when all I needed was a safe place to sleep for the night and space to process what happened to me. On top of all of that, I had to spend almost 2 hours on the bus to get home when I was discharged because there was nothing in place for transport. 

I'm so angry. In less than 24 hours, I had to re-tell what happened to me at least 7 times. The police seemed more concerned with issuing a warrant and arresting him than ensuring I had the proper resources. The staff at the facility (while kind) unintentionally traumatized me more. So now, I have to process this lack of agency I feel along with the most recent incident of abuse. I was only trying to do the best thing for myself and keep myself safe.

Rant over. I'm just so tired of how law enforcement and people in other community settings are ill informed about DV and what survivors need and just let us slip through the cracks. 

I know I can't be the only one.",2024-01-09 17:59:36,2025-03-17 16:36:18,strangle
1hf9gvs,Pregnant in an abusive relationship ,Original_Debt_6455,6,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hf9gvs/pregnant_in_an_abusive_relationship/,"Hi guys, I need some advice and support. 
I've been dating my boyfriend for over a year, first 6 months of dating I was working, had a job at a car dealership, I was making good money but all my coworkers were males. My boyfriend was feeling extremely jealous and we broke up a few times because of that. He called me a flirt only because I smile when meet customers some of whom happen to be males. 

After a few months of dating I found out that he had a baby with his ex-girlfriend and he wanted to take the baby from her and get full custody. Once she left the baby with him for 2 weeks and he didn't give the baby back, now they are fighting in court. 

So the point is, he convinced me to quit my job to move in with him and help him take care of the baby until he turns 12 months and can go to daycare. I agreed because I wanted to complete some educational courses and change my career. Of course when his baby turned 1 year old he didn't send him to daycare and I had to keep taking care of him on my own. There were times when he would go on a business trip for 2 weeks and I would stay alone with the baby. Every time I asked him about daycare, we would have an argument. Also he would call me lazy all the time and even useless. One time he didn't like my soup so he spit into my face, kicked me out of the apartment and told me that this happened to me because I don't know how to ""f### cook"". 

I didn't have any place to stay, so I stayed at the hotel for a night and then came back because I didnt have money to afford staying at the hotel for a few days looking for a room to rent. And I didnt have a car so taking uber to move my stuff was also too expensive. I came back. And in a few weeks we had an argument again. 

All those 6 months we were sleeping on the floor, without a mattress, just on blankets and he was blaming me for that, because I couldn't choose the one I liked (lie, I told him which one I wanted, but he didn't like it). His brother was supposed to come next week and my boyfriend started to look for furniture. He asked me if we needed a dining table and I asked if he wanted to buy it for us or because of his brother. That's when it started. He was yelling at me, calling me names, calling me stupid and when I started to cry, he said I was acting like a child and I'm stupid and annoying. Next day in the morning, he continued calling me names and stuff. I said I was done with it and that I was going to leave. He took a knife and cut my suitcase in peaces, kicked it and told me to collect my stuff in trash bags and leave immediately. While I was collecting my stuff and crying he was still yelling at me and he told me if I don't shut up and the neighbors would call the cops, he would kill me. 

I couldn't control myself anymore. I said that I hated him. He said I hate you more and started to strangle me,  I was trying to break free, i was begging him to stop. I was 100% sure he would kill me, then he brought me into the kitchen, took a knife and hit my head with a handle of a knife. Painful but not dangerous. I was scared, I was shocked, couldn't stop crying. He asked me what I was going to do and I said nothing. He calmed down then and left. Came back after a few minutes with a chocolate bar and was trying to have sex with me and I was afraid to say no. I was just crying. He stopped and left saying okay it's not the bast moment. 

Since then I started to look for a new place and also for a nanny for the baby. So I could leave without telling him. I arranged everything, but then found out I was pregnant. I told him, he was happy. Then I told him that I didn't want to stay at home with his baby because after 9 months I will have to do the same and it's too hard. He told me to start paying half the expenses the same moment. We had an argument and he stopped talking to me. I packed my stuff and left. 

And now I don't know what to do next. I don't have anyone in the country, no family , no friends, he isolated me from everyone I knew and could ask for help or advice. He also smashed the phone with all my contacts. I'm still very early in my pregnancy and I took a few HCG tests and they looked a bit concerning, so I'm not sure if the pregnancy is going to develop well. For now I'm looking for a job and waiting for my doctor's appointment. He suggested to have lunch together and I agreed, but he didn't make it on time (he didn't even leave his apartment when I was already there) so I left. He said he would come and pick me and my stuff up and I said no. He told me to ""go f## myself"". I can't stop crying. Any advice. Please ",2024-12-16 02:53:25,2025-03-17 16:36:20,strangle

""Boyfriend put a pillow over my face during an argument. (F18) (M19)""


So our relationship isn't the best, I mean he really does annoy me and I really do annoy him but sometimes I question if I should leave or not. I love him too much to actually leave.

Our argument started because he called me a b*tch because I upset him, so I turned over and told him to not touch or talk to me to which his response was to touch me with his feet. I moved away and he kept touching me, this repeated for about 10-20 minutes.

(This is for later, but he usually does this thing when he gets upset at me and he repeats 'You're mad.' Over and over to aggrivate me.)

After his constant pestering and me wanting to be alone he then goes on his phone to which I then start saying, 'You're mad.' 

This didn't go well.

He called me ugly and fat and single and that he wanted me to pack my bags and leave. (I live in his house 4 hours away from my parents.) I just kept saying it though because I was really pissed off.

He then grabbed a pillow and smashed it against my face for 30 seconds with it and I couldn't breath at all. I was so scared and wanted to cry, this is a new thing for him too, he's never done this before.
After that, the argument continued until he did it again but harder.
I know I made him angry but I'm not sure on what to do.

Also I've asked him many times to not call me a b*tch and in this argument he did it twice. He's called me fat and ugly before and he's strangled me (Not hard enough or long enough to cause damage.)

I've called him names before but usually after he does which isn't right or okay, and when he put the pillow on my face I grabbed him hard and kicked him.

This is as much as I can recollect from the moment. I just don't know what to do anymore.

tl;dr

Boyfriend puts pillow over my face in a heated argument and incouldnt breath and I don't know what to do.",2024-03-18 16:20:56,2025-03-17 16:36:21,strangle

He grabbed my hair and slammed my hair several times against wall leaving huge huge bump and also taking some hair out 

During this I hit out and struck his face leaving big black eye.

Threw me out car in road (because I found out he had cheated) with my stuff 

Now he’s gone round everyone and recorded this big black eye

The police have already been shit to me. Last time they were called because he strangled me he managed to twist it around.

I have no help. He knows it.

1ixz8co,"Pregnant with abusive partner, I don’t know what to do…",Time_Background9589,7,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ixz8co/pregnant_with_abusive_partner_i_dont_know_what_to/,"    I’ve been in an extremely toxic, unhealthy relationship for the past two years. A bit of context, I met him while I was going through addiction to m*th and experiencing homelessness. I quit cold turkey when we met. In the first 6 months, it was fine. We lived with his roommate, then separated because his roommate’s wife didn’t want me living there. He wasn’t abusive then. I went to live with my mother who kicked me out, lived with her for a year until she kicked me out again, even though I was working. We reunited and I moved in with him while he was renting a room. This is when the horror for me started. We would get into arguments over silly things. It’s honestly kind of hard to remember what because I believed I blocked those memories out. This is when he started to be physically abusive. Despite living right next to other men, he would verbally and physically attack me. He strangled me several times within the first two months of us staying there. I literally peed myself and lost consciousness (which I didn’t even know until he brought up) 

    I’m ashamed to say that instead of getting help or helping myself like getting a job I stayed in this awful situation, unemployed and drinking to cope with the abuse occasionally. I felt stuck. He also was extremely verbally abusive. He’s said some evil, sick things to me. Told me he was going to murder me and throw me in a ditch, said he slept with other women, even my sister who he never met, told me I was worthless, retarded, a junkie, a m*thhead, told me sell my body for drugs, spitting in my face at grocery stories and home, etc….the list goes on. He has been verbally abusive to me hundreds of times. My mental health has seriously declined since being with him. We had the cops come so many times, and I never filed a police report on him for fear of my own safety. 

While living in this apartment, the abuse has gotten worse. He has strangled me several times again, beat the living daylights out of me for relapsing despite me remaining sober for a long time, kicked my feet from under me, slapped me, backhanded me, shoved his fingers in my mouth and used his nails to scratch my gums til they’re bleeding and almost felt like my gums were shredded, slammed my leg in the door until it was black and blue for weeks, smashed my finger into his phone (I can’t even bend my index finger anymore), and slapped me so hard (recently) that I’m seeing white spots in my eyes. I’m worried it will get worse…I can’t tell you how badly this has worn me down. I genuinely feel like nothing but a worthless, stupid, junkie

    I had a job briefly after we moved into an apartment, but it didn’t last. Not due to our relationship, but my manager didn’t like me I assume. I did my job, and tried to socialize but I’ve always been an outcast. After I quit, (they completely took me off the schedule for 3 weeks), I remained unemployed. My self esteem is so destroyed…Shortly after this, I relapsed on m*th. I was sober for nearly two years. I couldn’t handle the abuse anymore. He literally would tell me, in his fit of rage and evilness, to overdose, go smoke m*th, and I did. 

I’m ashamed to say it but he has put me through so much trauma and abuse, I needed an outlet. I continued to use for 7 months, not day in and day out, but I became addicted again. Until I found out I was pregnant. I stopped using when I started having symptoms like nausea. Please don’t judge me too hard….I tried to leave him so many times before it got to this point. But he would apologize and say he would change.  I would be adamant that I don’t want to be with him, but he wouldn’t accept that. And I stayed because I have nobody. No friends or no family who would help me out. We have been having unprotected s*x for two years and I honestly thought I was infertile. I told him I didn’t want to have s*x anymore because of how he treated me but he still would not listen and go ahead anyways. 

Now here I am, pregnant and he has hurt me still. He slammed my door in the leg as I mentioned previously for trying to get my personal items that he takes off with. He has smashed my head in the wall (not very hard but still), and I did hit him once when he called me retarded out of rage. I was just so angry, but I shouldn’t have done that because now I have a potential eye injury. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m having suicidal thoughts. I don’t have any family. He supports me, but I can’t take this no more. I’m probably 3-4 months pregnant, and am faced with having an abortion but don’t have any money. I love my baby, but I don’t know how I will be able to take care of it. I’m not even taking care of myself. Any advice or any words of encouragement would help me tremendously. I have nobody and I’m suffering all by myself…Thanks to anyone who is listening.",2025-02-25 16:36:04,2025-03-17 16:36:23,strangle
1gyfsdx,Ex bf upset I didn't message him,Vengeful-Sorrow247,21,20,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gyfsdx,"I didn't know how to title it. This was January 2023.

So I was staying with my ex bf after he was discharged from a mental health hospital end of 2022. When I was looking after him, my mother fell into a coma on New year's eve and was in the for nearly a month. I visited her nearly every day. When my mother did wake up from her coma and was stable, she was moved to a different ward where there was no signal. She needed help walking and bathing herself and didn't like the nurses. I was also my mother's carer.

He would constantly message me while I was with her, if I didn't reply quick enough he would threaten to kill himself and I would have to talk him down from it, call an ambulance. 

On Jan 17, he beat me. He was mad that it took me so long to cook and eat _(I had a long important phone call, he knew this)._ He didn't want to look at me, said that I wanted him to starve so I went to the living room and the door accidentally slammed shut. My hands was full with my food. By the time I put it down, he rushed into the room, screaming ""how dare I slam doors in his house"". He punched and kicked my head and back while I begged him to stop. Kicked my food everywhere, broke glass, punched his walls. I was only wearing a dressing gown and he pulled it off me, tried to strangle me with it and left me naked on the floor while he went around destroying his flat. His windows were wide open. I was terrified. Banging his head against the walls yelling that he's going to kill himself. When neighbours tried to knock he told them to fuck off then went to hit me again. Saying that this is my fault, look what I made him do and how I want to get him arrested like all his other exes. Multiple neighbours and passersby called the police.

 When they came, we told them he was having a mental health crisis and that he didn't hurt me. I couldn't go see my mother that day, it was too late. He went to the hospital and I stayed, cleaning up his mess. He was in the hospital overnight and most of the day. I stayed up until 12pm, I was just in shock about it all. My body was aching. My head hurt. Emotionally I was numb. I had a short nap and then rushed to see my mother in the new ward. I wasn't focusing on him. It was the best I felt in so long. Me and my mother were chatting, I helped her walk around her room, eat and bathed her. I just didn't want to leave her when it was time. He tried calling and texting me but there was no signal. 

While he was texting me, I was snappy with him. I was still upset about the day before. I didn't do what I normally do when I forget to text which is me sending a big paragraph explaining everything I did from the moment I woke up in detail, how I forgot to message because I was busy, apologising, telling him I love him and using pet names etc.

I called an ambulance and couldn't answer him because I was on the phone to them. He always gets upset with me when I call them. I gave the opperator his number and I waited on his road for an hour or so until they arrived because I was terrified of what he would do to me alone because I gave him attitude. I just couldn't stop crying. I didn't want to go in because I never know what side of him I'll see. Especially since he drank and probably was in another destructive, violent mood 

Anytime I feel like I miss him, I'm going to write about about the things he did to me. I need to remind myself what sort of person he is.",2024-11-24 01:45:49,2025-03-17 16:36:25,strangle
1ii4uc0,I feel crazy and lost (advice please),AmIManipulated,4,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ii4uc0/i_feel_crazy_and_lost_advice_please/,"I (21F) live with my fiancé (22M). We have been together for a little under 2 1/2 years. We’ve had a really rocky relationship from the start. At the beginning of the relationship, I went to watch a movie with him at his apartment and found out that he was roommates with (and didn’t like) someone that I had previously been with a couple months prior and I did not tell him this information. Until about a year ago he would find every reason to degrade me and not trust me an ounce. He went through my phone almost everyday, told me what I could/couldn’t wear, made me dump friends, and wouldn’t allow me to pick new ones. All while convincing me that I was to blame. Please note that he got kicked out of his apartment about 2 months into our relationship and had no where to go so my parents allowed him to live in their home with me so all of this was happening in their home. I got fed up and almost left him and he told me he would fix it. Honestly, shockingly enough he did. Everything was great. My parents eventually did not want him living there anymore though and he moved to his sister’s apartment. This is where things get bad again. He tells me that he doesn’t trust me enough to have a “long distance relationship” (we would’ve been 1 hour apart) and that I can move with him or we can break up. So, being naive i move with him. He left out that his sister lived in a 2 bedroom apartment with 2 kids and roaches. I was sleeping on his sister’s couch with him for months horrified of these bugs. Now don’t get me wrong I used to go camping and I am not prissy but there was an ungodly amount of these things. All throughout this, I am working and trying to provide for us, let him have some things he wants, and save. He starts looking through my phone again, spam calling me at work because I had male coworkers, and yelling at me in front of his sister and her kids and making me seem awful. I got tired again, tried to leave but I no longer had a support system and was scared to be alone. He fixes everything again and goes on to act like an incredible boyfriend. He gets a job and starts contributing to finances, I switch jobs and he supports me while I job search, he’s doing everything perfectly. We save up enough to finally get our own place but at this point I’m skeptical and bring up my concerns with him about his previous behavior and how this is a big commitment for me to sign that I will live with him for a year. We both came to an agreement that if something goes wrong (other than cheating) whoever moves out will be whoever was in the wrong and they will help pay rent until a roommate is found. Recently though, he’s started putting his hands on me. He’s been physically restraining me from moving and blocking doorways for about a year now. But he has started kicking me and slapping me. I have tried multiple things to help him calm down before we get to the point of this as I can now see when it is about to happen but nothing helps. It got to a peak 2 days ago when we were arguing (I don’t even remember what about honestly) and he knocked my phone out of my hand. I got upset and kept asking him to please sit down and asking him to take a second to himself if he needs time. He is in my face yelling at me and eventually lightly punch my rib. I screamed because I am honestly very scared of him at this point and didn’t know what else to do. He proceeded to lunge forward and hold me down and my first response was that I was scared and I needed to fight back and get out so I did what I thought would do the most damage and I grabbed him parts and squeezed. Unfortunately, he is a black belt and a trained martial artist so this honestly did nothing but anger him more. He grabbed my face and my neck, covered my mouth, and choked me to the point that I almost passed out and could see lights around me when I finally opened my eyes. This also left a bruise on my face from how hard he was pressing against it. He proceeded to walk away. I start crying and go to the room to get appropriately dressed and he starts crying and begging and saying he’s sorry and that he’s knows it was wrong. Now, mind you I have seen this man cry 2-3 times. Once when his brother moved away and again when his dad was going through a really, really hard time. I am exhausted and confused and accept his apology because I feel like I’m in denial. He promised that he will never do it again. I’ve been giving his the stiff arm for days as my head honestly feels cloudy. Like I’ve been doing things with him… watching movies, gaming, etc. but we haven’t really talked much. He has been doing everything for me and constantly apologizing. Tonight I was gaming and I went to my friends list to invite him to a gaming party and he saw a name on there that I guess he thought was new.  He asked who it was and I responded telling him that it was a girl from social media that had said she wanted more women to game with but that we had different game modes we enjoyed so we hadn’t played together yet. He goes on to ask her race, age, name, to see the video of her saying that she wanted girl gamers, how many messages we had, if he could see the messages, etc. I, very annoyed answer these questions but eventually draw the line when he asks to see the messages as I feel that he has already gone way too far for the situation with the questions he asked alone. All of this is happening while I am already in a game. This upsets him and he walks over and turns my console off. Now, this game is a multiplayer fps and they take bans and reports VERY seriously. Players know this and if you leave a match they will absolutely report you. He also knows this very well as it is a game he plays and we report people for abandoning matches every time. So I turn my console on and continue to slightly play while also attempting to pay enough attention to him. He takes my controller, which he accidentally unmuted. All of this while yelling at me and degrading me. I take my controller back, my team just heard everything he said which first off is humiliating but I let them know that I have to leave and ask them not to report me. Before I can do anything else he takes my controller AGAIN, and leaves the game and turns my console off again. Now all of that feels extremely controlling to me but to top it off he continued to take my phone and just hold them. I ask him to just give them back and I’ll put them beside me and he doesn’t so I attempt to take my things back as I don’t like the control imbalance that it displays. Apparently, I scraped his hand in my attempt and he lunged at me and held me down again while shaking and yelling in my face. My arm is bruised from how hard he squeezed it and I don’t know how to feel. He again immediately apologized for doing everything and promised it wouldn’t happen again. He said that it set him off and he thought that I had intentionally scratched him. He apologized for doing it either way because it was acceptable in any circumstance and also apologized for taking my phone, controller, and turning off my console. I am currently in the car typing all of this as I told him that I am deciding if I can continue this relationship. I know that it’s wrong but I honestly do love him and I do care about him so much. I want to be with him but I feel so scared when he’s angry and so nervous even when he’s not. I honestly don’t know what to do, I don’t have any friends to call for advice or help and I have no idea if it will get worse or better. I feel like this instance isn’t big enough to leave over the more I think about it. Please give me any advice you have or words of wisdom. I am again only 21 with a foggy mind right now and this is my first big relationship so please be kind even if you think the solution is obvious. ",2025-02-05 07:35:41,2025-03-17 16:36:26,strangle
1iq4qat,I'm not happy but I'm scared of leaving,Adventurous_Act_6080,2,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1iq4qat/im_not_happy_but_im_scared_of_leaving/,"Hello,

I have been in a relationship for five years with a man, but we have known each other for longer. It wasn’t the healthiest relationship at the beginning (cheating and lies on his part). But I always let it slide due to my emotional dependency. Today, I am sure he is no longer cheating on me.

However, he has a serious problem with alcohol, and he often becomes violent—mostly verbally, but once physically. He often threatens to hit me (but doesn’t do it), punches walls, and screams. One time, he tried to strangle me to scare me because I ""wouldn’t shut up""... But when he doesn’t drink, he’s not like that.

The problem is that now that I’ve opened my eyes to my emotional dependency, I can no longer ignore it. On top of that, I’m struggling financially and can’t find a job. I can’t leave him because I’m afraid of ending up on the street. Also, my family loves him. But most of all, I still love him, and I don’t know what to do...

We have plans to get married and have children. But I’m afraid I will never know what happiness is. I have never felt truly happy... I don’t think happiness is meant for me.

I don’t know what to do. I feel lost. Do you have any advice? I have no one to talk to...

1j4bqzv,Emotionally Abusive and Custody,ChewsFoodOnlyTwice,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1j4bqzv/emotionally_abusive_and_custody/,"Hey guys

So my husband has been emotionally abusive for years. We went to therapy and it seemed to fix it but then it came back full force after I had our baby. Now I am finally at a place where I want to leave. It has gotten so bad. But I know that I won't get full custody. We will split custody 50/50 of our small infant. Has anyone split custody with someone that was emotionally abusive to you and how did you handle it? He is using the baby as leverage to stay married. He knows I don't want to split custody and he is using that to basically keep me in the marriage. 

Back story of the abuse. It was emotional, psychological and verbal. I have record of a lot of the verbal and journal entries of the psychological. He doesn't work. He is a stay at home dad and I take care of all the expenses. He has been blowing our savings. I have tried confronting him about this gently and he would deflect, shut down, not talk about it. So I redirected our money into a bank account that's only in my name and took him off my credit cards as an authorized user. He still found ways to pressure me into buying him stuff. Wearing me down until I just didn't care anymore. 

I then asked him to get a job so that he could financially contribute and he wouldn't. Still refuses to even talk to me about it. 

A couple months postpartum he flew into a rage because I said I didn't want the baby to go to the park and he left me working from home without childcare for the day. It was hard. When he got back he went into the basement and didn't come back up. He asked me to leave something on the stairs for him and I called him out on his childish behavior. Then he flew into a rage at me in our bedroom where our newborn was sleeping. I told him to keep it down but he got louder. I was really scared hovering over our sleeping infant crying. I told him to get out of the doorway because he was blocking me in. He got even more mad saying that he wasn't threatening me and I was over reacting. Then he got closer. I was turned away from him and he put his hand on my arm to get my attention and I blurted out ""If you put your hands on me I'm calling the police"" he then got very angry and called his mom and told her that I falsely accused him of abuse and threatened to put him in jail because he wanted to take our kid to the park. He then went on a month long crusade telling everyone and anyone who would listen that I was falsely accusing him of abuse and that I was manipulative and controlling. Once during a couples counseling session while I was recounting the events he shouted at me that I was full of shit and a liar and that I was making it all up. I decided to take some space from him and moved out if our shared bedroom. 

The 3 months after that have been the biggest mind fuck I could possibly imagine. He started recording our conversations for ""therapy"" but would put on a pretend nice voice. If he ever lost his cool he wouldn't record that then if I lost my cool (saying things like I don't want to be married to you anymore, this was a mistake, I hate you, get a job, etc.) then he would record that and send it to people to prove that I'm actually the abuser and the manipulative and controlling one. Now he has convinced everyone I know that I'm an abusive person. Has contacted abuse resources. Still insists that I falsely accused him of abuse. Refuses to have conversations about our marriage until I admit and take responsibility for my abusive behavior. On recording of course. It's been so persistent that until I just typed out the situation that happened 4 months ago I had forgotten about it entirely and I'm constantly on the edge of believing him. That I am the problem and if I could just approch topics with calmness instead of demanding that our marriage would be fine. 

I have started giving myself sanity checks throughout the day. This whole experience has been so incredibly destructive to my sense of self that I have devised scripts that I say to him to basically check to make sure I'm not actually just overly emotional and overwhelmed about being 5 months pp trying to float our whole household on my income and that's why he has shut down and refuses to speak to me. 

I will ask him questions in a very casual way devoid of all emotion and see if he reacts the same way to that as when I come to him crying and begging him to hear me out (he usually tells me to go talk to my mom because he can't ""handle you right now""). I note his response and confirm to myself that it isn't the way I approach him. 

Guys I know this is fucked up. I know it's so fucked up. I am in it deep. I know that the only way out is to divorce him. I have consulted with lawyers and they agree that I likely won't get full custody. It will be 50/50. I also know this from my own experience as a child. When my brother was a toddler I witnessed my dad strangling my mother. He was overly physically abusive and would threaten to kill her. It went to court and he was still awarded 50/50 because it wasn't directed at my brother. 

So. I am here. Just getting off the phone with a lawyer about my options for a contested divorce and how much time I can realistically expect to get with my son. Heartbroken. Knowing that if I leave this situation as I should because I am a withering shell of a human being that I will be missing half of the life of the tiny baby I carried inside of me for 9 months and then birthed and loved. The light of my whole life. How did you do it? 

How did you get over that pain. I can take so much pain but the pain of being away from my baby is so intense. It stops me every single time I try to get the divorce moving. ",2025-03-05 19:36:26,2025-03-17 16:36:28,strangle

He strangled me before when he was angry. We got in a fight and I poured his needles on the floor and threaten to call the cops (he is a bodybuilder) and he got angry and strangled me on the closet floor. I almost blacked out.

He can’t handle my emotions and thinks they are annoying and he gets mean and calls me names. I had a surgery today and I am in pain and I needed to rest and I brought up how I was watching the Gabby Petito documentary and it made me nervous and more scared because similar things happened and she ended up dead. He got angry and fought with me and made me cry for 45 minutes and said that he strangled me because I was escalating it and that he acts how he acts because I cry and scream. I cry and scream because he never leaves me alone and can’t stop scaring me with his words. I am not sure what to do because we have been better for months and we are building a life together. I just don’t know if I can ever trust him.  Sometimes when I cry I just need comfort and he cants stop defending himself and arguing with me, even when I just had surgery. I just wanted comfort about what happened in the past, I wanted him to say sorry and hug me and understand why it still affects me so much months later.. Please help me, I don’t have friends and I don’t have much going for me, we were building so much together. ",2025-02-27 06:30:43,2025-03-17 16:36:32,strangle

We have our own rooms. We get into arguments, and I'll admit, I haven't always been the best I can be during arguments. There are times I keep yelling to defend my stance, or have pushed him when he's right there in my space (within an arms length), trying to intimidate me. We disagree on a lot, it's been toxic. And I don't feel like myself when I'm with him, I don't like who I am when I'm around him. Long story short, he's been making death threats, and has told me before he could definitely kill someone. He's an angry drunk, and when he gets too drunk, he gets violent. He's made death threats before but I never took them too seriously, but would also feel kind of scared because I do think he might be capable of it. A few weeks ago, we were arguing and he wrapped his hands around my neck to strangle me, right in front of our 2 year old son. He didn't squeeze, it was more intimidation, but it actually scared me. I've felt uneasy since then. Last night he got too drunk again, and we argued about how loud his music was at bedtime. He pulled out a knife not knowing I could see him, said ""F*** I'm going to kill her"" then stabbed his desk really hard. I said ""I'm calling the police"", then ran to my room. I could hear him come towards my room which scared me, but then he left while I was on the phone with 911. They arrested him. And part of me feels guilty because my son loves him so much and won't be able to see him, he's not always so terrible, he might be in jail for a long time, and he'll probably try and slander me in court. Court scares me, I haven't exactly been meek at all times, hence another reason I haven't reported him before. He can warp a situation and slander me and make things seem like what they're not. Or make people believe he's innocent. He's gotten his family to believe everything he says, he lies A LOT. ",2025-02-24 03:17:01,2025-03-17 16:36:39,strangle

I've never been one for video games , I've played animal crossing a little,  I'll watch people play the Sims but that's it , I don't even have game apps on my phone,  never have. 

Video games are a huge part of his life and always have been and he has desperately tried to get me into them, spending too much money on every console , game or set up imaginable over the years .

  I'm just not into them , don't get me wrong , I've tried... I've played every single kingdom hearts game ( his favourite) as he told me what to do and how to play , I've finished BG3 ,three times now,  me on controls but him directing , every Mario, sonic or pokemon game in the last ten years I've played , not always finished but played , him always directing otherwise I won't play , I'm just not into it...

He's always had gamer rage , always . 
Yelling , mostly,  intense hours long screaming fits that result in him punching himself or the couch and losing his voice at worse .
He'll hold his breath alot too or hit his head against the wall, he'll scream and swear and he's strangled himself a few times in a rage ...always when the game doesn't go well or he loses or whatever. 

I was used to it until we moved in together and it got even worse .

It doesn't matter the game, it doesn't even matter if he is the one playing, or watching me play, sometimes watching me play hes gotten even angrier. He will rage .

For example - he was playing the Bluey game and the game glitches ALOT and he gets upset easily at things like that , but he screamed for long and so loudly I was scared the neighbours would call the police for a noise complaint. It was 11 at night after all and we in an apartment block with lots of families. 

It's not incomprehensible screaming , not all the time at least,  he'll scream about how the world is unfair,  games shouldn't be released unfinished or glitchey or broken, games just want to make him look bad and make him feel bad about himself , it's the game breaking or people cheating or the game deliberately making him lose , society is all about money and society just wants to make you feel bad ... things like that .

I've used to suggest putting the game down, walking away , it's just a game,  maybe stop playing... but he gets furious , he says he shouldn't have to stop playing , he should be able to do this , games were never this hard when he was a kid, society just made them hard to make more money. I shouldn't tell him what to do or how to feel.

I don't speak when he plays anymore  , if I speak it makes it worse , but sometimes me staying silent and still on the couch across the room from him makes it worse too, it's never consistent.  
If I leave the room when he's shouting it gets worse so it's easier to just stay there .

He says I shouldn't leave the room, that I'm abandoning him , that I just want to leave him if I can't handle him playing a video game , that he's allowed to feel his feelings and me walking away or staying silent and cowering is me denying him his feelings and making him feel bad .

So I just sit there and imagine I'm somewhere else or on the bad days I tell him I'm sick and stay in bed the whole day to avoid the living room where he plays ( our apartment is tiny and 3 rooms) at least I can sleep whilst he plays . He'll rage even when I stay in bed , just not as bad .

Other than the gamer rage he's an okay partner, I just don't feel like gamer rage qualifies as actual abuse? But I don't know anymore ...I don't know why he does it or why he doesn't just stop playing games if they upset him so much ... a Tv drama got too intense for me so I stopped watching it , ill only watch the nice episodes if I really really want to watch it again ( call the midwife) I don't understand why he can't do that as well?

I don't know...

It's weird because I didn't want to go there since he got knives in the house but he's talked about it for two days and I'm never going there again. He never has attempted to or mentioned it. Today and yesterday he said the only thing that felt good was strangling me and it felt so good, he wants to stab me in my ""gut"" (I'm thin and have a flat stomach he has the gut lol) with his box cutter, slit my throat, he doesn't like having sex with me it's just hurting me, and instead of jerking or to pics of me it's just thoughts of hurting or killing me. He's maybe said that once in passing but suddenly in the last fight we had for the past two days has repeatedly said it.",2025-01-19 23:06:41,2025-03-17 16:37:45,strangle

I will always hate him for what he put me through. 

I will never forget begging him to stop saying he hates me, curling up in a ball while he yells at me for hours on end, sitting on the floor crying after he finished attacking me, feeling emotionally numb as I just waited for him to stop strangling me, feeling immense guilt anytime I tried fighting back, having my self esteem destroyed and blaming myself for the insecurities he gave me, loving him with all my heart even as he was telling me all the reasons he hated me. 

Now he's moved on to someone new while I'm left behind to build myself back up. He's told her how crazy I acted after the breakup, that's who I am now in their world, the crazy ex. I never won. ",2024-11-22 07:20:52,2025-03-17 16:37:47,strangle

After 6 hours of this exhaustion i caved in and said ok we will try and he will control his anger etc. I was tired and he still wanted to have sex. I said no at first and then could not say no as I was scared it will again cause a fight. 

I felt abused, violated, hurt, heartbroken,sick to my stomach to see a man I loved become ruthless, callous, remorseless.

Next day acting like everything is normal, not giving me the needed comfort, care love  and I still kept waiting for it, craving it. I feel so confused. 

Why do I want his care affection when he abused me in the first place? 
Why can't I just ghost or ignore him like he does to me? 
Why do I feel the need to explain to him that I need care, comforting, love so he does that to make things right?

I hate that I feel this way, I’ve experienced the first part, but never actually beaten up. He has charged me and raised his fist at me too but never actually punched me. So I feel like I could’ve had it worse. And reading people’s stories of being strangled or beaten makes me feel like it’s not so bad. 

Actually, this just came to mind, many years before the abuse started to happen frequently we got into a really bad fight. He called me a c*nt and pushed me off the bed, I told him to go *off* himself as I left the room (I know that’s horrible and I’ve never said anything like that again) he came after me and socked me in the arm. It left a huge bruise. Other than that he hasn’t hit me. I guess I don’t include it because I said something really unforgivable ",2025-01-22 03:42:23,2025-03-17 16:37:49,strangle

1ivxd9w,I survived,PermissionGreen9798,9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ivxd9w/i_survived/,"I survived..

I remember when I met him, he was the perfect boyfriend ever, he got me gifts and flowers and give me so much attention and love, I thought he's the one and I'm gonna marry him in future. Later in relationship, one night we were drinking with our friends from work and watching football and I took his phone to take a photo and then accidentally  discovered he was texting to his ex girlfriend, I read messages while I was sitting next to him, he was telling her how much he misses her, that he wants to get back together with her, that she's the only girl he ever loved and stuff like that. I got so angry and confronted him about it right away and he just said we will talk later. I said okay but I couldn't act like nothing is going on and I distanced myself from him right away meanwhile he was acting like nothing happened, he was hugging me, holding my hand, tried to kiss me couple times while I was refusing and trying constantly to move away from him. Then he got up and said let's go to my room to talk so I went with him. And that was the night I should've left him for good and stopped everything with him. In the room he was trying to manipulate me saying ""That's just the way I was trying to leave her, I couldn't leave her just over night, you don't understand we were together for couple of years ... "" and that made me even more angry because he said he's single and that they broke up long ago and he told me that they did brake up long ago but they still had contact and some kind of weird relationship between them and that's the way he was trying to put an end on it. I didn't believe any of things he said, I was still very angry with him, I wanted to leave him and to go home. That's when he started to get little aggressive and saying that I annoy him with my behavior and that he doesn't fear anybody except Allah (he's muslim) and that his God will protect him and take care of him despite whatever he did in life, he's not scared of police or anything except his God. I was terrified with that things he said because he said it like he's going to do something to me and I got scared really quick and wanted even more to go home and so I started telling him everything is okay and I'm just tired and I wanna go home because I'm working tomorrow. That's when he punched the table in front of me and told me to stop acting like I was scared of him and like he's going to hurt me or whatever and I thought to myself..well he had couple of drinks, he's hurt and probably don't wanna lose me, he's a good guy that's just alcohol, I can help him, I think he loves me and stuff.. So I calmed him down little by little, I told him that I know he won't hurt me ever because I know he loves me and he really calmed down and sat next to me and we hugged some time and kissed, and when everything cooled off I went home. After that he really broke off everything with his ex, told her that he met me and that he loves me (He showed me messages) and everything went back to normal. He was again that perfect guy and I fell in love even more. We had beautiful relationship, we took care of each other, supported each other and we were very much in love and almost always together. We also worked at the same place, except I had day shift cause I was waitress and he was working nights cause he was in bakery. He lived in rooms next to our workplace and everytime I slept at his place he was checking up on me every chance he had and it was pretty nice. He would come on break in the middle of the night and cover me while I was sleeping with blanket, If I woke up he would ask me if I was hungry or thirsty or do I need anything. He was perfect. After couple of months something changed in him, it's like he started drinking,  acting possessive, wanted me to he with him 24/7, he wouldn't let me go home change my stuff or take some other clothes to wear, he would just wash it there and say "" I washed your clothes here they are clean you can wear them, no need to go home "" and I was like well I wanna wear something else, I don't wanna be always in the same clothes, and he always responded something like "" i don't care what you wear I love you the way you are, that doesn't matter to me "" . And he knew exactly how to melt my heart ( manipulate me ) so I didn't see how crazy all of that was, I was working at a place where he was constantly there checking up on me and then after work spend time with him and sleep at his place. After a week or two I really was little tired and wanted to have some me time so I can do skin care or something else, I just wanted to be little alone and at my home and I left, and every time I left he was acting like he misses me, he was texting me like he was depressed because I'm not there and I was like babe chill I just went home it's perfectly normal like we're gonna see each other tomorrow. But he kept saying stuff like that and somehow manipulated me to go back to his place or he will come to mine. I still loved me but It became too much for me to be constantly with him, I was feeling like I was trapped or in a cage cause I couldn't go anywhere or do anything. And as I started to go more home and distanced myself from him, he then started to put pressure on me that he wants us to get married, have kids start a family move in together and stuff, and I always said it's too early cause I was like 21 and he was 25 at the time, we were so young for that, I wasn't ready to start married life and have family. After a while he started drinking, like every day, he stopped sleeping, was always with his friend at bars drinking. I was always there for him cause I knew he has rough time, I just didn't know why and I just was there for him and waited for him to open up so I can help him, I didn't wanted to put any pressure on him. As the time went by, he was changing his behavior more and more and was drunk every day, he would get up and instead of breakfast he would just open a bottle of beer and started day with that and then continue till evening to drink. He was at the time still putting pressure on me, still was acting possessive and got jealous over nothing, he was paranoid and stuff, I didn't wanted to argue cause he was drunk all the time and I didn't wanted to make him mad cause I was scared of him. I was planning to slowly distance myself from him and eventually I would end the relationship. I wasn't feeling it anymore and person I fall for wasn't there anymore,  he was totally different and I didn't know who that person was and I just wanted to leave mostly because he was drinking too much. And I think he also knew that, he knew deep down. One day, our mutual friend was leaving the country and we wanted to meet all together and have couple of drinks and say goodbye. I was home getting ready and texting him all the time and just by vibes on texts it seemed like something was off. I called him and we spoke, and I asked him was he drinking today and he swore that he wasn't and that he had just like 1 beer, but I could tell he was drunk but decided to still meet with him cause I wanted to say goodbye to my friend and have some drinks myself. We meet later in a bar near our workplace and since he came I noticed he was waisted, I whispered to him and asked why he lied to me and he said he didn't and that he wasn't drunk at all, but he could barely talk normally. I was still little mad but I decided I'm not going to let him ruin my mood and was chilling. There were parents and two children from our mutual friend and that friend also and we were hanging and talking, and it was fun. At one point of the evening my boyfriend gave some money to the kids and started saying to me "" give them something, don't be like that, they are just little kids, how can you be like that "" and I was confused because I first off didn't do anything and I really didn't had money on me, I was always paying everything with card. And he knew that very well. Then he started putting money in my pockets and saying to me out loud like "" here you go, I'm gonna give you money since you don't have, just give it to the kids its nice thing to do "" and he kept saying that in way like I had something against the kids and I was very confused and asked him what is his problem, I told him I don't have anything against the kids and asked him to stop making me look bad in front of others. Then he started saying to me that I stop with my behavior, that I always ruin everything, he was asking me to be normal just this night and not to make drama or something, and that made me so mad cause I could tell he was ghosting me into thinking I'm the problem and like it's my fault and It never was. So I got up and said I'm gonna go home and then he pulled me from the table and told me to go, he threw my bag in front of me and shouted at me to leave, that I was this and this, so I picked my bag and I left. And guess what, he left right away with me, behind the bar he started yelling at me and I had enough at that point I was just like ""okay you're right, I'm just gonna go home we're over"". And then he hit me, he slapped me so hard and I remember at the moment that I couldn't believe that just happened, I remember just looking at him and  being completely shocked. I wanted to leave immediately but he started pulling me for my hair and hands and slapping me even more, and I was definitely making noise with every slap I got, but nobody did anything, nobody came to stop him. He started dragging me back to his place and I remember all the time he was telling me "" I'm gonna kill you when we get home. This is the last time you did this to me. I'm gonna kill you now I swear to Allah I am not afraid of anything I'm gonna kill you when we come home, you're dead "" and that scared me so much I sarted to pull and try to escape so badly but he kept hitting me and was stronger and bigger then me so I couldn't escpae. There were also some people passing on the street and only one them said something like ' leave the girl alone ' and he responded ' she's mine. I can do whatever I want with her' and that's it, nobody did anything,  everyone was just passing and looking like it was nothing going on while he was threatening me and hitting me on the street while I was trying to escape from him. We were close to his place and I knew that if I go up to that room I'm going to die, and I knew that I have to escape no matter what cause I don't wanna die, I kept thinking don't give up, if you go up there you're going to die, nobody can help you. When we came near the workplace, right in front of the stairs that led upstairs to his place I started pulling even more, I gathered every peace of strength I had and pulled away, he threw me on the ground and started strangling me right there on spot.. I remember it like it was yesterday.. I couldn't breathe, I felt so scared, like never before, I looked right at his eyes while he was strangling me and I didn't see anything, his eyes were empty, it looked like there was nobody behind them, like there's no person behind those eyes, pure emptiness. That scared me much more and while I was trying to defend myself and pulling his hands from my neck I kicked the pile of of boxes with empty bottles of drinks we served at restaurant and that made a huge noise. People from the garden ( the guests ) started looking around to see what happened and he saw that they are going to see him strangling me and as soon as felt he was distracted I pushed him and started yelling "" help he's trying to kill me! "" 
I couldn't yell loud cause I was trying at the same time to catch a breath but somehow I gathered strength to yell even louder every time cause I knew that was my only chance to escape this man. So the people heard me and came right away and I ran to them and started crying and shaking and I remember he was saying to them I was overreacting, that I was his girl and that I was drunk and he's just trying to get me home to bed and I was right away started yelling that he's lying and that he tried to kill me. People believed me cause I was covered in bruises, my hair was messy and half plucked. My coworker's at the time got me inside of restaurant and tried to calm me down and help me, they called the police and boss cause it happened inside of his property and I was just there.. Shaking, crying, I couldn't believe that actually happened, I couldn't believe that I could die, it all seemed like a horror movie.. They were all there asking me what happened, am I okay and I couldn't talk properly, I just fell into shock. After some time, police came and took me to hospital and I told them what happened. Later I found out he escaped right away from there and that police couldn't find him. My brother picked me up from hospital and took me home and stayed with me to watch for me in case he comes to my home and tries to hurt me. I was scared for my life. I kept thinking he's going to come back to finsih what he started, he's even more angrier now, he's going to find me and kill me. Day after I found out police arrested him, I also found out he got fired and left that place where he lived and went back to his country. Before that I heard from him once and saw him outside, he was sleeping on the street and benches and I offered him to come to my place to take a shower cause he was so dirty and looking really bad and I felt bad so I did the most stupid thing ever, and I did took him to my home but I first made a call to my roommates and neighborsso they know and can protect me if he tries anything. I washed his clothes, let him wash himself and warmed him enough and let him go, and I told him then this is the last time he sees me, and that I can't forgive or forget what he did to me, he apologized to me and told me he love me but I just couldn't forgive him for that so I escorted him out from my house and never saw him again after that. I also didn't press any charges, only the state sentenced him and deported him back to his country. And that's the end, after some time I got back on my job and started living normal life. But to this day I remember everything, every word, every emotion absolutely everything from that day... today is two years after that happened and I'm still single, I think about that very often, and sometimes I can't believe that actually happened, it's like unreal. But I know it did, and I survived. I fucking survived. And I'm gonna keep on living because I deserve it. I look back and now I know I should've break up long before all that, but who can blame me? I was in love and manipulated. But I survived, I don't know if I will ever date again, or trust a man for that matter, but I will keep living and telling people my story. And I hope that nobody experience this, not one woman should experience this, I pray for all women across the world to be safe and take care and protect themselves from man like this. 🙏✝️",2025-02-23 00:26:30,2025-03-17 16:37:53,strangle

The first one involved physical violence, my partner would strangle me and injure me when we argued. He also sexually abused me and made sexual contact with me against my will. 

The next one was very emotionally abusive, very religious, he would always make me feel “less than” him because he was “holier” than me and it was his job to “guide me” into being holier. He was a youth chastity minister, and yet cheated on me multiple times in our relationship and then said I was “controlling” because I expressed issue with him cheating on me with multiple women. 

But now I’m with my current partner. I don’t know if he really has my best interest at heart sometimes. I don’t know if he is just “imperfect” because he is human or if I am really with another abuser. 

Whenever I bring problems to him or ask for his help, he normally doesn’t help me the first few times. He’ll act like the conversation didn’t happen. Or sometimes he will laugh and say that I don’t really need that kind of help or support. Then when I ask for his help again, he gets angry and tells me why I shouldn’t be asking for the specific thing or kind of help I’m asking for. And implies that I’m in the wrong or mean or lazy or demanding for asking him. He is very scary when he gets this level of mad. He slams things. Slams his fists on the counter. Slams doors, yells very loud and erratically. He’ll get very close to me when he gets angry and it scares and overwhelms me. Then I suffer in silence for a time. Try to do everything myself and shame myself for asking him to begin with. Then it becomes too much to carry eventually and I blow a gasket and I start getting distant from him and angry. And as soon as I start emotionally distancing myself from him, he all of a sudden wants to do all the things I asked me to help me with months ago. And then I get angrier and say “why are you doing these things now that I’m halfway out the door?” Why don’t you do things the first time I ask you for help?” And then he says that I am unpredictable, mean, explosive, impatient, and demanding him to be perfect. He then insists that he loves me and then buys me all these lavish big gifts that I never asked for. 80% of the time these conversations revolve around me asking him help with housework, chores, and making my doctor’s appointments. 

Besides this, I wouldn’t say he is “abusive” he has done good things for me too here and there. He financially supported me when I had become homeless for a short time (thru no fault of my own) in the past. 

But sometimes I feel like he expects me to do everything for him and baby him and get the bare minimum in return. And I’m expected to be perfectly happy about it. 

And then the cycle continues every single time like this.

1ht6yjx,I realized I'm the problem,areyoume401,13,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ht6yjx/i_realized_im_the_problem/,"I wrote about my experience with DV in another post. I thought I was the victim until the other night.

My ex and I decided to start seeing each other again and things were going well. We decided to stop drinking together unless it's a cocktail or two every now and then. We went out after Christmas and ran into an acquaintance who bought himself and I shots (my SO turned down said shot- I was not within earshot of the convo prior to the drink ordering). I felt obliged to take the shot and ngl, was also just feeling fun and fresh and thought one shot couldn't hurt. I took the shot and then found out the contents were the equivalent of a shot of absinthe???

My ex and I were fine. That was the only shot I'd had besides beer each. We were invited to a Xmas party with his closest friends who I was very excited to see because I haven't hung out with them since we broke up a year ago. I remember everything being cool. I was having fun and then \*bam\* I remember nothing. Next thing I know, I'm in a parking lot on the phone with my brother. Flash forward, I'm in my ex's bedroom throwing a shoe at him and he's recording me and asking me to leave.

The next morning, I woke up in his bed and he said I needed to get dressed and leave. I told him I have no idea what happened. He explained that I lost all the light in my eyes and made all of his friends at the party uncomfortable by asking them how many people he's had sex with, telling them to fuck off when they comforted me, and then ultimately throwing punches at him and screaming bloody murder when he tried to get me home that ""I want to hang out with his friends"". When he drove me home, apparently I tried jumping out of the car several times. He said he had to grab me by the hair and pull me to the passenger seat to stop me from jumping out of the car.

The next day I couldn't move my head. My neck is still kinked 3 days later. I have bruises all over my body including a sprained wrist and my hair fell out in chunks in the shower. My mother asked me on Christmas why I have a handprint bruise on my arm and I laughed it off because I just feel now like I deserve everything that happens to me. I've woken up every day feeling like a piece of shit who doesn't deserve to be alive. The only thing keeping me here is my the fact that I know how much my family loves me.

I made the choice to hang out with him, I took the shot, I threw punches, I made people uncomfortable. And when I think back to my last incident, I threw the first punch too and then he retaliated by strangling me. I don't know what to believe about myself or about this situation.

I don't know if I'm seeking help here or for someone to tell me yes, I deserve this.",2025-01-04 05:02:05,2025-03-17 16:38:00,strangle
1ix4zuo,Can't take any more,Existing-Jello8744,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ix4zuo/cant_take_any_more/,"Sorry this is going to be a very long one. Never posted on this site before I am just a reader. But I am at my wits end. I suffered domestic abuse for 15 years, threats to my family, friends if I left. (It got to the point the threats to my own life didn't matter anymore - I would have welcomed death as a way out) I was absolutely trapped, terrified and isolated. I have a child with this man, luckily the most amazing mature kid I could only have wished for, who I protected from seeing as much as I could. I begged for help from police, I knew I was in more danger leaving than when I was putting up with the abuse. Not just me at risk, but everyone I love.

 This man did the most cruel things to me through our relationship. Made me dig my own grave, strangled and beat me more times than I could count, attempted to stab me, shaved my hair off, broke my bones, beat me into losing a baby, made me quit my job, stop seeing friends, stop seeing family, was racist and violent toward my family, things I couldn't even imagine putting someone through. It was daily torture. His poor mother even took her own life as a result of his abuse and the constant mental torment of his actions to everyone else. 

 I managed to leave 6 years ago with the help and support of police, social workers, to sadly end up still living in a cycle of abuse and isolation, due to his threats. It should have been my time to heal but instead I felt more trapped than ever. I got restraining orders, he broke them, I had to have my letterbox sealed as he threatened to burn my house down and had to have alarms fit incase he came to attack me. I had no way of moving out of our hometown, I got constantly harrassed and abused to the point I tried to take my own life as my only way out.

Fast forward to 3 years ago and the abuse and threats were there but more infrequent as he would get arrested every time contact was made, (a slap on the wrist and let out again). Each time he ""slipped through the net"". I wasn't allowed to move house, wasn't allowed to move on in a relationship, he told our child he would never accept me being with anyone else and that was ""the choice I made having a kid with him"" - it meant I had to either be ""a family"" with threats, mental and physical abuse, or be on my own forever. Then he made some awful threats to her about me, said some awful things, which resulted in him being stopped contact as the social workers agreed that it was very detrimental and she was a pawn in his abuse. I spent every day looking over my shoulder, scared to even walk down the street incase he saw me and ran me over, scared to do anything that involved leading a normal life. 

I started a long road of healing myself with no idea where to start, I was consumed with fear but also a determination that I was ALMOST there, I was almost free of his clutches, every time he was arrested it was closer to him going to jail, every time he left me alone for a couple of months I regained a bit more strength and self love. I got my friends back, I got my life back, I even went on holiday with my old school friend, something I never thought I'd get a chance to do. I was becoming stronger, and more free by the day.

Then, I met a guy. 

Someone I never expected or planned to fall for, but god, I did. I consumed myself with love and happiness and found myself again, found someone I instantly and truly felt like I could love, trust, and let my walls down that were so high. The threats were still here and there but 6 years after a breakup? Who shouldn't move on after that amount of time? 

So I did. And I was happy. For the first time I saw my future with love and happiness, not fear and threats.

Then.. not even year into our relationship, my ex attacked him. Viciously and callously with no remorse or regard for life. He stabbed him, multiple times, all over his body, in his face, and made sure I heard and saw everything he had done. Luckily through numerous operations he survived, healed well, despite lasting scars and trauma. 

Now my life is upside down. My child's father is in jail, where he belongs, but a good man was hurt in the process. He is traumatised, I am traumatised, we wanted to be together, despite all this, we wanted to make it work, but now after everything, we can't fathom our way through our mental struggles that this has caused. I totally understand why he would struggle to be with me now, who wouldn't? But we convinced ourselves we could get through it, and we did the hard bit, but now, almost a year later, we have both reached a point we can't continue with the arguments and stress that we both bring to eachother with our own mental health. He has been unfaithful since, which I forgave him for multiple times as I know how his life has been turned upside down, and I tried to understand his low points,  but it has brought added stress and arguments. I have done everything possible to stand by him, help him, support him, I have foregone my own mental health to focus on his, I have never made it about me and my abuse, I didnt want to dismiss what he has been through. I just think that even I am now a lasting reminder of nearly losing his life, despite his love for me, it can't replace the trauma and I don't blame him, I'm struggling too so I can only imagine what he went through that day, and since. It's just hard because we really do love eachother, we laugh like best friends when times are good, but now things are more bad than good and it's reached a point of no return, despite both of us really wanting it to work. He has therapy once every 2 weeks but feels as though it makes him worse, dragging the memories back up that he is trying to bury. I know that no amount of burying emotions works and you have to work through them. But the more I push for this the more he would push away. He isn't a ""talk to strangers"" kind of guy despite how much I think talking helps. 

I don't know what I expect by writing this, but I needed to rant, write, whatever I could do to actually fathom how my life has ended up like this. Everyone struggles and everyone has their own life, but I really do wonder when mine will give me a break. There has been investigations within the police to see why this was even able to get to this point, I have had apologies, I have had excuses, but nothing matters now, it's all too late. 

I wrote su*cide letters to my family incase I can't hang on much longer, and I know people's first thought is selfish - her child has already lost her dad. But this is anything but. When he comes out of jail for what he has done, not even a handful of years, he will only repeat the abuse and I can not risk anyone else hurt, because of a relationship I got trapped into from 17 years old. It has already taken my life until now, I can't help but think maybe if I weren't here anymore, he would finally feel satisfied and atleast my loved ones could live free, and happy. My parents are amazing, they love my daughter like their own, she is probably bonded more with them as the years I spent trapped they helped raise her as to protect her from the abuse.

 Please don't think I am selfish, I am just lost. ",2025-02-24 15:42:59,2025-03-17 16:38:01,strangle
1hw4rm8,What is IPV Strangulation?,Longjumping_Talk_123,5,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hw4rm8/what_is_ipv_strangulation/,"I apologize if this is a dumb question or has already been answered.

I guess I am wondering what constitutes ""strangulation"" that increases the risk of Domestic Homicide. I understand you do not have to lose consciousness, it does not have to be just by hands, and it does not have to be fatal. However, when I hear that the risk of Domestic Homicide is seven times more likely when your partner strangles you, I get a bit confused (or maybe in denial?).

Does it include sexual strangulation? Or, I guess, ""affectionate strangulation?"" (I get the feeling this involves consent- nobody consents to violent, painful strangulation I understand. I mean more so like consenting to choking as a kink).

I struggle with this because my ex partner and I had talked about choking as an intimate practice. I said I was okay with it, he said he was very skilled in it (he was very sex positive and knowledgeable about sex and kink, I was not. He was recovering from sex addiction and working with a sex-informed therapist). He never once choked me in bed, but he did choke me in public once that really stuck out to me. He took me to a dead aisle in a supermarket, looked around, grabbed the front of my neck so tightly it stung and pulled me in for a kiss (this is the ""affectionate strangulation"" he talked about). His teeth were gritted and it was a shock for me (and kind of embarrassing, like we should not be doing this in a grocery store). I don't feel like this counts as strangulation to be worried about because maybe he just thought he was being kinky and we had agreed to choking in the bedroom. I am very confused about it.

Some further context as to why he might have only meant it as a fun ""public"" kink (we never agreed on doing things in public, except for in the woods, but maybe he got confused): He would also make me grab things off the bottom shelf or would drop things and make me pick them up in public, and then he would look around and thrust into my backside (which I also found embarrassing). He would force me to smack his ass in public (I would say no (especially if there were kids around), he would repeatedly say ""do it, do it, do it"" with increasing pressure until I did he would withhold affection). Lastly, he would ask to do compromising intimate acts with me, like he wanted to ""put it in"" under the blanket while his mom was talking to us, he wanted me to take off my top when I would drop him off outside his front door (after ignoring me the entire car ride), he tried to finger me in front of his dog, and I once gave him head while another couple was having a really heated argument to take his mind off it so he wouldn't be stressed and think less of me for bringing him around stress.

TLDR; I feel like maybe he wasn't as violent or scary as I made him out to be and maybe I am just bitter because he discarded me and it was short-term (I sometimes struggle believing abuse could escalate like that over such a short period). I also struggle to know what is dangerous strangulation and what is just ""kinky"" strangulation- what constitutes the strangulation that increases your risk of DH and what is ""harmless"" or ""playful"" strangulation my ex talked about?",2025-01-07 23:02:15,2025-03-17 16:38:02,strangle
1hsw7ul,started a short story about my life. is it worth continuing or a waste of time? be honest,JadenMavia,7,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1hsw7ul/started_a_short_story_about_my_life_is_it_worth/,"Prologue



“He tried to choke me” is an incorrect statement. Choking is when someone can’t breathe because something is INSIDE their throat. The correct statement is “he was strangling me”. Strangling is when someone squeezes the OUTSIDE of the throat. Important distinction. Crazy how many people aren’t aware of it.



This is the story about he who shall not be named (Harry Potter reference from a 33 year old of course) and how his story became my story. 



He had a bad childhood, the abusive father, the toxic home, the jumping from shelter to shelter type. By the time I met him, he had a stable career, and seemed to have made the most from the bad hand he was dealt. You’d think a past like that would make someone that much more careful to turn things around. You’d think…well, I thought. Instead, it was the classic case of the abused becoming the abuser.



Once someone is abused, their brain physically changes. Not just the way they think, but their actual brain. I think I was aware of when mine was changing. When I started dissociating and forgetting what I did the day before. When I blocked out entire days and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t remember them. When I’d write lists when shopping, otherwise I’d forget what I needed. Or the worst was when I’d forget an ingredient or a crucial step when cooking. I used to love cooking.



Abuse was an unknown concept for me, I was blessed with a beautiful childhood. I have my husband to thank for showing me how dark the world can really be. I’m getting ahead of myself, let me start from the beginning.

1io9oos,I got out but so did he. I don’t know what to do,iseekaprophet,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1io9oos/i_got_out_but_so_did_he_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"Alt account disclaimer, some details changed for safety. 

It has been about 6 months since successfully getting out. I didn’t think I could do it and I did. It all came to a head one day. He ran at me and punched me hard in the back while I was getting ready for work and it hurt. After years of abuse of all kinds, much more severe than this, I wonder why a random unprompted punch was enough to make up my mind. 

While I was at work I texted my dad, “You need to get me out of here.” Long story short, I was with my lawyer and the police until 2am that night. He harassed me with phone calls, feigned confusion and innocence, switched between rage and being “hurt”. I cried the entire time about how I knew he would feel so betrayed and confused but I did it anyway. They took photos of my back with bruises, screenshots of his abusive and threatening texts (including ones admitting he had strangled me before), photos of other injuries. He was in and out of court and police custody. He wanted me to return his illegal firearm to him. I reported that to the police as well. I did everything I could to build the case. The police had prior record of domestic dispute calls by neighbors to our address. I had so many photos. At the hearing for the restraining order, his only question was, “When does it expire?” 

I did not go to his criminal hearing, but submitted a statement recommending against the offender program. He’d already been in therapy for years and I knew he’d find a way to manipulate everyone and learn nothing. My lawyer helped me recommend jail time to him hoping it’d teach him a lesson or at least keep him physically away. I was enjoying my life without him. 

I found out several weeks ago that the court assigned him the program, no jail time. And since then I have been immediately spiraling. How do I ever feel safe again? He’s a narcissistic, malignant genius. He’ll weasel his way out of everything and will learn nothing. I don’t feel safe anymore and I don’t know what to do. He is so vindictive and he always was so adamant about not being taken to court. I feel like he is counting down the days until he can come and fucking get me and I don’t know what to do.  I feel like I will never feel safe again and honestly am wondering if all i did was even worth it. I’m sorry this is so rambly. I just needed to get it out. My therapist left the state months ago and I just haven’t been able to get established with someone else since. I just feel so alone and terrified and desperately wish I had never let it get to this point ",2025-02-13 03:14:02,2025-03-17 16:38:05,strangle
