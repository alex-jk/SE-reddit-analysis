1jajams,Abused wants to tell the abuser that she‚Äôs leaving,MyMonkeyCircus,19,84,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1jajams/abused_wants_to_tell_the_abuser_that_shes_leaving/,"UPDATE. SHE LEFT and is in a hotel until she can connect with local resources. She is a mess, but we‚Äôll take it one step at a time.

She left a day earlier because his weekend shift got cancelled and she realized he will likely ‚Äúcelebrate‚Äù that extra free day with a drink.

Your comments and stories helped a lot. After discussing them over the phone, she realized that she cannot afford to spend one more weekend with him, because it will very likely become her last weekend.

She did not tell him anything and didn‚Äôt leave the letter. She, unfortunately, decided to take his call, and he went from ‚Äúlove of my life, where are you, I am worried sick‚Äù to a ‚Äúyou dirty bitch, you used me‚Äù real quick. She blocked him after the call. I do not think he can track her - he isn‚Äôt exactly technical, their phones have different operating systems, and she disabled l location services. 

Thank you all very much.

Disclaimer: I am writing about a situation of my relative because her reddit is being actively monitored by her abuser. I will be able to call her to share comments. 

I do not know all the details and their history of the abuse, I only know that ‚Äúit was not that bad before‚Äù and that it has rapidly escalated about a month ago - that‚Äôs when she reached out to me for help. He hit and strangled her several times, there are photos of bruises on her neck and recordings of conversation that lead to one of the attacks.

She is ready to leave this weekend while he is at work. She has most basics packed, some cash stashed, and a temporary housing arranged in a different city. She, however, feels uneasy about leaving unannounced. She wants to somehow let him know that she left. She is convinced that it isn‚Äôt a big deal because the abuser is only physically violent when he is drunk. She says she only expects him to be verbally aggressive.

I think it is a bad idea because what if her farewell causes things to escalate even more? He is a very strong man and she is a physically sick weak woman. There is absolutely no way she can fight back if he attacks her again. I believe she is not dead only because he let her live.

I need some tips/advice please.",2025-03-13 18:40:30,2025-03-17 03:01:03,abuse

1j6fl1n,I know my relationship is abusive & I can‚Äôt leave,Illustrious_Elk_7292,20,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j6fl1n/i_know_my_relationship_is_abusive_i_cant_leave/,"
(Warning long post sorry)

I am 22, my boyfriend is 28, I am 34 weeks pregnant with his child and we have been together for only a year. I‚Äôve never had feelings so strongly for someone so quick, to me he was the biggest sweetheart I‚Äôve ever met but I could tell from the get go there were a few red flags.

Our relationship sort of consisted of going out, drinking and doing drugs before I got pregnant, he‚Äôs also got another child he can‚Äôt see for unknown reasons. He tried pressuring me to get an abortion but I felt so much love for the baby and it just changed something in me instantly so I didn‚Äôt go ahead, it didn‚Äôt matter to me whether he was there or not because I knew I could handle it on my own.

In the last few months, our relationship has completely deteriorated. Whenever he drinks, he all of a sudden hates me and wants to hurt me.

The first time it happened (probs around 16 weeks into my pregnancy), we were at a pub with my parents, we went home as normal and then something switched in him. He started saying really hurtful things sending me into a panic attack and getting aggressive for not letting him drive drunk, he ended up driving very erratically and I was scared for my life and vomited on myself which he called me disgusting for, and grabbed my arm so hard and twisted it, then threatened to break my arm because I wanted to jump out of the car. When we got home he threatened to break my laptop and pushed me over. 

I have had 4 other situations similar to this, which he denies ever happened.

The fact that he doesn‚Äôt admit it, has made me insane to the point I can‚Äôt leave him alone because I just want some kind of closure. I feel absolutely crazy and selfish for risking the babies health because I can‚Äôt manage my emotions and leave the relationship. I love her so much and I get so angry with myself when I let him do this again, I don‚Äôt know why I trust that he won‚Äôt. I hate myself.

I love him when he‚Äôs sober, I can‚Äôt bare the fact he is like this now and I hate him so much but I still hold on to that version of him that once made me so happy but I know he‚Äôs gone.

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. How do you move on without getting the closure you want so bad and accepting that person you once loved is gone? My family physically abused me and did this to me growing up also which is really triggering üòï",2025-03-08 11:53:25,2025-03-17 03:01:10,abuse
1iahvds,Did your abuser pay for dinner on the first date?,bengalbear24,18,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iahvds/did_your_abuser_pay_for_dinner_on_the_first_date/,"I‚Äôm trying to study all the red flags so I can know what to avoid next time and ideally cut it off early, after the first date. I‚Äôm trying to understand if there‚Äôs any correlation between abuse and whether they pay for the first date. Both of my emotionally abusive ex‚Äôs agreed to split the bill on the first date when I offered when the check came, with no pushback or insistence that they pay (despite asking me out). At the time I didn‚Äôt see it as a red flag because I was into feminism and equality, and I thought that meant that I should pay for my own meal. I never expected a man to pay for me on a date, but now I‚Äôm wondering if that was an early sign of disrespect.

I know there are arguments on both sides of this, and that many abusers probably have offered or insisted to pay. A lot of them can appear charming and chivalrous early on, intensely pursue, or love-bomb you. I‚Äôm not sure how I should feel about this and whether I should expect a man to pay for the first date, if I should offer to split the check or just let him treat me and thank him, and if I should see him asking or allowing me to pay as a red flag. Perhaps whether they pay for the first date isn‚Äôt even correlated with abuse, but I‚Äôm desperately trying to find patterns early on to avoid it next time.

1h6qw8r,Why do people defend abusers?,burneracct808,27,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1h6qw8r/why_do_people_defend_abusers/,"I understand this in a textbook and a psychology perspective sense, but I can never personally understand it? I‚Äôm thankfully out of my DV relationship. We‚Äôve had a kid together, so unfortunately this means we‚Äôre in the legal process right now. This process has shown me how much people will lie in the court of law and just lie in general to defend my abuser. It‚Äôs insane.

Most of them are victims themselves of other DV experiences, but this perpetuates the cycle. Most of them are family members of his, family members with kids. Why would you want to risk lying in court for an abuser? To risk your own family? What are they teaching their kids?

Others are people who are in an ongoing DV relationship and have to defend him because their abuser is friends with my abuser. I understand because they are not safe as they are still with their abuser, but if the roles were ever reversed I‚Äôd do what it takes to defend the victims for legal matters or any matters too and if I was still with my abuser I‚Äôd still be defending them, despite any repercussions that I‚Äôd receive. Some situations may be more extreme, of course, and simply cannot. But why defend my abuser? It‚Äôs okay if they don‚Äôt aid me or do anything that will harm them or their kids, I don‚Äôt need or want that to happen, but why defend him?? As if they don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs done to me and in the same situation themselves. Why act as if he‚Äôs the victim??

1ganvb9,Do you think abusers can change with therapy?,Stripawaymylove,34,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ganvb9/do_you_think_abusers_can_change_with_therapy/,"I escaped an abusive relationship that had spousal rape with emotional abuse and manipulation. It took me farrrrr longer to leave than I would have preferred but it ultimately came down to he was abusing our cats and he ultimately killed one of the kittens. I saw the light that day, that if he could do that to a kitten who knows what he could do to me. Also, I don‚Äôt think anyone who kills a kitten is redeemable. This was back in 2014/2015 when we were both 22/24. 

Everytime I see a post on Reddit where a woman is complaint of their male partner I IMMEDIATELY assume it‚Äôs him until I read on and it‚Äôs not. This sparks my curiosity to see what he‚Äôs up to and look him up. 

Well, I recently saw that he was engaged to a woman with a child and a pet. I immediately got scared for her life and ended up sending her a message letting her know about what happened and to be careful with this man. 

Thankfully she didn‚Äôt respond in anger but honestly as a ‚ÄúI know about all of this, he‚Äôs gotten therapy, and has been nothing but perfect to me.‚Äù 

I know I should just let them be but I also wonder if he‚Äôs really changed and gotten better? Do you think that‚Äôs possible? I think he‚Äôs become a better abuser as time has gone on and he‚Äôs hiding it for longer. I wanna see the best in others but I have my doubts and I‚Äôm still scared for her. I‚Äôm not gonna respond because nothing more I can do. I just hope that message will be there to validate her if he does change back to his abusive ways.

1i27h34,When did you realize you were being abused?,anonykitcat,20,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1i27h34/when_did_you_realize_you_were_being_abused/,"My realization happened slowly and gradually. He started behaving abusively about 4 months in, but I blamed myself and took just as much responsibility for the incident. Then he did again and again, every few weeks or so, until I started slowly realizing that it was a pattern. By the 1-year mark, I had fully realized (and told him) that he was emotionally and verbally abusing me. However, despite this realization, it had not sunk in that I was in an abusive relationship -- just that he was behaving abusively to me sometimes (when we were fighting). I didn't realize yet about the cycle of abuse, or the fact that abuse doesn't need to happen all the time or even most of the time for it to count as real abuse. I also didn't really think that verbal/emotional abuse were ""real"" abuse, and that since he hadn't hit me, it wasn't that bad.

About 3-4 years in, I became aware that it was a real problem and started to maybe consider I was in an abusive relationship. But still, a lot of denial, a lot of downplaying it, blaming myself for it, accepting his apologies, hoping it would get better. And still, I didn't think it was real abuse since he hadn't hit me.

Only now, after almost 5 years, do I fully realize that this is an abusive relationship and that I am stuck in a trauma-bond with him. It's taken me several books, calls to domestic violence centers, websites, therapists, a friend, a couple of family members, and hundreds of people on reddit to tell me that his behaviors are textbook abuse. Even after that, I have been in and out of a state of denial for the past year, thinking ""well his behaviors are abusive¬†*sometimes*, but it's not actually an abusive relationship"", or ""he has never hit me/hurt me, so it's not really¬†*real*¬†or seriously¬†*bad*¬†abuse"".

Part of the reason I haven't believed it is because he would constantly mock me/invalidate me/gaslight me about it. I tried to tell him so many times that he was being abusive to me, and he laughed at it saying I was acting like a victim which was pathetic, that I wanted to be a victim, that I was behaving dramatically as if I was covered head to toe in bruises or like he had beaten the shit out of me. So many people have tried to get this through my head, but I still believed him over everyone else. I feel ashamed for taking so long to realize this, for being in denial, and for being stuck in it for years.

So -- how long did it take you to realize it was abuse, and at what point did the denial stop?",2025-01-15 20:52:25,2025-03-17 03:01:20,abuse

Should I warn her? Or just leave it be to avoid drama? I worry for her safety, he was emotionally and verbally abusive quickly but has a charismatic personality that will pull you in. Very good at love bombing and making you feel special at first, then starts the gaslighting, anger issues, and controlling. 

He also has a baby daughter with an ex wife that he sees weekly, and I worry for their safety too. He is unstable. Should I try to contact anyone about what happened or just move on?

We are renting a house and our lease ends in October 2025. It is only my name on the lease as he has bad rental history and credit.

My boyfriend has been escalating in his physical abuse, ranging from strangulation to now punching in head, arm, legs, back, and ribs. I know I am in danger of serious harm. He has even made threats to kill me. I know it isn't right, and I am ready to leave.

I know it won't be easy, and I do not want the police involved, even though I feel like that is inevitable, I do not want the police involved because:

1. I do not want to press any criminal charges
2. He is on probation, and I do not want him to get locked him (most likely if I get a protection order).
3. He said if I call the police he will kill me

I have already told my family and friends my decision on leaving (not the abuse of course, otherwise I know my mother would literally kill him). They offered to help me with his half of the rent, moving expenses, etc to come home. However, a part of me feels this is too much to ask as it'll be a lot of money.

Are there any alternatives to a protection order? Right now, I don't have a plan. I just want him out, but I'm afraid he will break another window, or follow through with his threats if I change the locks.

Here's some more context:

\- I work about 40 minutes from my house with a hybrid schedule, Mostly remote. However, I just started about 2 months ago so I do not want to abuse that privilege too much too soon.

\- I live about 4 hours away from my ""home."" So if I go ""home,"" I'm not sure how this job will work out, and I really really like and want to keep this job.

\- We just moved into this house in October. The landlord said before we signed the lease that if we break it and move out, we must pay 85% of the total rent for the remaining months (roughly $9,350). Even though I know my landlord is very reasonable and an understanding guy, I don't know if I'm able to tell him what is going on within his home. Yes, it'll get me out of the lease relatively easily, it feels too much, I can't explain it. On the other hand, my boyfriend has already broke a window that has yet to be repaired.

I am scared to get a protection order because I am afraid it'll make him worse. As of right now, I don't know what to do first, or how to go about anything. Any advice is greatly appreciated. TYIA",2024-12-12 05:48:38,2025-03-17 03:01:33,abuse
1i2bbtf,Warning my abusers new wife,Rich-Yogurtcloset964,16,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1i2bbtf/warning_my_abusers_new_wife/,"Edit/Update:
Thank you to everyone who responded and shared your stories. I see I am not alone in this situation and that it is never easy for anyone. For now, I am going to take what most of you suggested to do and stay out of it, at least until my case is over. As much as I would love to prevent future harm, I don't think I can by warning her. I know my abuser is a dangerous and volatile person, which is why I have pressed charges twice. He is also incredibly manipulative, which is why I stayed with him for five years despite major red flags. I don't think I would have heard the warning in the early honeymoon stages and I doubt this person would either if she married him so quickly. What an awful world these people create for us. I'll leave this post up for anyone else who might be in a similar situation. Good luck to all, wherever you are on your path out.   

I'm in a moral quandary.
Ex was brutal and dangerous. I am the victim in a current criminal case against him, the second one, this time for aggravated assault. There is a restraining order in place. The relationship ended when he tried to end my life. I was preparing to leave when it happened. He was increasingly violent from about 6 months in. This happened almost 7 years ago. 

I just found out he's newly married. I feel the most powerful urge to warn her, but I worry it might hurt the case or put me in danger. I have looked up defamation laws in my area, it seems like I would be fine as long as my wording is careful and I stick to facts. I can reach her at her job, where she will most likely be alone. There's a high chance he will leave my country to avoid sentencing and take her with him to a place that has a terrible record for women's rights. My husband and I concluded that i have a moral duty to inform, but I worry I might be reacting as a traumatic response. Can anyone please advise? Have you done this as the survivor?

This time, it sounded like it was escalating. There was stomping and frantic sliding of feet. I went upstairs quickly and quietly, and opened the living room door without knocking (we all live in the the same two story unit).

I saw them standing, pressed hard against each other. His right arm was over her shoulder and around her neck. He had her in a head lock. I could only see the top of her head. 

It only lasted for a split second until they noticed me, and I immediately led by stating that there was way too much noise going on up here, and I pretended I didn't notice. I kept making it about the noise and my concern for him- I played the fool, and I think he bought it.

Oddly enough, I've studied abusive relationships in University. I think if I had confronted him then and there, not only would it change nothing, but it might even make it worse for her. 

I think I have a narrow window of advantage here, but I'm not sure what to do (despite studying the subject). Or at least, I'm not sure if my idea is the right one.

I need advice and help on this. Any input is deeply welcome and appreciated.

My idea, is to pretend I don't know, while my partner and her girl friends get closer to her without letting on. From what I've seen, social isolation is the enemy, and if I let on that I know they'll move out instantly and then I really can't help her.

--Update--
My partner and I talked a lot about everything, and we have a short-term plan. There's a few steps we're going to take:

0. When I have a private moment, I'll call the local DV hotline to get their opinion

1. Start documenting everything in a journal: times, descriptions, etc

2. Order a voice recorder off amazon and put it in the air vent between the floors. Hopefully we won't ever need it

3. During a time when he's not home, talk with her and say ""I'm going out to get some groceries, do you need anything? Because if you ever need anything, anything at all, all you have to do is let us know.""

4. Pretend like I saw nothing, that I simply was in the wrong, and that I'm embarrassed about how I got in the middle of their argument. Be freindly with him still

5. Start selling things I don't need and looking for a new apartment. This could take many months given where I live, but at least I can get ready and mobile so I can take cover my own back given the unstable living position

6. My partner's circle of girl friends will include her in their plans, build trust, and let her open up on her own time

7. I'll look for job postings for caf√©s or other places she could work and share them with her casually

8. I'll be prepared to call the police if I detect signs of violence. I'm much larger than the guy, so I think if I was just in the same room things would descalte while waiting for the police and I wouldn't need to get physical to protect her (not a problem if it is needed)

9. Do nothing else. I will not confront him unless I need to prevent physical violence. This is by far the hardest part.",2025-02-23 15:34:46,2025-03-17 03:01:36,abuse

He has always had signs of a temper and breaking things but I ignored it reminding myself how I used to throw and breaks things when I was younger. He was always accusing me of cheating, always wanted to know what I was doing, isolated me from my friends, telling me they were bad influences for me and kept me from my family more than I wanted to. In October after I went back to work postpartum, he quit his job to stay home with the twins. This is when things got bad. He would fight with me about every little thing, hated having the twins and reminded me how I ruined his life, he began putting his hands on me. He started off with throwing things at me like a box of used cat litter and hamper baskets to grabbing me behind the back of my neck and shoving me into the bed threatening to kill me. He escalated to grabbing me by my hair, throat and squeezing hard, picking me up and slamming me on the floor or bed, kicking me while I was on the floor, and punching me in the body. He started putting objects to my throat, scissors, screw drivers to my stomach, box cutter to throat and knife to my throat. He threatens to kill me when I tell him to leave and that there is nothing left. He says if we split then there's only one way out for me. He will kill me. He says he has nothing left to lose and if he goes down I am going down with him. He has threatened to slit my throat many times, he has given me concussions, bruises and a lot of heartbreak. I have loved this man from the beginning and supported him. Because of me he has a big new diesel truck in my name, gadgets that he could never afford, a new 5th wheel camper, and when he gets angry he damages expensive TV's, the truck, my cars and doesn't pay for the damages. I have to. He hasn't paid for one can of formula for the twins, clothes, or diapers. When I ask now that he is working again to buy this he conveniently forgets. But i cant express any anger, or frustration, because I don't want to get hit or threatened with a knife. He tells me if I call the police or get a restraining order that he will come back for me. He said he's patient, that he will kill me and my loved ones one by one, that's not a threat, it's a promise. I have two boys from a previous relationship and my twins. I am worried, I fear every day this will be the day we fight and he'll hurt me again, when we fight and he's beating me or putting a knife to my throat or holding my mouth and nose so I can't breath I fear this is the day I am going to die. My brain can't comprehend what's really going on, like I am in a numb state of shock. I know what is happening, but then again I don't. Like it's a horrible nightmare. My husband isn't really abusing me is he? I have no one to turn to. No one to talk to anymore. I am conflicted, lost, heartbroken. When he is in a good mood he's great, which confuses me all the more. This can't be the same man who tells me he hates me, that I am disgusting, that he is going to kill me, is it?

If I flinch, look frightened for a moment, or ask him why he's doing it, he will tell me that I'm too sensitive, paranoid, am no fun, and complain about how he can't even joke/play around with me without me massively overreacting. Sometimes he slaps/bites me a little harder than I like (not hard enough to leave bruises, but hard enough for me to say ""ow!"") and if I ask him to go gentler, he will complain that I'm way too sensitive and he can't even play around with me.

I took my dogs and left behind pretty much everything else I owned. I spent more than a week in hiding, afraid to go outside or even open the curtains. 

I have talked to my mom several times since I left, and almost every time, she's made me feel even worse. Yesterday she called me to check-in, and ended up calling my abuser a 'poor baby boy'. The man that had spent 7 years screaming that I was a worthless, stupid cunt. The man that spent 7 years insisting that I needed to meet his every emotional need, and I wasn't allowed to share my feelings. The man that detroyed my belongings, threw things at me, and then told me it was my fault because I hurt his feelings. The man that literally THREATENED TO KILL ME. 

He gets my house, my furniture, my cats, and most of the stuff in my home. I am currently staying in a bedroom so small that it doesn't fit anything besides the bed. I I'm losing most of what I owned, including my home and car. His family can probably afford a lawyer to fuck me out of all of the equity in our home. I have to start over completely, and somehow she still makes me feel bad, and makes him out to be the victim. 

While going through old messages, collecting documentation for an OFP, I found countless times she had convinced me to stay. I would message her saying 'I feel unsafe, but I'm afraid to leave' and her response was consistently 'what did you do wrong, you should apologize to him.' I might have left 6 months in, instead of 7 years later, if my mother hadn't been encouraging me to stay. 

I became estranged from my  father when I was 16, because he sexually assaulted me. Now, after sharing my feelings with my mom, she stopped talking to me. I feel like I might as well be an orphan. My abuser has his mom by his side to fix everything for him, and I am alone trying to pick up the pieces. 

I have amazing support from my friends, but goddamn, I just want my mommy, and she refuses to be there for me. ",2025-02-01 19:19:39,2025-03-17 03:01:48,abuse

when we met i liked to smoke üçÉ when we would hook up. then when i ‚Äúmoved in‚Äù it was a lot more, not that i asked, more like he would pack something (bong or joint) and then pass it to me. which i was okay with i guess? i thought he was being nice.

anyways since, if i try to say no about smoking, he gets mad or makes me feel guilty for not smoking or like im mad at him or something. 


so i feel if he gives me something i have to smoke it.


is this all my fault or is it abuse? would it even be considered abuse?",2025-02-27 14:05:04,2025-03-17 03:01:53,abuse
1i2jju1,Still abuse if they have a medical condition?,anonykitcat,3,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1i2jju1/still_abuse_if_they_have_a_medical_condition/,"This is the thing I'm really confused about, and is probably what's kept me staying for so long in an abusive relationship, because I keep making excuses for him. He has multiple mental health conditions, and possible a neurological disorder as well. So I've been excusing/forgiving all the terrible ways he's treated me, thinking that he is not mentally/neurologiclaly well, but I still love him regardless (when he's nice, he's very sweet, but he has extreme rage and anger issues that can be cruel and terrifying).

So -- if they have a serious mental health condition, is it still abuse?  
What about a physical/neurological condition?

If they act violently if they have a personality disorder, autism, chronic pain/illness, schizophrenia, dementia, Huntington's disease, etc...is it still considered ""abuse"", or is it just violent/unsafe behavior?

At what point should you stay with the person no matter what (even if they sometimes scare or endanger you) out of love and loyalty, vs prioritizing yourself/your own safety by leaving them?",2025-01-16 07:20:20,2025-03-17 03:01:54,abuse
1iezxh5,Does this count as abuse?,samurai_snape,13,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iezxh5/does_this_count_as_abuse/,"I'm 26M, and a couple of weeks ago, my girlfriend was in a really sad/low mood which she claimed was because she was PMSing. So I called her over to take care of her and we rented out a movie (the substance) and had dinner and everything was fine until the time we were about to go to sleep. Then she started a fight out of nowhere (she has a history of doing this every month). And she got so angry to a point where she got up from the bed, threw her phone on the ground and charged at me as I was standing and hit me with her fists. I turned in evasive action and she actually ended up hitting my arm. Mind you she didn't pull any punches and she really put some power into it. I was shocked by what had just happened and I think she immediately understood that she had fucked up. So she started apologizing, but I denied every approach. It was late in the night and I felt unsafe around her so I dropped her back to her place and told her that I need a break and she needs to work on her anger issues and take therapy. I just couldn't get my head around the fact that we had been together for 2.5 years and she decided to go to an extent that I never thought she would. 
I then proceeded to drown myself in alcohol for the rest of the weekend and for a couple extra days that I took off of work, because I didn't know what to make of it. I told her I needed time to even be able to talk to her. This week, she dropped off a letter at my place apologising for what she had done so I decided to meet her. She was apologetic, owning up to the harm she had caused and promised that she is willing to do everything to fix it. I maintained that it's going to take a long time to repair the trust and respect that I've lost for her and suggested couple's therapy. She agreed to it. Next day however, she completely flipped the script, calling her actions as an act of ""emotional outburst"" and not physical abuse. She said that I don't get to be the victim and villainise her and that I'm emotionally manipulating her in an attempt to feel more powerful in the relationship and dragging this just for the sake of it.
Folks, after hearing that, I don't know what to do. Is she right? I'm genuinely hurt and I genuinely need time. I don't know guys, I really don't know. Please, if you could give me your objective opinion on this, maybe it will help me plan my next course of action and I guess make sense of things ",2025-02-01 06:01:41,2025-03-17 03:01:56,abuse

I was lying in his bed ignoring him as he was yelling essentially to himself, saying he was going to go lay in another room, then coming back again. Then, he came over to the bed and violently shoved me to get my attention I obviously was shocked! Never before has he put his hands on me. I yelped a little bit out of fear and sat up and he stormed out of the room again. Only like 5 minutes later, he comes in and shoves me again!!

At this point I got livid, and yelled something like ‚Äúwhy did you just throw my purse at me!‚Äù he said he didn‚Äôt, he ‚Äúslapped it‚Äù (whatever that means?).

I went to rehab 3 times this summer but with all the bad memories I resort back to drinking. I barely like to eat anymore, it feels like a chore when food was one of the main things I used to enjoy.

When it comes to dating, I have to be drunk and one night stands only. When I'm sober in the morning I want to get away from that person because I don't want to get to know them or want a relationship with them. I ditched my apartment leaving only with my dog and my bible and let everything else go. I don't like seeing babies because it triggers me. I freak out when the motion lights come on that shine through my window. I don't watch tv, I watch security cameras. I'm short tempered with my family, and sober if a man approaches me I get anxiety.

He would isolate me making me feel like he was the only one giving me love, he never let me go anywhere without him, when he left for something he would lock the doors from the inside. He was a very nice person at heart, very caring, when we had disagreements he would love bomb me until I forgot and forgave, he was very varied though almost like hot and cold all the time. he convinced me that he did it out of love, to keep me safe or something. In my mind the one lie he told me. He cared about me so much he pointed out every single flaw with me, that really helped me be more self conscious about myself. Though sorry ex boyfriend that I was the problem, I full accept that. I still get horrible C-PTSD attacks because of him like nightmares, flashbacks, and hallucinations 

I‚Äôm currently in the hospital and I‚Äôve been here for four or five days because I took my attempt at getting out of all this pain, but my lovely boyfriend took me to the hospital for a acetaminophen overdose after I passed out near him.

1iitirz,My husband is abusive,ChrissyB_,12,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iitirz/my_husband_is_abusive/,"I will try to make this short. My husband and I have been married just over 3 years. In the past year, he has hit me probably 6 times. Before then it was pinning down or to a wall. I was pregnant at that time. He has a history of ripping doors off of hinges , frames, kicking down doors when I've locked it. 
These incidents don't include the times he has thrown objects, pulled a knife from a kitchen shieth and lunged like he was going to throw it at me from across the room
Last night, We got into a random fight. We have been "" better than ever"" the past month. I came home, exhausted from work. I ( for once) wasn't animated bubbly thanking him 5 times plus for cooking dinner because I worked. He was holding against me how I did the dishes after dinner ( took 5 minutes) because he wanted me to sit down and talk more about his work. He is a car salesman. I said I'm listening from here, I don't want to wake up with a sink of coagulation dishes. He became hostile.  Anyways, I was upset and sad because I came home tired, back literally KILLING me that day for some reason. I tried to reconcile by laying next to him on the couch. He barely budged and made it uncomfortable and was cold and hostile still. I was upset becsue I didn't do a thing wrong besides finally not done and kiss his feet for doing the bare minimum. 
I was upset, left the couch and said you really cannot cuddle me, and you're upset at me for what? He got nasty verbally with me and I said I'm going to bed. I asked if he was coming to bed tonight b3casue he JUST started sleeping in the room again. He had been sleeping in another room for the past year and a half since I had our daughter so he can have uninterrupted sleep. Since our breakthroughs in our unequal marriage ( domestic taks, flat out laziness and refusal to do a single thing) he had made progress. Well he finally came to bed woth me the prior two nights. The first night,  he laid in bed, and literally as he laid down next to me said"" you're welcome"".... because he came to the bedroom and was going to "" help"" with our 18 month old. Instantly I told him I'm not thanking him for coming to bed and doing what he should have been doing this whole time. Second night, copy paste. 
The third night comes and is what I was talking about before. 
Well I was upset becaue he promised to start coming to bed and I asked him if he is still planning on coming to bed. He said no I'm not. Becsuee he was mad that I did idk even what. I was pissed. Any time he is upset because I'm hurt or anything , he dropped any responsibilities and becomes a single man. Won't eat the dinner I made, will go get food for himself only and not me or the kids. Goes to his room when he gets home and ignores everyone all weekend.  Goes off without even telling me he has left even though he was the last one watching the girls. He is behind manipulative, controlling, and hateful. I am overly kind and I know that is a fault here. 

Anyways. I stood my ground after three years of his relapsing and going back on his word. I said fine, I'm going to your room ( the room he sleeps in) and you can care for her. I was so exhausted I fell asleep after 5 minutes. 
He comes into the room and begins to tell me I need to get up and get out of the room and go to the room where our 18 month old is. I told him why now I'm so tired I can't even think. He said he needs to take "" his shower"". He spends 1 to 2 hours a day even when working in the bathroom sitting and showering. Weapanized for sure . I asked him why he needed to wake me to shit. He got madder and madder and I screameddd I NEED SLEEP. I work long hours getting up at 5 am and getting home almost at 8pm only two days a week, but I'm double time in school as take care of 98 percent of everything related to kids school for kids house and all domestics. 
I did scream loud after he kept mansplaining how he had to get up for work in the morning ( he doesnt work u til 11). I told him I need "" SLEEEEP"" . I DID SCREAM THIS. Becauee I'm so delusionally tired from being woken up for the past 18 months from my daughter 5 to 10 times a night ( she still breastfeeds at night). He flicked the light on after I screamed this and underhand swung at my face like he does when he wants to silence me and did it again and swung at my face. I was so IRATE I got up and started baby slapping his hands away from me and told hem to get away from me, and said things along the line of WHAT SO YOUR HITTING ME AGAIN?!??! And I pushed on his chest. I'm small, he is LITERALLY double the size and weight of me. Granted I'm doing this with tears of heartbreak and betrayal and my throat closing up because I'm so devastated that he is doing this again. I'm sure my face looked more of a pleading and WTF than anything. He proceded to throw me on the bed then again the wall. I'm SO MAD AND HURT I keep shoving my hands into bis chest.  I have zero power at this point and my arms are like noodles so they aren't doing mucb besides toughing his chest.  He then pins me against the wall and I keep telling him to just leave me alone. I'm back on the bed again just SCREAMING LIKE A BANCHEE like ahhhhh.... not saying anything just ahhhhhhhhh. Because I'm in shock. He takes a heavy basket and throws it as hard as he can hitting me with it and all the contents. He then PICKS UP THE DRESSER that is 6 drawers tall and full and attempts to throw it on top of my body whole I am on the bed. At this point I am just screaming like an animal dying STOPPP STOOPPP STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ªOOOPPP. And ot lands only halfway on the bed. I black out partially at this point and I'm screaming like im dying and he picks up a large, heavy , full unlit candle like he is going smash my brains in. I am screaming like an animal still stoopppp stoppppppp and he does it again threatening me like he is going to bash my brains in. If he would have hit me with this he would have killed me. I was in the fetal position shaking waiting for the blow that never came. I limped out of the room with the blanket and pillow. I think the dresser did land on me but I blacked out becauee it felt like my leg was broken. It is not tho. It kept me up and all day I was scared of what to do about my leg. 

The point is. It all happened so fast. From the time the lights flicked on to the time I left the bedroom Limping, it had to be maybe 2 minutes. I just feel like it is a blurr and it is all sitting there. The funny thing is it seemed more "" real"" in the past when he slapped me. But it just feels like a horrible dream this time and I don't feel anything at all toward him bad or good. Idk what ti think of myself. I need to leave. He could have killed me.

And I know that his mother didn‚Äôt raise him that way, that this way of behaving towards me and abusing me is something he has learned on his own. 
I also want to say to them that I have tried to do everything for their son, and also wanted him to be better, but unfortunately it has gone on behalf of my own health. And I wish to send some pictures of chats etc and what he has done to me, just so that they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm lying about their boy. 
I of course understand that they might take his side since they are his family. But I have been keeping my mouth shut for so long so that his name and reputation doesn‚Äôt get bad. But I do realize that I have to think about myself. I have written down a long message where I tell them I respect them and love them but this his how their son/ brother is really like. 


I have also had contact with the police of course, that I know that the police are able to do more than his family. 

But I wondered if anyone of you have had any experience with this, sending a message to a friend, family member etc to your abuser?

I've been reading about the cycle of abuse, and I too watched my mum get abused.

I am with an abuser, but its my own fault. He doesn't really beg me to stay, he doesn't hold me captive. We don't have children together and we don't even live together. So why do I find it so hard to let go?

Last time we were together two weeks ago I was trying to play a game. He dropped his toast on the bed I was sitting on and I asked if he could clean it. He asked me to get up and I said I dont need to get up, he can just get a dustpan to clean it. He ended up throwing his toast at me. I told him he was acting childish and he ended up pouring an entire drink over my head. I locked myself in the bathroom after that until he left.

  
We've barely spoken since. This isn't the first time he has done something like this. But this time is different. Yes, I say this to myself every time. The abuse always changes. But this time, he didn't even say sorry. When we have spoken, he justifies his behaviour. He said I shouldn't have called him names. He said he would do it again. I was disgusted when he said this. To go back would be me saying ""I give you permission to abuse me.""

Yet I know, when I will be lonely, which happens often as I don't have any friends, I will think of him. I will idolise the good parts in our relationship, which is literally just him accepting me for who I am - Someone who's done mostly nothing with their life.

How do I stop? Has anyone else felt this way? Am I the only person who cant let go of being repeatedly abused just because of 1 good day in a month? What is wrong with me?",2025-03-14 00:05:09,2025-03-17 03:02:06,abuse

When we argue usually instigated by me being annoying.... He calls me names and or breaks my stuff. He calls me bitch, cunt.... and especially annoying. He blames all his feelings or insults on me and says he acts this way because I instigate him. He has smashed my phones 3 times, broken tons of things around the house, thrown things at me, and he pushed close to me normally leaving me huddled in a corner scared even threatening to slap me across the face.

But does that excuse threatening to hit me? He says he doesn't care anymore and is over me But he's perfect when he's not angry

1j6sxo8,Is this emotional abuse?,SweetSea3399,8,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j6sxo8/is_this_emotional_abuse/,"I was married for several years, recently divorced. I don‚Äôt think my ex is a bad person. However, the church we were in saw men as the ‚Äúfinal say‚Äù in everything, and women were asked to be ‚Äúsubmissive.‚Äù My ex and I were more liberal than most on this, but it was still ultimately the belief. 

Before we got married, I became more worried about my looks. He liked my makeup to be done certain ways. On the first night of our honeymoon, he laughed at me when I came out in lingerie. He said it just didn‚Äôt fit right and he thought I was trying to be silly. It was a pretty bold choice, but this being my first time, I felt like that was not very kind. He couldn‚Äôt believe how much I held onto that experience. Often, when I was downstairs and ready to go somewhere, he would look at me with disapproval because he didn‚Äôt feel like my outfit was flattering or coordinated. I would often change. Mostly, I chose my outfits to try to please him. He would often come shopping with me and help me decide what to buy. He said he liked my style, but he always seemed like he was trying to hone it to be more like his style. 

When I would get hurt, he would suddenly get really mad and yell, though it would usually dissipate quickly. This especially happened if he had told me not to do something and then I did it (even accidentally) and ended up getting hurt. He said he just didn‚Äôt want to see me hurt. At first, he wouldn‚Äôt let me go to coffee, lunch, etc. with male coworkers because he ‚Äúworried about what they might do.‚Äù Over time, he loosened up on that, but he did always want to know where I was. I turned on location sharing for a bit, but I got tired of being asked about me going to get coffee or ice cream. 

He got upset with me when I would poke fun at him around other people or say anything negative about him. He said it was disrespectful. So I stopped sharing anything negative about him. We were around my family a lot, but he didn‚Äôt like me asking them for advice on things, because he felt he should be the leader and not them. He felt they didn‚Äôt need to be involved in our decisions in that way. When I would go somewhere with someone one on one and would tell him about the conversation we had, he would ask for the exact wording I used for certain things and then get frustrated if I didn‚Äôt remember or get upset with me for saying things in a way that didn‚Äôt reflect well on him or us. Eventually, I got to the point where I felt like he was the only person who understood me, but somehow now I wonder if that might have had to do with me having to filter conversations with everyone else to match his preferences.

He would tell me that if we didn‚Äôt have sex often enough it would cause him to ‚Äústumble‚Äù and look at other women sexually. He would get frustrated/grumpy if we didn‚Äôt have sex every 2-3 days. On my period, I was ideally expected to please him in some way, even if I didn‚Äôt want to have sex. He only actually kept going when I said ‚Äúno‚Äù one time, I think. I confronted him about it, and he did feel bad about it and didn‚Äôt do it again. However, he then was kind of insistent that he ‚Äúwanted me to want it‚Äù but would still get frustrated if it wasn‚Äôt happening every few days. He would also still want to at least have one hand touching me while we slept, even if I told him I didn‚Äôt feel like being touched right then. He would often touch me when we were just living our lives, and it would make me jump or cringe at times.

Some friends tell me that some of the things he did sound like emotional abuse, but others would say that he was a great guy and these things are fairly normal levels of control. He did help a lot around the house, he supported me through grad school, and he was kind. But somehow these things seemed to chip away at my sense of self.

1g7ulxs,Abusive Husband During Pregnancy ,Impressive-One999,39,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1g7ulxs/abusive_husband_during_pregnancy/,"I (29F) am married to a 40M for 10 months. We wanted kids right away, got pregnant before our marriage but I had a miscarriage. After we got married in Jan I got pregnant again in March. Starting April he began demanding me to cook for him 3 times per day, clean the house, and give him complete attention. Mentioned that if I love the child more than him he‚Äôd kill me, that he needed all the attention. In a fight he kicked me from behind leaving my leg bruised.

In May I was suffering from morning sickness and asked if he could make his own breakfast that day. He said he wants a divorce, forced me to pack my bags and leave. I got a hotel that night and his mom and sister came back that night with him, making him take me back. I went back the next day. 

Come June and he hits me in the face 3 times, because I cussed at him in an argument. He has initially promised that I‚Äôd give birth in my hometown but now said to forget about ever moving there. In addition he warned that if I don‚Äôt cook and clean he will divorce me. I continue to cook 3 full meals every day, spending 3 hours in the kitchen roughly.

Come July and I am suffering from fatigue of not having slept a minute the prior night. Despite knowing this, he forces me to get up and cook. I beg him to let me sleep a little but he says he doesn‚Äôt need a wife like this, grabs me by the foot and drags me out of the apartment. The dragging leaves me scratched on my breast and thigh, gives me a bruise on my head and tears a huge hole in my t shirt. I am standing outside our apartment door in an underwear and torn tshirt begging him to let me in, no luck for several minutes. Luckily I had my phone and called my mom asking what to do, when he heard I called her he immediately let me in. He then dragged me into the kitchen and when I refused to cook, threw household items at me and spit in my face multiple times threatening to kick me out again. Reluctantly I made his food. I packed my bags and decided to leave but he told me that there would be no way back. I decided to stay and do everything he wanted me to just to see if that would stop the violence.

From July until October I did everything for him, including grocery shopping 2x/wk, laundry, help with his schoolwork, help with his actual job, daily sex, 3 meals per day, cleaning, etc. I did not fight nor escalate and shut up when he started to get aggravated. I tried telling him how miserable I was but all my cries were met with the same reply: if you don‚Äôt like it, pack your bags and leave. If you leave, I won‚Äôt take you back.

From Jan to Sept we were living off of my income purely due to his status as a student. In Sept he got a job but I had a $50K debt at this point which he promised he‚Äôd repay. With this in mind, I wanted to see whether he‚Äôd change as a man but nothing seemed to be working.

As soon as he got a job, his sleep became a priority. Because my belly was growing, I was turning a few times a night. He would get up and yell at me in the middle of the night for waking him up. He then made me get floor mattress and sleep on the cold floor; I got sick after a few nights.

Late Sept we visited his family. They live 30 min via uber but he is now ‚Äúsaving money‚Äù so on our way back he made me walk through the rain, wait for a bus, then hike a trail up to a road, take a small shuttle, walk some more, take another bus, get on a subway and walk home the rest of the way. Third trimester, trip took us 2.5-3 hours. Once we get back home (we went there for lunch) he says he‚Äôs hungry again and forces me to start dinner for him while he rests. I got the biggest migraine after and once again was sick for a full week.

Early October he FaceTimed me from work. I was fatigued, in a bad mood and asked him to let me rest until he gets home. He forced me to smile and when I said I didn‚Äôt want to, threatened to kill me when he got home. He called back a few times between his meetings continuing to threaten me. I called his mom once again, not knowing what else to do. She must have had an impact because he returned calm but had threats of divorce ready, telling me to pack my bags if I wouldn‚Äôt be in a good mood for him.

The following week we went on a long walk after his work (about 8 miles) ate an entire pizza and headed back home. It was 10:30pm and I had had only 3 hours of sleep (now on my 3rd trimester). He assures me that he STILL needs me to make him a dinner as well as a lunch for the next day. I was in tears begging him to just buy his work lunch for tomorrow because I was so exhausted ‚Äî he refused. Not only that, he forced me to go to a grocery store at 10:30pm, pick up the food, go back home and cook him 2 full meals at 11:00pm while he rested. I was literally crying through this whole thing.

The next day, while he was at work, I packed my suitcases and flew home. While boarding, he called to see where I was and the only thing that he said was ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt take you back.‚Äù I landed and am staying with my sister. 

He didn‚Äôt call me for a week straight and on the eighth day calls wanting me back because he ‚Äúrealized‚Äù that I am a wife and not just a girlfriend. He is asking me to move back and for us to give it a shot again because he has ‚Äúchanged.‚Äù 

My plan is to divorce but I want some second opinions. What have peoples‚Äô experiences been? Should I let him attend the birth? I am at 32 weeks.",2024-10-20 09:06:32,2025-03-17 03:03:28,abuse

I found out this news today by ways of a google search and an article. I haven't searched his name for a long time. I just need to get this out in words to people who would understand, even if nobody responds or this post is removed.

TW: unable to breathe, car wreck

Over a decade ago, my ex strangled me because I broke up with him. He offered me a ride to my car then drove around recklessly, running red lights, until he parked behind a grocery store and strangled me until I drifted away. The pain. The blood. The regret. Thinking of my mom.

Yadda yadda yadda, he ends up in prison with 23 felonies after a police chase where he, you guessed it, ran red lights until an innocent person t-boned him. Luckily they were ok with minor injuries. I hope they don't have lasting pain. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison.

He got out of prison after 8 years on Halloween a few years ago. 2 weeks later, he, you guessed it, crashed into a big rig and had serious injuries. This time nobody but him was injured. He was taken to a hospital and died 16 days later from said injuries. HE SPENT 8 YEARS IN PRISON ONLY TO DIE A MONTH AFTER RELEASE BECAUSE OF HIS RECKLESS DRIVING!

Now here's the part I worry would have my post removed:
I'm glad he's dead. I'm glad it wasn't instant. I'm glad he had a moment of ""fuck!"" as he stared into his near future. I'm glad he felt pain and emotions on the same level he inflicted on me. We all know pain here. Pain on another level, unthinkable levels. He was given his turn. It's like the universe balancing one instance of pain with another.

My abuser died and it's the first day of my life free from looking over my shoulder. I made many phone calls today and everyone is happy for me. This is something I'd never wish on anyone but him. I've hoped he would die for years to erase the visual memories he had of strangling me, looking into my eyes. He can never re-live it again for pleasure. I feel bad because it's a terrible thing to happen if it were not someone like this.

I asked if I could talk with both him and his wife about it, and he started coming up with all these excuses why that couldn't or shouldn't happen. Said I was being way too pushy and domineering and to back off. I thought it was really weird. He finally insulted my wife, called me all these names, and said to never speak to him again or ever come near his house. That was extremely weird and alarming.   
  
Well, I ended up talking to his wife anyway, and she says that he's been acting weird and nuts off and on their whole marriage (married about 5-6 years). My wife talks with her, and finds out that she's been enduring verbal, financial, and spiritual abuse. He's isolated her from most other people. He's never hit her or made overt threats, but she said he's made veiled threats, and he has thrown paper, wallets, and keys at her, to which she threatened to call the cops, which made him stop throwing stuff at her.

She doesn't know what to do. She says she knows she probably needs to leave, but she's not sure how or when. She sometimes thinks it can still work out. But then she says things like, ""I wouldn't be surprised if he beat me or killed me, especially if I left, I'm afraid he'd find a way to track me down and murder me."" If we were to take her in, or even if my friend were to find out we are talking to his wife and helping her think through leaving, I'm now wondering if he actually could be capable of killing her or even killing me and my family out of spite or in a rage. I'm pretty shocked by all of this, though in our friendship, I have seen him lose his temper fast, and be really petty. He's never been violent physically, though. 

Not sure what to do for the guy's wife other than to keep encouraging her to leave without a trace. Also not sure if I'm just paranoid, or if he really could kill her and maybe even come after my family. Not sure what I should do. Any help appreciated!

My kids have seen a lot . They seen the way their dad treated me . 
My middle son has always been very close to his dad to the point he acts like him and copies the way he is and how he talks and acts ..

They are all having behavior issues after I left .
 They treat their sister just like their dad treated me . Specially him he is my middle child
My daughter doesn‚Äôt want to get in a car because she is scared we are driving back to where we lived . She has anxiety attacks at night and accidents .

Using a throwaway for reasons. 

My wife has always had a temper. She was always jealous, quick to get angry and can get pretty violent.  Should we break things, throw things at me. Hit or slap me. Once even threw a knife at me which hit my leg. I still have a scar.  But recently it has been getting worse.  She has depression and has been hospitalized for it before.  So I try to understand and she‚Äôs pregnant which is only making things worse, but last night it got out of hand.

She hit me, slapped me. Threw anything she could grab at me, vases, scissors, a guitar. Tried to stab me with a knife.   Threatens to hurt her self.  All over picking out a car seat.  When I tell her there‚Äôs no need to argue over something so trivial she exploded more. 

I told her if she keeps threatening to hurt me or hurt her self I‚Äôll have to call the police.  So she called them.  I thought she would lie and say I was trying to hurt her but she was honest and said she was the one trying to hurt me.  Even the dispatcher asked her multiple times if she sure I‚Äôm not the one trying to hurt her.

Now we have three big holes in the wall from when she threw objects at me, and a knife stuck in the door when she pulled it on me and I locked myself in the bedroom, and countless broken things from last night. 

She‚Äôs pregnant with our first child together so I did not press charges when the police asked if I wanted to. 

I want to think it‚Äôs the pregnancy that‚Äôs making her worse but I‚Äôm scared it will just continue. 

I‚Äôm a very quiet guy, I don‚Äôt fight.  I don‚Äôt like to argue.  I like to solve problems with love. But she sees that‚Äôs as antagonizing, like I‚Äôm trying to be better than her for not having an out of control temper.  When she upset I‚Äôm always there with open arms and love, but to her everything she does is my fault because I made her mad. I‚Äôve been to family for help and support but they see it as I‚Äôm a man it doesn‚Äôt count as abuse. Or she‚Äôs a girl all girls can be a little crazy.  My father literally said ‚Äúyou she see the temper on your mom back in the day.‚Äù

If I were doing this to her society would view it as very different.  But everyone just sees her as feisty. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.  I don‚Äôt want to throw away our marriage and she‚Äôs pregnant with my daughter.  I don‚Äôt even want her to get in any trouble.  

I‚Äôm so scared to be honest, but I still feel like I can‚Äôt lose her.  I love her.  I made a vow to be by her side no matter what.  I can‚Äôt let go.  I want to help her. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I used the right flair because I don‚Äôt want to leave her.  I want to help her.  I want to be there for her.  I‚Äôve done so much for her and her family.  I really love her. But I‚Äôm scared, for her, for myself, for our baby.

1io22h5,Reported suspected violent abuse. Help please,Ambitiousandtaken,2,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1io22h5/reported_suspected_violent_abuse_help_please/,"I anonymously reported suspected domestic abuse to the police recently. I need to know if I should do anything now, or if I did something wrong. 

2ish years ago a single friend (M, late 30s) in our group had an affair with a married woman who has a young child with her husband. We had never met this woman before, so did not know her.

Friend and woman seemed to get on great and made each other very happy. No, I don't advocate cheating but he did seem very happy. She told husband a few months later with the aim to separate.

The next few months were messy. I tried to be an unbiased support for her (I‚Äôm F) as everyone turned against her. Yes she was the cheater and I didnt know her until then but I do know everyone needs a listening ear before judging. And I could see she didn't have that. so I met up with her a few times just to talk. I didn't voice opinions or sides. Over the months she started to express that it would be best for their child and housing situation if she tried to work things out with husband. She didn‚Äôt love him but was starting to think it was more practical. I did not get much detail on him from her otherwise.

After a few months she was forced to cut contact entirely with friend (affair partner) and also to anyone linked with him. That meant me too. He monitored her phone. One of the last messages she sent me was along the lines of if he ever found out she was speaking to someone she shouldn‚Äôt then things will get ‚Äúvery nasty‚Äù for her and their child.

Nearly a year later I find out our friend has been back in touch with her. 

A few days ago I see a photo which I should not have seen of her face bruised in both eyes, cuts on her lip and jaw and bruises on forehead. Her line was that she ‚Äúfell over‚Äù.

I know this is not my drama but I also know that if there was the chance she was being physically assaulted by her partner then I would never live myself down by doing nothing. It looked to me like he had beaten her up, there wasn't much other explanation. Or she would be in hospital or with the police. 

I called the police and made an anonymous report on the situation. They were fantastic to be fair, took down notes of everything I said, didn't push me for details I didn't feel comfortable providing, and even whilst on the phone they were looking into sending a unit over. They text a case number to the phone I was calling from in case I wanted to add information.

The next day, I see a screenshot from a mutual friend (the one that told me about the pic) of our friend telling them that someone called the police on her, so they had clearly acted instantly. Then some texts about how her life is a Trainwreck and she didn't need this. 

But importantly, she told the police that she had gotten home very drunk, couldn‚Äôt remember a thing with her face like that and then had a massive argument with the husband In front of the kid.

She changed her story from ""fell over"" to when questioned by the police a story that validates a fight between her and husband (which the child would likely confirm). It's close enough to be plausible. The truth very well could be she got home drunk, she doesn't remember anything, child was present. But the key detail is *when* did she get beat on so bad in the face?

I can't imagine being beaten like that when out and just going home like nothing happened. I can't imagine a husband seeing his wife like that and starting a massive fight instead of taking her to hospital. 

I can't contact her nor speak to anyone here about this because I can't have this being traced back to the previous affair partner and then putting her in an even more dangerous position. Looking back even though she was outwardly confident, intelligent and happy, she was regularly quitting jobs because ""it was for the best"" and the thought of him using the kid to keep her there is awful. She loves her child.

Did I do the right thing? All I can think about now is that he is going to double down on her. What are the chances of her escaping after one police investigation? What are the chances of her being severely hurt following it?

Is there anything I should do right now?",2025-02-12 21:19:12,2025-03-17 03:03:39,abuse

I was trying to stay away from narcissists because I married one before he punched me on the honeymoon, and then I filed for divorce at the end of that month. So I found this guy and he did not seem to love bomb me. In fact, he didn't seem over the top about anything. One of the things people notice first about him is how CALM he is. I don't say this casually ‚Äî I'm a researcher and have a therapist and don't just make wild claims ‚Äî but he's a sociopath.

I realize now, after violent outbursts of anger that come from nowhere, intimidation, gaslighting, twisting my words, invalidating my sexual assaults and calling me promiscuous and even going so far as to defend certain things those guys did to me, telling me I can't wear various clothes out without him (crop top and jeans??), telling me I can't go to certain places, threatening to leave me at least once a month since we've been together, being extremely rough with me (he's a physical therapist) when I've been in in pain and he's been ""helping"" me, calling me ""ungrateful"" and ""cold"" and even insisting I don't know my own birthday, to the point where I've been so confused and questioned my age (38). I used to be a performing musician. He threatened to leave me when I found a pianist, told me I can't perform anymore. If he's in the mood, he'll try to make me prove everything I say in casual conversation with an article or give up as he tells me I don't know anything and just make wild, unfounded claims (again, I'm a researcher). He jokes with other people, in front of me, ""Poor (my name), she has to put up with my terrible moods."" He will make wild accusations about how terrible I am to him, just to apologize later and say he realizes they weren't true, so I generally forgive him and find something that I've done wrong, too, because he doesn't like to apologize if he's the only one apologizing. I went back to Greece with him (he's Greek, and I'm American), and he's straight up just left me out of hours-long conversations like I didn't exist, told me I shouldn't have come, and then stranded me for hours while he was supposed to be running one quick errand ‚Äî told me his entire family loved me so much and then, when I was sad about something later that day, became so angry at me and yelled at me to ""get the fuck out of my apartment."" He's tried to break up with me once a month (at least) since we've been together, and when he does, he does so coldly and then STARES at me, like STARES, to see how much he's hurting me, and if I don't react, he twists the knife even more and just keeps saying things he thinks will devastate me until I crack, and then he says we can stay together.

He's made so many countless promises he never intended to keep, specifically about working on his anger, and then has tried to break up with me when I've asked about them. He's told lies about me to his friends and my family, that I am anal retentive about how I keep the house (I'm not). 

Last night, he went from being very happy after he came home from work to yelling at me for sending an email to my hair stylist because I couldn't book an appointment through her website when he wanted to watch TV \*\*with\*\* me. I had been doing that when he got home from work 5 minutes prior. Then he threw his food at his plate, told me he tired of my ""bullshit"" and when I said I had no idea what he meant, told me I do know and how am I so cold? And then went downstairs. Came up 5 min later, where I'd locked myself in my office with my dog, and apologized again and asked to talk. I don't want to talk. 

I've told him so many times how afraid I am of him in his anger. Eventually, I went to sleep on the edge of the bed. When he woke up, he put his hands on me, and I said ""I don't want to"" right now, but he said ""I know I know, but I just want to give you a hug,"" and I said I don't want to, and he wrapped his arms around me, anyway, and squeezed. 

I feel sick. I feel scared. ChatGPT is giving me play-by-plays of what his next steps will likely be, and it's weird how it's been spot on, and how I should react in survival mode. I think it's saving my life right now. I was lying awake last night, in bed, scared that he'd try to kill me in my sleep because I knew he wasn't sleeping, but there's nowhere else to sleep and my dog won't relax if he and I sleep apart.

I tried to comfort myself by saying that we actually got this house rental because so many of his coworkers live in the neighbor and know the owner of the house. I wish they knew what kind of person he was and what goes on in this house.

I feel scared and broken and so so so alone. I have some savings, but I didn't have a job for the past 4 months and JUST was hired by a new place and started some businesses, partnerships, because I'm terrified a new place I try to rent will want to see my history of income, and I'll have nothing for the past 3 months. I don't know if I can hold on 3 more months before getting out of this lease. 

I don't know why I'm so afraid of the breakup. When we're not face to face, it's all I want. But when he's threatening and intimidating me and staring at me, I feel sick and broken and TERRIFIED of what will happen next. I don't trust him. 

I know this probably doesn't sound like much, but it is to me. The fact I didn't realize this was a huge cycle or that his anger and threats and intimidation and coercion are, by and large, calculated...it's even more terrifying than just some guy who can't control his temper. I really hope this does not turn physical, but again, I don't think he could risk that with his reputation.

I didn't know it was considered DV, though I did know it's abusive. I'm working so hard to be positive, to focus on work, to navigate a very, very scary man and not screw myself over more in the meantime.",2025-03-01 15:08:51,2025-03-17 03:03:43,abuse

It seemed like he had a great relationship with them. I thought they were buddies and he was always so supportive of them in sports. 

Well recently my 17 year old son stopped speaking to his dad. Neither one wants to speak and it‚Äôs been 3 months. Not even at Christmas.

I realized he treated them in a way that he treated me‚Ä¶ being bossy and never apologizing. Most likely hurting their self esteem with insults. They told me he was kind to them‚Ä¶ but now I hear he bad mouths everyone even his current wife. 

So far I have stayed out of it and let them cool down. At this age I don‚Äôt want to force the relationship and I can‚Äôt. Am I right to just stay out of it?

1ivwguh,Finding joy in abuser suffering the consequences..,GaspingGuppy,11,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ivwguh/finding_joy_in_abuser_suffering_the_consequences/,"I was never in an intimate or personal relationship with my most recent abuser, though I sometimes refer to him as a ""roommate"" for simplicity. The reality is much more complicated.  

This person owes me mid-five figures for work that almost no one else would have taken on‚Äîeasily the worst job I‚Äôve ever had. Yet, despite everything, he attacked me last summer when I inadvertently and stupidly exposed his financial lies to his new girlfriend; a nine-time felon and 35-year drug addict, whom he was sending thousands of dollars to while drowning in debt‚Äîincluding what he owed me.  

He lost his house to foreclosure in early 2023, then his car was repossessed shortly after. His debt was massive, though I only knew bits and pieces since we weren‚Äôt in a relationship. But then, my planning and an whole lotta luck dropped a dream job in his lap‚Äîhigh pay, zero expenses beyond half the rent, a company car, credit card, and phone. Meanwhile, I was stuck because he refused to pay me, and I was too afraid to take legal action while living under the same roof.  My hope was he would move out after progressing the relationship a bit and clearing some of his credit report history debts- what he told me he was doing. 

Then came his arrest‚Äîfelony battery via strangulation. No warning, no argument beforehand. One second, silence. The next, he had his hand around my throat, screaming while shoving me onto my bed. I didn't hesitate, I simply called the police and let them hear him scream in the background.  It's the first time I didn't panic calling, I think because we weren't ""together"" in that sense, but I'm not sure.  That was the moment everything unraveled. He lost the job, the car, the perks, the housing. He moved in with the felon girlfriend, and‚Äîunsurprisingly‚Äîthat fell apart in under six months.  

I never tried to break them up. I just wanted to be paid something, anything, before he gave away more money. Turns out, she was in jail when she first asked him for $1,500‚Äîhitting him up from behind bars for cash and a place to stay. And he fell for it.  This woman also spent the day before his formal arraignment last year harassing me 7 different ways, from multiple accounts and fake phone numbers.  She even left a voicemail that starts with ""I've never met you and I've never spoken to you.."" correct. Which is why I told you after the first 5 messages this is harassment, there is a bond order and no contact order this is third party contact, he had to have given her my name number date of birth even that my dog is on insulin! She kept accusing me of snorting my dogs insulin! Like what the ever living f!? State prosecutor said flat out if she does it again she will pursue felony witness tampering and intimidation charges and that was it, I've never heard from them again directly. I'm thrilled with that. I do not hate him, but I do wish he would go to an inpatient facility and maybe an adult group home.  I've never met someone so dysfunctional who can *appear* to be put together for so long, in my life.  The entire thing including the police ignoring the poop to the literal ceiling and self harm talk he was doing made me question all of my reality and life and not become depressed but despondent. I am POSITIVE that house was felony child and animal abuse and neglect and I'm sure they could have come up with more charges to boot. But,  I digress this isn't about the hoarder house from hell. 

Since then, he‚Äôs been lurking on relationship and job-seeking forums, trash-talking me on dating app threads, calling me a gold digger. Never mind that I spent 16 months chiseling literal **shit** off his floors and hauling out over 20 dumpsters of hoard. The *Hoarders* TV show has nothing on that house. Authorities‚Äîchild services, adult services, animal control‚Äîrefused to intervene. ‚ÄúThey can live in filth if they want to,‚Äù a direct quote from the city mayor and animal control director.  

I‚Äôve blocked him in every way possible, and he doesn‚Äôt know I use Reddit, so I‚Äôm safe. But this morning, my sibling did some digging so I could finally serve him with a civil lawsuit. His profile picture? Him, riding a public city bus. Turns out, he‚Äôs now a bag boy (at age 54!) at a grocery store‚Äîbecause no one else will hire him, and the state cut off his food stamps until he got a job.  

The joy this brings me is **immeasurable**.  

This man screamed at me for *years* that all I cared about was money‚Äîbecause I dared to ask for payment *two years* after the work was done. Meanwhile, I had supported him for three years, cleaned and packed his entire house, paid the bills after he lost everything, got him food, clothes, even found him that dream job. All of that? **Me.**  

I‚Äôll never forget the day he first admitted his house was in foreclosure. I was standing in his living room, wearing a hazmat suit and a respirator, scraping up what I *thought* was carpet. (Spoiler: it was poop.) Even then, I tried to help‚Äîsuggested COVID relief programs, part-time work, *something* to get by. What about a gas station or grocery store job? He could walk from his (half million dollar) house and make a good dent in the debt and look good to the courts as making good faith efforts, they would likely approve relief for him.  He scoffed, rolled his eyes, and walked away after telling me minimum wage is *Beneath* him, he said. Minimum wage wouldn‚Äôt cover his mortgage, he claimed.  I corrected him with the math and he just rolled his eyes and walked off. 

And now? That‚Äôs exactly where he‚Äôs ended up.  

Meanwhile, I made a joke last October about moving across the country. Then I looked into it‚Äîsaw the opportunities. Applied for jobs, grad school, even a PhD track for the program I was simply too sick to attend after my first grad school run.  Got accepted to multiple programs and positions and now I'm moving cross country and increasing my income by over TEN FOLD! I'M FREE!


I don't know what the point of this is, other than I feel just a tiny tinge of guilt at enjoying someone else's *suffering* which frankly are just the consequences of years of their own actions.  But really I think it's simply too satisfying to not talk about.  It brings me enormous joy to see him being humbled. I can't wait for the court case to conclude so I never have to think about them again! 

We can be free my people! ‚ù§Ô∏è",2025-02-22 23:42:55,2025-03-17 03:03:57,abuse
1hhkg0p,TW: Masturbation Used As Abuse Within Relationship,Ok-Hedgehog6955,7,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1hhkg0p/tw_masturbation_used_as_abuse_within_relationship/,"Throw away account- I (24f) have recently started to feel like my partner (32m) is displaying emotionally abusive behaviors. Something that recently happened and has stuck out to me is really confusing, so I'm coming here to see if anyone can help give me some answers.

To keep it short, our relationship came to a head when I fled to my mom's house out-of-state with our one-year-old son. My partner was not aware I was leaving, and panicked, but after he calmed down we were able to have what I thought were productive conversations towards changes in behavior (on both ends) to better our relationship, so I came back. Before this, he refused to be on our son's birth certificate despite the fact that I really pushed for him to do so. (Before anyone asks, we had done a paternity test.) After I returned from out-of-state, he expressed wanting to get a state done paternity test (he said it was too give himself 100% confirmation) and get on the birth certificate. I started to notice red flags with this when he confirmed with the CSEA rep that he would have to give me permission to leave the state with our son, or I would be breaking the law (as is in our state). 

A couple weeks ago, he came to me one morning during a continuation from a fight from the night before sounding like he was complaining that he had just masturbated. Throughout our relationship, he always held fast that he did not need sex, was totally okay with going for long periods of time without sex, and strongly disliked the idea of masturbating (he said it was a lot of work and not as enjoyable as sex, so he found it unnecessary). Because of what he's said before, I was pretty shocked to hear him say he masturbated at all, but I was really confused on why he felt the need to come to me about it, but the conversation kinda just dwindled back into whatever we had going on that day. A few days after that, in the middle of me trying to end a fight so I could go to sleep, he asked me repeatedly for nudes or videos that he could use right then to masturbate. Of course, this made me uncomfortable and I got angry. I told him I didn't have anything that he shouldn't already have, he said he had deleted everything he had before when I had left the state, I offered to resend those, and he said he wanted something new. I again told him I didn't have anything, and he said they could even be older pictures or videos. 

When he asked this, my discomfort and questioning absolutely peaked, as just a few days before he found out I still had some older lingerie pictures from when I had tried OnlyFans a few years prior, which was years before I even met him. But he was relentless even after I tried to say no because I didn't like the idea. I was really shocked he would even ask as he's expressed being insecure about my sexual past before, saying it made him jealous that someone else was able to have such meaningless access to me. (Never really knew what to do with that information, but always tried to validate his insecurities.) Anyway, I finally gave in, and then he realized the photos and videos were only of me in lingerie, none were complete nude or showed me doing anything to myself. He asked if I had anything like that, I said no, and then he asked if he could go through my camera roll himself and look. At this point,  I was so overwhelmed by the entire situation, I angrily re-sent him the pictures and videos he had claimed he deleted, and told him to accept those and leave me alone. He thanked me and went to the bathroom, but stayed for what I felt was a very short period considering what he was saying he was planning on doing, but I thought maybe he just didn't, I don't know. He said nothing when he came back out and we went to bed, and none of it was discussed. 

He brought up a few more times after this in a complaining type of way about his masturbating, to which I expressed that I wasn't sure what he wanted me to say, and he said he wasn't expecting anything really and just wanted me to know. It all made no sense to me. 

So, I guess my question is whether this could constitute as sexual abuse? I feel very -odd- about the entire situation, coupled with some other things I am currently battling with him over, and I'm not really sure what to make of this. I haven't ever experienced something even similar to this situation so I have nothing to compare it to and Google wasn't much help.

Thank you for any responses in advance, any insight is appreciated. ",2024-12-19 04:08:57,2025-03-17 03:03:58,abuse
1grqg8j,Is any of this abusive? Why can't I leave?,io45612,6,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1grqg8j/is_any_of_this_abusive_why_cant_i_leave/,"I have been with my boyfriend for 9 years and am deeply unhappy. I have been for a long time. This year I realized I've been in denial for years that there may be some abuse in my relationship. I am miserable and want to meet a husband and a long term partner who meets the same things. However, there are many things in the way. 1. I can't justify that any of this is actually abuse. I think I'm just being overdramatic. 2. I'm autistic (actually diagnosed) and change really disrupts my life. 3. My sister and I lost my Dad several years ago and I went through a miscarriage at the same time. I'm anticipating going through the same grief from if I breakup with my boyfriend and I just can't do it. 4. What if I regret it or it's the worst mistake I ever make?

Are any of these things abusive or reasons we shouldn't be together?

1.We're not sexually compatible at all. We've haven't any sexual contact of ANY kind in over 3 years now. I have vaginismus and vulvodynia which cause intense pain during sex, but he refuses to try new things at all and even refuses to modify penetration in certain ways to make it less painful. Says he doesn't ""know how."" He refuses to partake in any kind of foreplay. It eventually just became way too painful for me and I set a boundary. I want a healthy fun sexual relationship with someone. He doesn't know that I know he watches cam girls in the bathroom. 

2. When we were first together, he pressured me to drive into an empty office parking lot at night and give him a handjob. I remember being so uncomfy that I almost pushed my face against my window, but I never said no. He has since admitted over text that it was the worst thing he's ever done but that he was a stupid ""horny kid.""

3. I have PTSD from being sexually assaulted my a doctor (3 years into our relationship). At one point, my boyfriend said ""I can't believe you thinking more about this other man than me.""

  
4. I have a lot of medical issues and have had multiple surgeries including an emergency surgery while we've been together. He has never come, except for once, and that one time- I had to beg. Won't come to doctor appointments with me because ""I don't need him there.""

  
5. Gets mad at me when I talk about something more than once because it's ""illogical."" Things he has done included clapping his hands in my face and slamming my car door so hard he damaged it.

  
6. Wants my routine to revolve around him. He refuses to help with housework, even when I had spine surgery and even though I still have a bad spine and can't bend well. He won't help me clean hard to reach places and our apartment is in filth. Part of my stress is actually just the state of our apartment. He also won't pay someone to come help us clean it. He expects me to drive him to work at 11 at night even though he works literally 5 minutes away, because he doesn't drive, even though I work at 7am.  He enforces me doing chores by setting them up for me. Ie. he'll set out cat food and a bowl and remind me to do it, when he could have spent the same amount of energy just putting the food in the bowl and feeding our cat. He'll do this and remind me to feed her when I'm in bed at like 1 am.

7. He constantly gropes me. Like grabs my boobs. He doesn't listen to a word I say about anything and I feel invisible in my home. Then the minute I try to start a stimulating conversation with him he'll make silly faces and grabs my boobs. The one time I stood up for myself he got violent at objects near me and screamed at me and blamed it on my ADHD. Said he would stop and did for a while. Now he's doing it again. 

8. I want to get married. I want to feel like a princess for a day, and I feel like he thinks I don't deserve it.

1horxt1,is this considered abuse? (im a teenager),Creative_Crab4968,16,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1horxt1/is_this_considered_abuse_im_a_teenager/,"hi, im a teenager and i created a burner just for this so that he can't find it or something.  there have been a couple instances where my dad ( twice my size) has hurt me; but i know he loves me yet has never said sorry. he yells a LOT and will threaten to hurt me and my younger brother sometimes but never carries them out and will also threaten to break stuff like our phones or other electronics (he's been doing so since i was really little).

there was an instance where he shoved 7 year old me into a wall when my mom wasn't home because i wouldn't brush my teeth. more recently, last winter, he dragged me off my bed by my hair, then kicked me when i fell onto the floor because i wanted to finish my homework before showering. i did cry and told him to stop because it truly did hurt, especially because when i was kicked my head hit the leg of a chair in my room.
 
im not sure if this is considered serious abuse or something that puts me in danger. i've told my mom yet she won't do anything, so i've come to reddit for this question ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
there have been also MANY instances where he'll insult me/bring me down if i do small things he doesn't agree with, and will belittle me and call me names. stuff like insulting my weight, what i look like, saying i have no friends because of xxx, stuff like that. and i admit that it makes me afraid to do anything that makes me stand out in front of him. i doubt he'll hurt me again but im afraid to tell anyone incase he gets mad

i doubt he means to hurt me and im pretty sure his parents treated him the same way when he was a child. i know he truly does love me, but i also know that he shouldn't threaten to smack me when i make a snide comment",2024-12-29 08:41:50,2025-03-17 03:04:01,abuse
1i13khy,"I pressed charges against abuser, and feel guilty",Money_Instruction_26,15,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1i13khy/i_pressed_charges_against_abuser_and_feel_guilty/,"I am posting because I have this awful feeling inside me every day, and I‚Äôm hoping that someone might help me understand why, or even just the process of writing it down might help.

Two years ago, I ended an abusive relationship. We were only together for about 18 months, and have a 3 year old child. Prior to this, I had a loving relationship for over 10 years and was widowed.

I met him when I was grieving, and at first didn‚Äôt understand what was happening, having never met a person like this before. He is a narcissist/sociopath, and very successfully love bombed me, I fell pregnant, and during my pregnancy everything changed. 

I won‚Äôt go into detail about everything he did to me. Because I would need to write a novel. But in short‚Ä¶ once he realised I had started to see through his charm, and his lies, he turned cold, and then turned into a monster. I was very vulnerable and easily manipulated by him. 
There was not a lot of physical abuse, but he wreaked havoc on my life in every other way imaginable. He manipulated everyone around me, my friends, my colleagues, in a career where I had been respected. He financially, emotionally, and mentally set about destroying me. He was very imaginative and very cruel with the things he did - they were always subtle and left little evidence, but my life life quickly became hell. l lived in terror of him because I could see how dangerous he was, and the more I tried to protect myself, the more obsessed he became with controlling me.

When I finally left him, things got drastically worse. He forced me to keep having sex with him, and if I didn‚Äôt, his favourite punishment, amongst many other things, was to kidnap our son, switch off his phone and disappear for days or a week. He did this over and again for 18 months. This was despite having family court orders in place (I had primary custody, he only had any custody at all because of his lies and manipulation in the family court). He would leave our son in places where he wasn‚Äôt safe at all, with strangers‚Ä¶ I was terrified for his safety every second he was gone, as was my teenage son from my first marriage. Every time he finally bought our son home he would be completely traumatised, with a sort of thousand yard stare. This was agonizing for me to see, I reported to the police every time, but they could do nothing because he was the father. 
He did a lot more, but this punishment was by far the worst for me, and there is honestly so much I wouldn‚Äôt know where to start trying to explain it.

Late last year, after 18 months of his campaign of terror, I tried to really put boundaries up and started refusing to have sex with him.  He came to my house drunk, and raped me in front of our 3 year old son. Our son tried to pull him off the whole time. 

The whole incident was caught clearly on my home security cameras. 
I immediately called the police and gave them the footage. The next few days were a blur of statements, hospital visits. He was arrested and charged with rape and indecent treatment of a child under 12. I have been told he will be sentenced to at least 8 years in jail. Our trial starts next month.

Here is the crazy part. I feel so sad. I feel guilty. I feel sorry for him. For this person whose one single goal in life was to destroy mine. 
I lie in bed at night crying. I feel sad, empty. I‚Äôm crying right now writing this. 
Some part of me understands that he groomed me and manipulated me and controlled me for years, and I understand he committed crimes, the things he did to me and my children were monstrous. 
But I can‚Äôt help feeling bad, feeling sorry for him. It kills me that I feel like this. 
There was no excuse for what he did to me, to my mental health, to my life. He tried to destroy everything, not caring there were two innocent children as collateral.
This man has no excuse - he had a great childhood, he is very attractive, popular, people love him, nothing bad has ever happened to him. But behind closed doors, behind his fake image he shows everyone, there is just nothing there, except cruelty and selfishness and evil. 

The only ‚Äòcrime‚Äô I ever committed to him was breaking up with him when he was abusive and then trying to move on with my life. I tried to coparent, tried to accommodate, tried to do everything right. I don‚Äôt understand why he was so obsessed with destroying me. And now, he has ruined his life.

I‚Äôm glad i went to the police and pressed charges, but I can‚Äôt understand or get rid of the horrible feeling of guilt and sadness. I will go ahead with the trial, and he will be sentenced. Even if I tried to drop charges the police wouldn‚Äôt allow it. Not that I‚Äôm going to. 
But I don‚Äôt feel good about it at all. 

I believe he is still controlling me. There is still some cord tying me to him. I feel so lost, so sad, and I feel like I am irreparably broken and will never find peace.",2025-01-14 10:57:00,2025-03-17 03:04:02,abuse

1j90z9v,healthy mechanisms to stay away from my abusive ex,No-Vegetable-8450,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1j90z9v/healthy_mechanisms_to_stay_away_from_my_abusive_ex/,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm hoping someone could give me a bit of advice. I feel very stuck. I have been in a abusive relationship for about five years now. 


The last year has been the best year I have made a lot of steps forward. Cutting contact a lot of the time for maybe a month, two months at a time but I always end up going back, the cycle usually starts as okay will be friends and then the friendship starts to become possessive, he‚Äôll usually will turn into the person that is abusive, mentally questioning me about everything who I‚Äôm with what I‚Äôm doing, isolating me from having a life outside him things like that. 

The issue that seems to keep me stuck is that I seem to want to still be civilised with him or on talking terms? Or that I feel like I don‚Äôt want him to see me in this bad light? 

I feel like verbally he has always been so hard with accusations on cheating and other guys that I feel the need to be this ‚Äògood girl‚Äô and prove that I‚Äôm not out or with anyone else- this will include us staying in contact and just being friends but him feeling the need to know inner details about my personal life. 

For example, we aren‚Äôt speaking momentarily because I went to see a physio and he flipped the lid because it was a man. 

I can‚Äôt live like that, I won‚Äôt live like that. 
But I really struggle with not reaching out to nearly fix his perception or getting him to understand why I‚Äôm innocent. 

I really hope this resonates with someone, I‚Äôve been in therapy, doing amazing work on myself and know I will come out the other side of this and finally cut the cord. 

I think with this post I‚Äôm really looking for coping mechanisms in the mean time, things to not make me feel awful and keep me from contacting him to ensure that he knows I‚Äôm a ‚Äògood girl‚Äô as such. 


I‚Äôve came such a long way from reactive abuse and the girl I used to be would be so proud, I just feel so stuck on these end parts and trying to fix these bad habits. I‚Äôm nearly 1000% sure he knows what he‚Äôs doing by this silent treatment and accusations because he knows it‚Äôs the only way to reach me.

Thanks for letting me post this and vent. And I really appreciate anything that might give me some help with this. ",2025-03-11 20:38:31,2025-03-17 03:04:04,abuse

After that, he completely unraveled‚Äîshaving his head in a rage, quitting his job, blowing all our money, and putting us into debt until we had to sell our home. His ex-wife was a constant source of stress and conflict, and even after winning, she continued making life difficult.

The Abuse and Escalation

During this time, he became emotionally and verbally abusive‚Äîchasing me around the house, screaming in my face, demanding that I hit him, and then cycling through apologies before doing it all over again. His best friend even stayed with us and told me I should leave but didn‚Äôt want to say too much because they‚Äôre childhood friends.

This isn‚Äôt new behavior. Early in our relationship, I hit him first during an argument while drunk. Police were there for the music being loud and he told me to go into one of the rooms. I said no, he grabbed my arm and i punched him in the face. To stop me he punched me several times, and I briefly lost consciousness. I carried guilt for this and still believe I was at fault. You shouldn‚Äôt hit anyone unless you have to, right? And i despise women who hit men because they know that they can‚Äôt hit them back. I‚Äôm very remorseful and ashamed about it. A year Later, we had a heated argument over something trivial (whether robots can have emotions), and when I tried to walk away, he grabbed me by the neck, threw me on the bed, and choked me.

For years, he told me I was the reason he screamed and that I needed to ‚Äúlearn to shut up.‚Äù He said if I attacked his character (calling him crazy, pointing out overreactions, saying he was a bad friend or a bad person), he would react aggressively. I internalized this and tried to be careful, but no matter what I did, if he was in the mood to rage, he would. He once dragged me across the floor, crouched over me, screaming in my face‚Äîdespite me following every rule he set for how I should respond to his outbursts. I brought this to his attention several times and no explanation. He gave me all these things i better not do because it‚Äôll provoke him and nothing worked? 



In December of last year We moved to a farm for a fresh start, selling our house and getting an RV. I handled the financial mess he created, even had to sue a contractor who ran off with our money, and made the transition happen. Everything outside of us is wonderful here, but inside our marriage, things have gotten worse.

Religious Shift & More Instability

We had converted to Islam four years ago, and it brought a lot of stability. Then suddenly, after moving, he abandoned the faith, started drinking, smoking, and engaging in inappropriate conversations with coworkers. I told him I was uncomfortable, but he dismissed me as controlling. He often takes me with him to hang out. Maybe like 70% of the time I‚Äôm with him and he‚Äôs actively engaging me and making me a part of the socialization. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm sitting on the side. He says people just feel comfortable around us and think we are cool so they just spill their guts which is just not appropriate and i rather not participate because it all sounds like mess. Drama and mess and inappropriate context. 

But before the farm these instances happened -

One night after a fight, he went to the train tracks and said he was going to kill himself. Another time, he choked me because I stayed up late working as an admin for a friend‚Äôs religious YouTube channel. He called me a ‚Äúpiece of sh*t‚Äù for not prioritizing his feelings over that, even though he was asleep when I started working. After that, he checked himself into a mental institution.

His behavior swings between suicidal, homicidal, or being the sweetest, most loving man. He has moments where he‚Äôs completely devoted, then suddenly shuts me out. He has extreme attunement skills, gives me his undivided attention, wants to be around me 24/7.

After we got to the farm,

Over the religious conversation where i brought my concerns to him about the drastic change and what to tell the kids and how uncomfortable i am with feeling like he ripped everything away, he yelled and kicked me and the kids out of the rv. It took me some times to pack and when we got on the road he text saying to comeback and that hes got to start putting the kids first and that we can live together and maybe something will change in the future. So i came back. 

Now last night we go to a neighbors to sit springs the fire and that neighbor and another neighbor want to talk about sexual stuff. In particular one wanted to talk a bit how he was sexually harassed by a girl who just recently moved back and the other neighbor thought it was funny and just egged it on etc. i was just kinda sitting there nervous chuckling and wishing i was dead. I am modest in nature and he knows that and has promised to keep certain boundaries in agreeance with me. But then he decided not to and there‚Äôs no discussion. He did tell them to steer the conversation in another direction and they didn‚Äôt and i know he can‚Äôt control other adults but i see groups around the farm and this one they constantly talks bad about other people and talks about sexual stuff isn‚Äôt the one i war to be a regular member of nor does it align with anything we planned or promised each other and he acts like im just controlling. Maybe he‚Äôs right? Idk. Well we went home and i said nothing and we enjoyed the rest of our night and i was sweet to him just trying tk ans sense of everything ur j was quiet this morning. He said he was going i. Late so he could help around the house. One of those moments where he‚Äôs like the best husband ever and this does happen regularly.  But i was short and kind of melancholy so he jerk asking what wrong and i kept saying i didn‚Äôt wanna talk about it and that it‚Äôs not an emergency or anything.  After i took the laundry to the laundry room we stepped outside and i told him idk if i really want to be at this farm anymore. I‚Äôve earned him about his overly inviting behavior and how we have opportunity to build friendships with people who hold the same values and he‚Äôs slowly but surely pushing us into the drinking, smoking, cussing , vulgar group despite us being invited to a birthday with managers and owners only and not that that makes them good people by they‚Äôre wholesome and have good habits and that‚Äôs what they want. They could‚Äôve been the Janitor, mailman, chef, poop scooper and i would‚Äôve been happy if they all aligned with us on what‚Äôs important and valued family and doing good. Anyways he listened and then said that he tried to steer the conversation but can‚Äôt control that they do. I told him that i get that but it‚Äôs not about this conversation it‚Äôs about boundaries. I don‚Äôt have people coming up to me telling me who they screwed last night because I‚Äôve established boundaries. He says that means he can‚Äôt talk to anyone at all and I‚Äôm controlling him. I tell him i don‚Äôt want to talk anymore and I‚Äôm going to let the kids know I‚Äôm driving him a cross the street and he says ‚Äúwe already told them, you remember all that‚Äôs hit but can‚Äôt remember that we told them‚Äù

So i get pissed because he does this when the conversion isn‚Äôt going in his favor. He starts jabbing at me so i tell him that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs doing right now ant to stop and he starts yelling and escalating and telling me to just drop him off because he‚Äôs done. So now im emotional and telling him im too old for this shit anymore. And he tells me I‚Äôm crazy and to pull over and let him out of the car on the side of the highway and i say no there‚Äôs 2 semi trucks behind us and he grabs the steering wheel and out his foot in the driver area to press the break. I let him out and drive off then i stop and call him and tell him he better get back in the car because he‚Äôs gonna hear me and that he doesn‚Äôt shit every time. He gets the spotlight off the issue and then just fights with me so he gets in the car and i yell at him and say I‚Äôm tired of this cycle and i didn‚Äôt even want to talk because i knew it would end this way and i said he didn‚Äôt do what he should to avoid boundaries and at that moment he screamed to let him out because im not recognizing that he said to steer the conversation which was him establishing a boundary that the neighbors just didn‚Äôt respect.
He choked me and punched me in the face, grabbed the steering wheel, put his foot down in the driver pedal area. And i called 911. A manger from his job pulled up to see if we were ok and he told them i was holding him hostage and i told him that he punched  me in my face. I‚Äôve never called 911 before despite all the previous instances. 
I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs relevant anymore. I‚Äôm so exhausted and have been for a long time.  

Every time this happens i feel immediate guilt and wish i had said nothing or said the right things. I almost always crumble first. He‚Äôs been my best friend for so long and in such a derp level that i just feel like i can‚Äôt breathe if we are at odds.

He has had a past of alcoholism and I caught him drunk and he terrorized me and our 8 week old baby. He smashed my computer when i tried to reach someone for help and hid my phone. He took our baby from me and was holding him in scary ways and wouldn't give him back to me. I called 911 and the police arrested him and are charging him with ""wrongs to a minor"" ""destruction of property"" and ""disturbance of the peace"". He was released from jail and his staying with his brother and the state has a protection probation on him so he can't have access to me or our baby until his case is over.

I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with something like this. This is the first time he scared me, and his behavior taking our baby and trying to scare me with him (he left him on the couch face down when i was trying to call 911 from the other room). I'm very scared being a single mom but I make good money and have one month left of maternity leave before I have to figure out childcare. My gut tells me to run for the hills but any and all advice navigating DV with such a young baby would be appreciated.

For reference I have tried to get him to be sober for years. I left him while I was pregnant and he went to a 30 day outpatient program but has been drinking in secret since I believe. ",2025-03-06 12:28:08,2025-03-17 03:04:12,violence

But for most of my life, I didn‚Äôt know we could challenge the ruling of her death. In 1990, my mother, Dawn Caraveo, was found dead under suspicious circumstances. Despite her history of severe domestic violence, multiple hospitalizations, and forensic red flags, her death was ruled a suicide‚Äîwith no real investigation.

In 2003, my sister tried to get the case reopened, but she was ignored. Last year, I started pushing again, and Indiana State Police have finally reopened the case. But no family should have to fight this long just to be heard.

I‚Äôm now advocating for legislative reforms to prevent other families from going through this. If you believe in holding law enforcement accountable for misclassified deaths and ensuring real investigations into suspicious suicides, I‚Äôd love your support.

1ivwjaw,First sign of domestic violence,Specific_Device_269,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ivwjaw/first_sign_of_domestic_violence/,"I (19F) have been in a relationship with a man (26M) for about a year now. The last 6 months have been hell for me. 

So I‚Äôll give you some insight into what‚Äôs been going on:
I met him at the gym. He was the instructor of my class (we are both instructors, but I was participating that day.) 
we got to talking after classes for hours, and he generally just made me feel warm inside, but I wasn‚Äôt necessarily looking for a relationship with him.
We ended up getting unbelievably drunk together one night. We were trying to get home, but were so drunk we ended up sitting at a bus stop and just‚Ä¶ laughing. 
In the middle of our laughter he tried to kiss me. I pulled away, more than once because I didn‚Äôt really want a relationship with him, but eventually I gave in and kissed him back.
We went back to his flat. We didn‚Äôt have sex, he was respectful; we both stayed fully clothed.
After that we began to grow closer and closer, and as I came round to the idea of dating him, he said to me when we were sitting on the boot of my car after a class:
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really want anyone to know about us‚Äù
I brushed it off as nothing, little did I know this would be significant a year down the line.

Things were going well (as it seemed, despite him wanting to keep ‚Äúus‚Äù secret.) I found out that he was living in a flat owned by his mum and was paying no rent, which is odd. 
His mum needed money so had to sell the flat, meaning he had to move out, but he could only go and live with her (which was downstairs from the flat we were in before!!) I stayed there most nights, even though his mum was there, I stayed there as I wanted to be with him.

We would be intimate still, but my heart wasn‚Äôt 100% feeling him yet (I didn‚Äôt want to rip his clothes off.) 
I also didn‚Äôt feel very comfortable with him (which becomes more significant later on).

There was no lock on the bathroom door, and one time I was on the toilet (he knew this) but decided to come in anyway even though we hadn‚Äôt known each other that long.
I said in a relatively harsh tone ‚Äúcan you get out?! I just want some fucking privacy‚Äù
I can‚Äôt remember exactly what he said, but he was very angry about my ‚Äúreaction‚Äù
I ended up leaving, then he rang me to ask why I ‚Äúreacted‚Äù in that way to which I told him I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable and I like privacy.
As we were speaking, I could hear him punching pillows on the other end of the phone. This was the first sign of violence.

We eventually got over this incident, and went on holidays together, went for meals out and were still having a good time

On one of the holidays we went on, it all went badly wrong. We were drinking again, we were both drunk, but he ended up getting alcohol poisoning. 
I tried to get him back to the hotel room but he couldn‚Äôt walk and was just throwing up in a bush. It was freezing out, and I could see that his lips were turning a blueish colour. So I called an ambulance. I didn‚Äôt even know if the ambulance people were coming or not, so I took matters into my own hands. I lifted him up (as I‚Äôm quite a strong woman lol) and I literally carried him back to the hotel. On the way to the hotel, with very slurred words he said some nasty things to me that upset me too much to repeat. 
But me being the mug I am got him back to the hotel and nursed him. His alcohol poisoning continued to get worse to which he went from saying slurred sentences to barely being able to speak at all, all he was doing was throwing up. I made sure he sat up, I held him up as he was being sick so he wouldn‚Äôt choke, rubbed his back (even though it was his own fault he got like that) and made sure he was warm (as he felt stone cold to touch.) he was sick on me, which is a phobia of mine but I didn‚Äôt care, I just wanted him to be ok. 
I don‚Äôt know how but the ambulance worked out where we were, and they came in to save him. They said he needed to go to the hospital immediately as was suffering with mild hypothermia that could be life threatening. I went in the ambulance and sat up with him all night in the hospital. 
The morning after came.
He acted like he didn‚Äôt even remember what he had said to me. Maybe he didn‚Äôt remember. But I feel like he didn‚Äôt show any remorse for what he had said and done last night. 
I told him that he had said some awful things, and that I wanted to go home. He begged me to stay - I refused, after I discovered the way he really felt about me.  
I went home and tried to remove him from my life. we didn‚Äôt speak for weeks. He still asked for the money for my half of the holiday.

I told a friend of mine about what had happened and what he had said, she convinced him to apologise with a gesture.
He did. Kind of.
He bought me flowers, chocolate and a toy for my dog, and just like that, being the mug I am, I let him back into my life, and I regret it.

Anyway. We started getting closer again. I was hurt, about what he said to me as I always thought that the truth comes out when you‚Äôre drunk. But we started getting closer again, and his dad was buying him a flat that he could ‚Äúrent‚Äù off him. He suggested that we move in together. I wasn‚Äôt convinced, but he said, you can come and live with me, and just pay half the bills, not the rent as I know you have some debt (I did).
I moved in (not because I was in debt, as I was gradually paying it off when I was in my old place,) but because I enjoyed spending time with him
We moved in.
But moving in was hell.
You see, he has a lot of crap. He is a crystal collector, but had hundreds of them. I personally took hours bubble wrapping all his things while he sat and moaned at his mum, reminding her not to touch anything. 
He didn‚Äôt seem grateful enough for how much time I had just spent bubble wrapping his shit, but I let that slide, as I put it down to him just being stressed about moving.
Then when we were actually moving things into the flat, he would say nasty comments to me for no reason at all. Eg when I was helping him move a crystal up to the flat he would say things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre actually weaker than I thought you were‚Äù 
And ‚Äúyou‚Äôre supposed to be strong aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù
Which I did let slide, I told him I didn‚Äôt like being spoken to like that to which he later responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve been saying all those horrible things to you, I think I‚Äôm probably stressed.‚Äù 
Again I let it go, but the cracks had started to show.
He continued to say things that weren‚Äôt nice
Such as ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like your hair like that‚Äù when I had been sweating moving shit up the stairs.
And later in general conversation he says ‚Äúif I could change anything about you I would probably make you a bit lighter‚Äù which hurt me deeply as I am a recovered anorexic.
I still forgave him and put it down to his ‚Äústress‚Äù of moving.

Then a few days after all this, he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really want to be exclusive with you, is that ok?‚Äù
Which deeply hurt me as we were months into our relationship. 

Following this, there was another incident. We  were out drinking again. He came later, I was already drunk when he got there. Some old work colleagues asked me if I wanted to go to the pub. Drunk me said yeah sure reunion! He came with me, and left shortly after we got there, I don‚Äôt even remember him saying bye. 
The night went on, but it got to the point where I just wanted to go home, as was drunk. I realised I had forgotten my keys so just said fuck it I‚Äôll stay out tonight. 
I looked nice that night and was getting a lot of male attention (but I didn‚Äôt want it, I only wanted him.) 
one of my colleagues took me to the side as could see I was getting overwhelmed in my drunk state and said ‚Äúshould we go back to my mums house? You can sleep on the sofa.‚Äù
I heard ‚Äúmums house‚Äù and I thought yeah that‚Äôs safe
So I went. I trusted this guy as he had never seemed like a bad guy to me. He did everything he said. He said you have my bed and I‚Äôll have the sofa. I said fine. Was tired by then. We both went to sleep. It wasn‚Äôt until early hours of the morning when he woke me up, then thought he would try something. He got in the bed with me, but I was very assertive (drunk or not) and I said NO don‚Äôt touch me. He backed off and went back to the sofa. That was it. I woke up in the morning, went home, got the spare key off my sister and everything went back to normal 

He found out about this, and saw this as ‚Äúcheating‚Äù on him even though he had literally JUST told me he wanted to see other people. And I didn‚Äôt even do anything!!!

Ok then that was that. We moved on from it, but I could tell he was different.

Then the next thing that happened. My niece came over and was talking to me a lot about boys (she talks quite crudely to be honest) then, she said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs this picture going around of this dick, we don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs real or not because it looks like plasticine, do you want to see‚Äù 
I said ‚Äúgo on then‚Äù just humouring her
He went mad, and left the flat for 2 hours or so. Just saying he wanted to go for a drive to clear his head 
I saw his car leave, then after he wasn‚Äôt back for an hour, I assumed he was sleeping with someone else, as I had no idea what I could‚Äôve done which could‚Äôve made him so angry. So then I got angry that he could just leave, and sleep with someone like that 
I chatted a lot of shit about him 
Even though it wasn‚Äôt true, I just said that he was bad in bed and that I was missing how passionate my exes were.   
I then found out that later he had driven round the block to make me think he had left but was actually outside listening to our conversation and heard everything. This isn‚Äôt normal is it?

He was funny with me for days. I asked him to get me some chicken from the shops, and he said ‚Äúok well can you give me the ¬£1.95 that I payed for the chicken then?‚Äù 
And I‚Äôm not used to that level of tightness
He later admitted that he was listening through the window and that‚Äôs why he was so angry and ‚Äúfunny‚Äù with me

Every time we had sex he went soft
But eventually we got over it. We started having sex again, but he was different 
He wouldn‚Äôt take me out for dinner anymore 
He was no longer affectionate with me
He never told me he loved me 

I also found out that he audio recorded the flat to see if I was talking about him on the phone. He heard me speaking to my mum about being unhappy. I was fuming. Surely this is a breach of human rights, surveillance without permission. But he manipulated me to get his own way. I forgave him again. 

Things still weren‚Äôt good between us. He wasn‚Äôt showing me any love or affection. 
So I was constantly begging him to love me, and practically telling him how I wanted to be loved 
Nothing worked. 

He started asking me to pay half for everything 
And would say things like ‚Äúare you alright to get this one because I bought you (X) earlier‚Äù

Then he kept fucking up over and over again. For example
Going out for the whole day and turning his phone off when we were supposed to be going out that evening 

Refusing to communicate with me:
Where he was, what he was doing, he seemed to think that it wasn‚Äôt important if he was going to be in a different place to where he said he would be, for hours
We had so many arguments about this
‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you just drop me a message to tell me what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù

Then every time he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be better, I‚Äôll communicate‚Äù
And again and again, he doesn‚Äôt care enough to communicate.

We started arguing over everything. Examples

I personally like eating dinner with my partner, so I said, can you please not eat dominoes for lunch, so we can have some dinner together
But probably 100 times he has thought, fuck it
I‚Äôm doing what I want (= eating Domino‚Äôs meaning no appetite for dinner, hence I‚Äôm eating on my own again.) he never listened and always said ‚Äúyou not wanting to eat on your own is a you problem‚Äù

He has never introduced me to people before as his girlfriend. In fact he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to introduce you to (person) by the way‚Äù
And previously he has said that he doesn‚Äôt want to be seen with me as he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want people knowing his business‚Äù

He decided he wanted to go out with his friends every week (even though I work probably 20+ hours more than him every week, and he could go out with his friends when I am at work, but he wants to go out with his friends in the evening) which frustrates me because I can‚Äôt understand why he would choose to see his friends in ‚Äúour time‚Äù when we have a limited amount of hours in the week together.

He doesn‚Äôt work early in the morning now, as wants to prioritise his sleep, yet watches TV up until early hours of the morning, not caring if it‚Äôs keeping me up.
Recently, also he has been telling me when it‚Äôs time for me to go to bed so he can watch his program

He refuses to compromise or make an effort for me
He won‚Äôt buy me anything
He never tells me I‚Äôm beautiful, or that he loves me (unless he wants a blow job)
He refuses to take me out to dinner
and he repeats the things he says sorry for, time and time again.
He doesn‚Äôt even say hello to me when I come through the door, even though I have actually asked him to acknowledge me as I come home from work. 

Also, I applied for a job, a promotion. He found out I applied then made a phone call asking about the job. Then he said ‚Äúat the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt matter, the best person will get the job‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt care about me. Like when I‚Äôm ill or having really bad period pains, he just expects me to be normal. And also I recently found out that I have a heart condition which causes chest pain, dizziness and blackouts which is worse when I‚Äôm stressed, but he doesn‚Äôt care about that.

Also he chooses to workout (do classes) in the evenings rather than in the day when he has extra time, which is time that we could be spending together (considering the limited number of hours we have in the week together.) he says he wants to do the class to keep fit. I say why can‚Äôt you just do a different workout in your free time during the day. He says no, he wants to do a class. (I go to the gym in my lunch break.) this makes me think he doesn‚Äôt even want to spend time with me.

He prioritises his friends, family, rugby, work and food over me, and that has been displayed to me multiple times, and it hurts. 

He is very into rugby, and if rugby was on, he would completely ignore me - wouldn‚Äôt say a single word. Today, I actually bought him a load of stuff from the shop, then as rugby was on, I started trying to show him what I had bought him (trying to be nice), he didn‚Äôt even look at me or acknowledge that I had most bought him loads of things he said he wanted. I was frustrated. I said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even care I‚Äôm here do you‚Äù he did not respond. Then under my breath I said ‚ÄúI hope England lose.‚Äù he was angry I had said that. After England won I said ‚Äúthere you go England won‚Äù he STILL wouldn‚Äôt speak to me. I said ‚Äúwhy are you not speaking to me‚Äù then he responded ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to speak to someone who says stuff like that‚Äù I said ‚Äústuff like what?‚Äù He said ‚Äúwell, you said you want England to lose‚Äù I said ‚Äúyeah, and?‚Äù Then he called me a bitch. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to my mums‚Äù he said go on then, and I started getting my stuff together (all of the stuff out of the fridge I had just bought him.) I slammed the fridge door shut, then he poured all the milk I had just bought down the sink. I poured a pot noodle on the side, to which he grabbed me and threw me at the wall. Then when I stood up, he pushed me again. I knew he was violent. From the moment he started punching those pillows. I knew it. I said to him at the start. What if those pillows become my face? He said it would never happen but today he hurt me. Then he blamed me for it 
He said ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have done that if you hadn‚Äôt slammed the fridge‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is your fault‚Äù
To which I had a panic attack after he attacked me, then left, to go to my mums
Can I please have your opinions about this whole situation?

He never lost a bit of sleep or cared I feel. I could be in tears next to him and he would fall asleep. We could be having a deep conversation about fixing us, and he would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just getting in the shower‚Äù or change the subject. 

At the start of our relationship, he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve not treated my ex girlfriends well in the past. I want to be different this time‚Äù

I wish I had ran

1ezq1c2,Is this domestic violence? ,Kiirjava,18,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ezq1c2/is_this_domestic_violence/,"My (36 F) partner (38 M)  and I have been together for 4 years. Throughout the relationship he's had anger issues where once every 4 months or so when his patience is very low or when he's really tired and we get into an argument he because very violent and starts screaming at the top of his lungs, hitting himself, nearby furniture, walls and throwing whatever he can find across the room. Please note he has never laid a finger on me. 
If we happen to be driving when that happens he starts driving erratically making me scared for my life.

--> Fast forward to today, I am currently 4 months pregnant with a child that he says he has wanted all his life, I made him swear that he would control his outbursts especially when I'm pregnant as they terrify me...
Well the other day we got into an argument and I was particularly hormonal and snappy (not proud of it but you know... Bitchy pregnant woman vibe), and he lost it. He started screaming like I've never heard him scream, he ripped off the t-shirt he had on with his bare hands reaping it to pieces, threw a bar stool across the living room, broke my flower pots and starting hitting the walls repeatedly. I was so scared I was shaking like a leaf and ran into the bathroom to lock myself in as I was scared he would hurt me.

He now tells me that I started it, and that everybody has their limits, but that ""I know him"" and that I should know he would never hurt me directly. 
I feel completely heartbroken that he would act so violently and scare me like this when I'm pregnant with his child. I told him I'm pretty sure this counts as domestic violence and abuse, and he says that I'm the abuser since I started it, and it's just a normal couple ""argue"" that everybody goes through. 
I'm pregnant, I'm scared, I feel betrayed and gaslighted. Need an external view on this, is this bad? Is this domestic violence?

Thank you so much...

**TLDR: My (36F) partner (38M) screams, hits and breaks things when angry (but not me directly) he tells me it's not abuse. Not sure what to do and I'm now 4 months pregnant and scared. ",2024-08-23 22:42:11,2025-03-17 03:04:27,violence
1eqw4cs,Has Anyone Healed a Relationship from Domestic Violence Fueled by Alcohol?,punkwillneverdie,14,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1eqw4cs/has_anyone_healed_a_relationship_from_domestic/,"So sorry this is long, but advice is very much appreciated. It‚Äôs pretty hard to put everything into words so it might sound kinda monotone.

I‚Äôm 24F and he‚Äôs 30M. We met at 22 and 28.

I have been with my boyfriend for a little over 1 year. We lived together for about the same amount of time. We‚Äôve both heavily abused alcohol for almost this whole time.However,  I‚Äôve been scaling way back for a long time and these days, if i do have a drink, i keep it to 1 drink.

The issues started out small, and I understood they came from the position of drunk trauma (super abusive/negligent household, foster care, abandonment issues). He‚Äôs never done anything or said anything when he was sober. But I was a party girl bartender and when I met him at the bar I worked at, he had just started drinking again.

Long story short, the past few months have been hell. We‚Äôve been broken up for a month now because we went on a birthday vacation in July. Our birthdays are 5 days apart and this is the second birthday we‚Äôve had together, so we went about 3 hours away to celebrate. My mom told me not to go because nobody wants to drive out there to pick me up if something goes down.

The first day of the trip was amazing, we had such a great night. But the next day, he just got so incredibly drunk. He started acting like a completely different person and he ended up beating me up pretty bad in the hotel room, he even dragged me by my hair out the door and tried to lock me out. I had a bruise on my face and bruises all over my body.

But the worst part was when he choked me out until i passed out. I remember waking up and seeing his face and feeling confused, but peaceful like ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just him i love him‚Äù and then the memory of what just happened all came rushing back and i had a panic attack. And the whole night he was just going off telling me that i‚Äôm a piece of shit, i‚Äôm fat, im too hairy, im the ugliest bitch he‚Äôs ever talked to. He was so drunk and doesn‚Äôt even remember that night. After he fell asleep, I ended up packing my shit and calling my dad to come pick me up at 4 in the morning. Which he did and i‚Äôm so thankful i have a support system.

Ive always hated coming home to him being drunk because I NEVER know what I‚Äôm walking into. Like sometimes he‚Äôs the sweetest telling me he loves me so much, and other times it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs possessed and he says/does the worst shit. Like, he‚Äôs kicked me out of the car and made me walk home (only like half a mile but he would NEVER do that sober and there was no catalyst for it). He‚Äôs kicked me out of the house in the middle of the night multiple times. He‚Äôs spit on me. etc,etc i could go on forever. 

When he‚Äôs sober, everything is completely different. He‚Äôs kind and caring and compassionate and while he‚Äôs not the most even tempered, he would never hit me or say the evil shit he said. It‚Äôs just so confusing. When he‚Äôs sober he makes me feel like what we have is real. And when he‚Äôs drunk I question everything.

After that night, we‚Äôve been broken up for about a month because i‚Äôm tired of feeling so low and so self conscious. But of course the morning after i left the hotel, he called me 10 times asking where i am and what happened. Because he literally blacks out and doesn‚Äôt remember. 

Against the advice of literally everyone, last week I agreed to see him for dinner and get some closure. Because for some reason i‚Äôm hella attached to him and i feel like i love him.

He hasn‚Äôt had a drink since that night on vacation. He definitely feels horrible about what happened. I‚Äôm close with his family and they‚Äôre all supportive of me as well and they even tried to convince me to report him to the police when it happened. 

he said he chooses me and his happiness over alcohol and he never wants to put us in that situation again. To my traumatized head, it seems sincere. But there‚Äôs always this feeling wondering if he can be abusive while sober too, because it‚Äôs how his brain is wired or if he‚Äôs chasing some kind of dopamine or seratonin spike. Being sober to an addict can be SO BORING (i am living proof) and they look for excitement.

But my whole question is, has anyone healed a relationship where alcohol, mixed with past trauma, was the main trigger for it? Do those drunk words really equate to sober thoughts? Is his one month of sobriety enough to think he might really change? He seems super sincere but honestly, my whole family completely hates him after everything he‚Äôs done and I just don‚Äôt want to waste anymore time. I unfortunately do absolutely love him, but that could be my own trauma.


I‚Äôve been in abusive relationships my whole life so I guess I‚Äôm just looking for clarity.

The last one that finally called me told me I was ineligible because there was no direct physical abuse. They asked 1 vague screening question and I answered it wrong and they said we can‚Äôt help you. I protested that I was referred to them because my relationship was too abusive for another center. That center has said I need your wraparound services because of my disability. This center said, no we help women who are at serious risk of being murdered soon‚Äîif that‚Äôs not you, we can‚Äôt help you. I was so devastated I couldn‚Äôt say anything. 


I‚Äôm disabled and largely bedbound/housebound. My partner is too smart and has too much to loose to hit me. But as a caregiver and financial provider, they instead put me in situations of incredible risk and negligence.  I‚Äôve had to be hospitalized with serious injuries because of it. More often it‚Äôs things like they‚Äôll set me up to run completely out of medications that are dangerous for me to stop. I would argue that this is physical abuse even if they aren‚Äôt touching me, considering my vulnerable status. Just like APS can get involved when elders are being abused without being hit. 

The normal every day stuff is my partner uses money to control me and deny me access to medical care. They bully, belittle, harass, shame, and insult me. They don‚Äôt stop when I say stop in sex. They tell me about violent sexual fantasies of hurting me. And on and on. This is a very powerful, well known, vindictive person, and I am afraid to do anything to confront them directly. I have to get out quietly, without accusing them of anything.

It was really upsetting to tell someone all the ways I am at risk and have them tell me it‚Äôs not enough for me to deserve help.

Because of my disability and medical problems, I don‚Äôt have hotline level challenges for getting out. I don‚Äôt think I could even medically stay in a shelter. I‚Äôm not sure what to do",2025-02-05 20:20:48,2025-03-17 03:04:32,violence
1co0ute,Scared to get an abortion after domestic violence,Comfortable_Wear7986,22,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1co0ute/scared_to_get_an_abortion_after_domestic_violence/,"My partner and I were together for three years he was a recovering addict and recently out of prison but we had been friends when we were younger and just fell in love very quickly and moved in together.

It‚Äôs been hard but we have built a beautiful life together that I just am finding it so difficult to let go of. He has been emotionally a sick for awhile getting really angry and loud that I don‚Äôt clean enough or that I am forgetful of certain things. Sometimes he drives really crazy in the car and it scares me and when he gets mad he will give me the silent treatment or go on hunger strikes for days until I‚Äôm so worried I just try to comfort him. Usually we makeup by having sex.

Over the last month it has started to escalate. On March 30 I didn‚Äôt squeeze the soap out of the sponge and he pushed me and shoved me and slapped me, I left immediately and drove around after a few hours I went home to see if he was calmed down and he wrecked my entire room. He said he would have to start smacking me to get me to listen if that was the only way. I was scared I tried to tell my best friend but I lost my nerve by the time we met up and he had started lovebombing me and being wonderful again.

Two weeks ago it got worse, I accidentally left ground Turkey out over night and he got really mad. He took my phone and locked me in my room with him in it blocking the door. I thought I could talk him down because I really needed to go to work but I couldn‚Äôt. I tried to scream and he choked me and threw me on the bed. I kicked him in the balls and tried to go for the door but he pushed me to the ground and strangled me I‚Äôm not sure if I passed out I can‚Äôt remember anymore what happened but eventually i was up and free and I tried to leave the house. He wouldn‚Äôt let me and instead took my phone and my laptop and my keys and said he was going to go overdose.

When he left I ran to my office where my iPad was an called my sister. My friend got me and brought me to her house and we called the police. They arrested him and he spent the weekend in jail.
He got out the following Monday the case was dropped because the police said my bruises and popped blood vessels weren‚Äôt bad enough and I don‚Äôt have enough evidence.

When he got out he went to our neighbors house and they took him in and tried to help him by putting him on a train to NorCal. I was doing good for a week until Monday I realized the date and took a pregnancy test.

We had always talked about having kids and had been trying and I couldn‚Äôt believe it, I‚Äôm 33 and am worried I won‚Äôt have another chance to be a mom but I don‚Äôt want to bring kids into this toxic environment or be tied to him forever.

I flipped out and I called him I was in Shock and I was so scared. He answered and I immediately regretted it as he tried to manipulate and get me to drop restraining order.

I‚Äôve told my best friend and she told me if I have this baby she won‚Äôt be in my life anymore and I really don‚Äôt want to lose her.

I just told my sister and my parents and they all want me to get an abortion too.

My ex 12 years ago was abusive; physically, mentally & sexually. I took our baby @ 9 months old and fled. 
Over the course of 12 years he's reached out & I've given him chances to see his daughter (when she was 4yo, 6yo, & 9y/o).
Him reaching out never amounts to much, he'll have the opportunity to see or talk to her on the phone. Then the next day goes back to getting high & going on stints to state prison. 

Shes now 12 years old. And as the pattern predicts, he's resurfaced. Only now he knows exactly where we live & has filed for custody. 

How do I navigate this? I'm tired of pretending it's water under the bridge & won't tolerate it now that I've matured and become a 32-year old adult & mother. I'm not the 18yo young girl he'd use as a punching bag with no support system & nowhere to go. 

I'm afraid for my daughter. His rage is explosive. He knows no limits and goes into blackouts. She also, doesn't know him and isn't interested. 

He has charges against him for assaulting me more than once. He's been in jail for it. He physically abused me every month for over 2 years. 


I need support because I'm too lenient. I'm so forgiving it's frustrating. But I have a daughter to protect from the abuse I endured. 

I always fall for his ""I'm sorry, I love you"" line. But I can't fall for it this time. I have no intention of going back after 12 years. But how do I get a backbone in this courtroom custody battle to keep my daughter away from him too?",2025-02-10 23:21:08,2025-03-17 03:05:35,violence

Maybe it‚Äôs envy‚Äîseeing mothers with baby showers, surrounded by family and security. I had none of that. I was under threat of violence just for telling my family I was pregnant.

My son was born early due to the overwhelming stress, and we spent nearly two weeks in the NICU. Thankfully, the hospital had a room for mothers with NICU babies, so I didn‚Äôt have to leave his side. But I was completely alone for most of it, until the final few days. I barely slept during that time‚ÄîI was constantly pumping, eating, doing skin-to-skin contact, and learning how to breastfeed. I had almost no one in my corner.

Postpartum wasn‚Äôt any better. The abuse continued, and my son was used as a pawn to control me. My now ex- boyfriend would dress him in his snowsuit and threaten to leave with him in below-freezing temperatures. My son would start screaming, and the sound would trigger my milk to flow, making my breasts ache unbearably. It was relentless‚Äîso much pain, so much trauma.

My shelter is closing on June 30 because LAHSA pulled their grant due to fraud. Instead of rehousing us, they‚Äôre just telling us to ‚Äúget income‚Äù to qualify for a PATH subsidy. Originally, we were told the subsidy would cover the deposit and part of the rent for the first year, tapering off gradually. Now, they‚Äôre only covering the deposit.

I was laid off while at the shelter and went on General Relief (GR) as advised by my case manager. But now she‚Äôs giving me the runaround, and since my GR is ending soon, I no longer qualify for housing assistance through it.

I‚Äôve been in the shelter for almost a year, and I‚Äôm beyond my breaking point‚Äîmentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I don‚Äôt feel safe here. I even had to issue a cease-and-desist to the main site coordinator for verbally assaulting and harassing me. I‚Äôve never been homeless before; I‚Äôm here because I‚Äôm fleeing domestic violence.

Recently, I got an offer for a fully remote state job‚Äîmy dream job. I‚Äôve been applying for months, and this is the only offer I‚Äôve received. But I have nowhere to set up an office, store paperwork, or hang professional clothes for video calls. The department hasn‚Äôt confirmed whether I need a hardline internet connection either. My car is literally my only space.

Now, my case manager suddenly tells me LAHSA has a housing program for people with mental health diagnoses. I got documentation from my therapist confirming PTSD and depression, plus verification of my physical disability. She says this should make me eligible, but she doesn‚Äôt know when LAHSA will get back to me. I‚Äôve been here for a year‚Äîwhy is she just now telling me about this when she‚Äôs known I‚Äôm fleeing domestic violence?

PATH is income-based, so I don‚Äôt qualify until I start working. I filed a grievance with LAHSA about the shelter closing with no rehousing plan, and they were shocked. They said it‚Äôs against their policy to exit people without a plan. The person I spoke to said she‚Äôd look into it, but I haven‚Äôt heard anything since. Apparently, the shelter was supposed to find a new grant, not shut down entirely.

When I tried to push for answers, the site coordinator basically mocked me and told me I should be ‚Äúlooking for housing.‚Äù How am I supposed to do that when they withhold info about internal programs? I also went to the Department of Mental Health for help, and they told me they don‚Äôt do housing‚Äîyet people from my shelter have gotten apartments through them, with rent covered and Section 8 vouchers, even though they weren‚Äôt fleeing DV or disabled.

For some context I'm 24M and partner 25M. We've been together for little under 5yrs. He found a text on my spam instagram to a straight guy I went to hs with that said ""hey"" nothing more nothing less. Was it the smartest idea no, I know fully understand that. However my partner had been texting and talking with another gay man at his work in secretly which I found out about on multiple occasions, it took time and a lot of heartache but I truly was able to forgive and move on and never mention it. But this man olds a grudge and never moves past things, he til this day brings up fights from the first month of dating. To make a long story short, I wanted to take a moment to share something important about my life. I know some may view me as a ‚Äúcheater‚Äù and feel I don‚Äôt deserve kindness, but I hope you can hear my story. I am a survivor of domestic abuse, and my partner has physically harmed me on two occasions.

After the first incident, he sought help and entered therapy, and I chose to stay with him because I began to see positive changes. However, the last incident occurred during a night of heavy drinking when he expressed a desire to join his late father. In a moment of desperation, I reached for the beer in his hand, and he violently slapped me to the ground, causing me to hit my head.

In fear for both of our lives, I called 911 but hung up as he grabbed his gun and began to make threatening remarks. I then contacted the veterans crisis line, knowing that having the police involved could lead to tragic outcomes. Unfortunately, they could not assist since he had already left the apartment.

I share this not for sympathy but to express the complexity of domestic situations. It‚Äôs crucial to understand that there are often two sides to every story. Thank you for taking the time to listen.

I still love this man but I don't know if anything is still worth saving in this relationship. I found out the same day he decided to ""break things off"" which was Valentine's Day night he added the guy he works with back on instagram and started texting him.",2025-02-25 17:20:45,2025-03-17 03:05:43,violence

I‚Äôve been doing this even though I know it doesn‚Äôt work because he will fallow me and to me it feels like he pokes at me till I end up responding in an aggressive manner(I have videos of this) On Saturday I wanted to go visit my mom but he was acting weird so I ended up not going so it wouldn‚Äôt cause a fight.

My husband and I have been separated for almost 6 months already (I‚Äôm living at home with my parents because I have physical disabilities). I‚Äôm 21, he‚Äôs 22 and we got married at 18 (terrible idea, I know), and we‚Äôve been together for about 5 and 1/2 years now. 
I left because he showed the signs of ‚Äúanger issues‚Äù that had led up to him hitting me the first time over two years ago (the second winter of our marriage). The thing about those times was, he never hit me hard. When he slapped me/hit me, it was lightly over the head in the context of ‚Äúwhy did you do/think that?‚Äù When I was struggling with thoughts of SH/other mental health issues. The other issues were that he didn‚Äôt make sure there was food in our home when I was bedbound for several months (post-covid syndrome is so awful), and that he refused to share his banking information or debit cards down to not even letting me know if the bills were paid. 
He‚Äôs been in therapy now for a few months and is on a medication for his mental health and seems to really be recognizing his issues (including bringing up specific things that he had done to hurt me, and ways he plans to resolve them), and he‚Äôs mentioned a few local couples therapists he would like to try together once he‚Äôs adjusted a bit more. He‚Äôs also going to take a class so that he can get into a better field so that he can support us better (it‚Äôs already paid for, he‚Äôs taking the class in April). 
I guess I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôve blown this out of proportion? Was this DV/abuse? Is it possible that he really is coming around and that things will be different or do I need to plan for a divorce? A lot of times I wonder if these mistakes that he‚Äôs made are due to the ways he was raised and being so young‚Ä¶his dad was AWFUL to his mom and I think recognizing that recently has definitely changed something in him. 
(I‚Äôm also taking steps to have my own income. Post covid is in my chart along with other issues so I should be able to get on SSI and then I‚Äôm hoping to finish my associates degree [COVID ruined that for me, too lol], and if I can get some improvement in my health I might be able to work from home in the future)",2025-02-18 01:35:40,2025-03-17 03:05:45,violence

**The cycle between the good and bad moments got shorter.** One day, he was being nice, and literally two days later, he grabbed my jaw and shoved me to the ground during another ridicolous argument.

I ended up locking myself in my room after that, and he wouldn‚Äôt leave for an hour, even though I kept texting him to go. He even took my phone at one point and dared me to call the police.

I am so scared.
I left on Saturday and I am safe.
Sunday I reported him. The police said they will inform him over the course of the week about the report.
Part of me is scared, what he will do.
90% of the stuff in the apartment is mine, yes, it's replaceable, but I have a feeling he will make my life as difficult as he can from now on.
To leave the apartment we both have to sign the termination. My landlord knows everything.
And part of me feels so guilty. We were together 5 years, and I don't recognise the sweet guy I met over 10 years ago.
Why do I feel guilty? Maybe because I still see the good in him, but was there ever any good in him? He manipulated and lied to me the whole relationship, I paid everything for him, he still owes me ~6000‚Ç¨. He has 0‚Ç¨ to his name because I found out the bank claims almost everything as soon as he gets paid. He is known to the police, all this time I had no idea and found out now.
I feel so empty, it's like a nightmare I can't wake up from...
I feel guilty, others went through much worse and I keep thinking, maybe this was fixable (maybe through couples therapy) but he always refused to go with me.

I (woman in 20s) live outside India, struggling with career, not completely settled.
Mother at home facing domestic violence. She won't call the police or choose divorce as an option. 
I can't keep flying back again and again, although I did a couple of times.
I have faced domestic violence myself when I was at home. Father has extreme anger issues and is a complete narcissist, it is not the case of drinking and hitting.This has always been the situation at home since my childhood.
I am getting stressed, and exhausted and always nervous about it happening again. Can't see mother in pain. 
Since I am a woman, she is of the belief of the society norms of not staying with daughters. 
How do I protect my mother? She has denied everything I can think of as a solution - no divorce, no police (as she can't deal with court cases etc and won't be able to spend so much money) , and wouldn't live with me. She probably mostly hides daily fights but tells me sometimes when she is extremely upset or got hit by my father very badly. It's been so many years of even thinking about it spiritually that maybe karma might take care of the situation itself. Relatives are tired of getting involved and explaining again and again. Neighbors are used to hearing the screaming sounds from the house every now and then. Feeling pretty helpless.

I personally and ideally would want to pull her out of that house permanently with a proper divorce. I can manage finances myself. I am ready to give in a couple of weeks by taking leaves from office. But she says I will destroy my career if I get into this. Exhauoall options. Pretty tired mentally.

Both parents are educated. Father has excessive male ego and calls himself head of the family and everything should happen according to him.

To be BEATEN FOR THE SMALLEST MISTAKES, like not doing what they asked immediately because you were still finishing another task? Or to be the OUTLET OF THEIR ANGER AT SOMEONE ELSE, as if your existence makes you the easiest target?  

These past few days, it happened again. I have BRUISES ON MY ARMS now because YOU HIT ME WITH A CHAIR. Why? Because I didn‚Äôt do your command right away, I was still finishing the first thing you asked. And then I GET SCOLDED BY MOM, told it was MY FAULT FOR NOT OBEYING QUICKLY. BOTH OF YOU ARE THE SAME.  

Do you remember? Back then, you‚Äôd BEAT US ALMOST EVERY DAY, MAKE US KNEEL ON SALT, LASH US WITH ANYTHING YOU COULD GRAB. You‚Äôd SCREAM THE MOST HURTFUL WORDS, BREAK EVERYTHING IN SIGHT, AND THROW THE PIECES AT US. You almost BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF MY YOUNGER BROTHER ONCE, all because you misheard them responding to you. And yet, somehow, WE‚ÄôRE THE PROBLEM?  

You ask why we cry. You ask why I FLINCH WHEN YOU RAISE YOUR VOICE, when your hand moves too quickly, when you pick up random objects. I forgave you once, back when I still believed YOU‚ÄôD CHANGE, when I convinced myself the ABUSE WAS OVER. I tried to forget the FEAR OF BEING IN THIS HOUSE, the TREMBLING EVERY TIME YOU WALKED BY, the PANIC WHENEVER YOU SPOKE. But now, YOU TWIST THE NARRATIVE, MANIPULATE THE SITUATION, and ask me why I feel this way?  

WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO GO? If I stay in my room, YOU‚ÄôRE ANGRY. If I sit in the living room, YOU COMPLAIN. If I leave the house, YOU ACCUSE ME OF BEING DISRESPECTFUL. WHERE DO I BELONG?  

Why do some parents CARRY THIS CULTURE OF VIOLENCE LIKE IT‚ÄôS A BADGE OF AUTHORITY? Why do they think they can CONTROL THEIR CHILDREN WITH FEAR AND PAIN, THEN DEMAND LOVE AND OBEDIENCE IN RETURN? At what point will they REALIZE THE DAMAGE THEY‚ÄôVE DONE, or is it easier to pretend it doesn‚Äôt exist?  ",2024-12-04 01:26:18,2025-03-17 03:06:08,violence

On 12/23 I was granted a temp no contact restraining order for myself, child and fianc√© of 3 1/2 years against my child‚Äôs father. Court hearing is in three weeks. Just a few days before got the restraining order granted, I had gone to pick up my child from his dad‚Äôs house on my child‚Äôs birthday. Little one had been sick the whole week prior and had to stay home. My partner works fully remote and I work hybrid. My son‚Äôs father was livid that I left little home home with my partner while I went to work one day. He began to say I‚Äôm neglecting him.. little one is very taken care of my myself and partner no matter if we are working from home. He still comes first! So when I went to pick up little his dad came charging to my car without my son, he screamed at me calling me a Cnt bitch and saying I need to take care of our son. He got in my face and eventually pushed me as I was walking towards him. The police questioned me walking towards him. It wasn‚Äôt fast or in an aggressive way, I can‚Äôt explain the reasoning but I did get a little closer after his dad had came but up to me and then he pushed me. I recorded the whole thing, I‚Äôm calm in the video.. 

I don‚Äôt have much tangible evidence besides this video and old photos of marks on my body. I‚Äôve tried to use the old photos during custody modifications but the lawyers always say ‚Äúwhy are you bringing this up now‚Äù 

.. I‚Äôve been hopeless until this video. Please if you‚Äôve been through this can you tell me what I can expect at the hearing in 3 weeks? 

Dad gets two visits a week right now that is monitored per court order. I want this to continue for at least a year and make him take classes for a year‚Ä¶ I want my kiddo to have his dad but even my little one is scared of his dad. 

Dad has also threatened my partners live a number of times. One time we did get it documented on a police report.. one time dad told me he should have killed him when he had the chance. 

It‚Äôs on going verbal insults, hardly ever over text only on the phone or in person. 

I didn‚Äôt file anything against him before because I was young and not well. He was and remains abusive.. ",2024-12-26 05:01:10,2025-03-17 03:06:11,violence

1g1tw3l,Is this domestic violence/abuse?,angieisdead69,7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1g1tw3l/is_this_domestic_violenceabuse/,"Hi, me (16F) in june,got out of a relationship that lasted a year with my ex (19M). 
I need some perspective. Was this normal behavior and I was exaggerating or was I abused?
So, first of all I‚Äôm sorry if my english isn‚Äôt perfect, I‚Äôm not a native speaker, but I will try my best. 
As I was saying, in may of 2023 i got with my ex-boyfriend, who was 18 at the time and i was 14. It all started when we met with friends in common and we started to date pretty quickly, after a week of knowing each other. I don‚Äôt know if I was love bombed or if we just rushed things too much, but in a month or so i met his family, and i was spending nights at his house, he would buy me gifts, we would spend all out time together and he would shower me with attention and love.
After some time, 2 months or so, he started showing some signs of instability, but i shrugged it off because i thought he was just insecure or some stupid shit like that.
But it got worse, we would argue for days and days, and he started to humiliate me and insult me for hours doing these arguments. Then he started showing some signs of physical violence.
In the year that we‚Äôve been together, he has done some pretty nasty things. But i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm exaggerating.
He would slap me hard on my back and on my thighs, push me, drag me across the room or throw things at me.
He destroyed my phone, and torn two nails from my fingers ( I don‚Äôt think it was on purpose, but he didn‚Äôt apologize)
He also crossed many boundaries and would repeatedly ask me for sex even if i wasn‚Äôt in the mood, and if we didn‚Äôt do it he would get mad and grumpy.
Then after we broke up he kept contacting me, and when i told him that i was seeing another guy, he went crazy, threatening me and saying that he hopes that he uses me and treats me like shit.
So, what do you think? Is this normal behavior? Because i‚Äôve been experiencing some panic attacks when someone hits me or yells at me. Every opinion is appreciated! Thank you :)",2024-10-12 06:12:06,2025-03-17 03:06:16,violence

I honestly wasn't expecting that nor wanted him to get charged, I simply wanted an order to allow me to get my property and leave, he has had a prior order on him from an ex whom he grabbed by the throat while angry but that order wqs removed by his ex. 

Honestly he is a good guy and this incident was an isolated event with me, he has never otherwise physically hurt me or assaulted me before, i don't want to see him go to jail and i'm scheduled in the morning to go in at 9am back at the police station they said. I made it clear to the officer that i simply wanted to get my belongings and wasn't looking to get a restraining order or press charges on him.

Is there anything i can do to remove the charges?  Even though he grabbed me like that and did get physical i feel this has gone way beyond what it needed and a simple order to allow me to take my things and move out. He isn't an otherwise bad person or someone who would abuse me, I think he just git very upset and was trying to hold me back in his frustration.

Even in the prior incident with his ex his ex cancelled his restraining order as he was the one who made the situation worse and agravated him.

What should i do? I don't want to see him go to jail and regardless of the relationship ending it hurts to see him possibly face jail and have to go through such a process when he is otherwise a good person.",2023-12-15 07:51:35,2025-03-17 03:06:17,violence

I saw a lot of violence towards my mother as a child. When I was a child, I simply masked all my emotions relating to violence through getting in trouble with authority and becoming obsessively involved with my schoolwork. I don't have trouble talking to women but forming deep relationships with women is very difficult. As a result, I turned to many systems that I thought would help me overcome this. I tried going to therapy on two different occasions but quit after experiencing no growth for months on end. I tried martial arts twice for about 6 months each as I thought it would help me foster a different connection to the violence. It ended up making me more pissed as it always seemed like I never found anyone who can connect with violence the way I do. I tried going to Acupuncture therapy twice as well, to no avail. I tried doing tons of psychedelic drugs to see if that would help. Living my life on drugs was the closest thing I experienced to a life where violence doesn't affect me as negatively as it has. I'm very scared that as violence is such a major part of the real and legal world, that either I'm going to commit a act of violence that I can't overcome or that I may blow my brains out to see if I can deal with violence better in a different spiritual realm.

base facts for understanding
-we were together for over 7 years
-about 2 and a half months ago he snapped because I scuffed his shoe and he stewed on it for 30 seconds before stomping on my ankle. this was the first act of physical violence against me, though there has been other instances where I've been scared.
-I was alienated from my friends and family because he begged me not to tell them
-it took 3 weeks to get him to let me go to a doctor, I was supposed to lie, I did not lie, doctor got me on touch with a social worker and helped me with a safety plan
-I have a cat from before we were together, our first dog he bought but legally is mine, the 2nd dog I bought and is legally mine.
-we have no children
-I am financially stable on my own and we have a cohabitation agreement so I can't lose the house.
-the first year and a half we lived together he was the breadwinner while I was in university. the bills for 60him/40me, once I finished school we were 50/50 for a year and a half. after I bought the house bills became 90 me 10 him and I was lucky if he paid me back for food in a month, this has been like this for 3 years. 
-in the years I was in university his mom told anyone who would listen that I was a gold digger. She never apologized.
-he started counselling for his anger issues about a month ago
-I asked him to leave about 2 weeks ago, he begged me to stay and just call it a break, I said I'd love to forgive him but its going to take time and I don't know if I can get past the fear of him doing it again. and domestic violence is as bad as cheating in my opinion. we went to a couples counselling session together and have another one scheduled.
-he's been staying with his parents since.
-he took the dog that he bought but drops her off most days because I work from home and can take care of her.
-since I asked him to leave he has started an anger management course and is trying to do a domestic violence handbook written for abusers to try to not be abusive
-I do beleive he is genuinely sorry. and if I had to bet I would bet he wouldn't do it again. but even if the ""he does it again"" chance is 10%.... I dont want to risk that.

Okay so base facts down here's the rant. I love him. I really do. but I'm just dying inside. these past 2 weeks alone even though they've been hard it's actually been easier to be alone. the worst part is the dog. everyone keeps saying that he's just taking the dog to keep a connection with me. I love that dog. I've done everything for that dog every vet appointment every bag of food every dog license, microchip, spaying, when she had her first heat, 3 levels of dog school and we got good enough we had a dance routine. and he says ""I think you miss the dog more than me"" I DO!!! THE DOG DIDNT STOMP ON MY ANKLE YOU DID! ""I know seeing me every day is hard but I just want the dog to have a sense of normalcy"" IF YOU CARED ABOUT THE DOGS SENSE OF NORMACY YOU'D JUST LEAVE HER HERE! my coworkers all said  ""do you care that she's taken care of or that she's with you?"" and I do care more than she's taken care of.... I just wish it was by me.

Then I've been BEGGING for space. I need space to heal and every day ""is this enough space? how do you feel about us? do you feel like we made progress yesterday? how do you think you're going to learn to feel safe with me again if I'm never around you?"" I FEEL SMOTHERED!!!! SOOOOOOO SMOTHERED!!!!! 

Then I have the dog he took back this weekend (he's out of town for work) I'm enjoying my day with my puppies. and his mom texts me ""hey how are you"" and im like ""oh she's just trying to be nice"" so I answer ""im doing okay in the grand scheme of things, better than *name* unfortunately"" because like it is unfortunate I don't want him to be sad I'm just trying to prioritize myself and my healing because NOBODY ELSE WILL and she goes off like ""you have to start putting trust back in if you want this to work""

I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU THAT YOU GET TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE YOU DONT HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PERSON WHOS SUPPOSED TO LOVE YOU AND WONDER WHAT LITTLE THING YOU DO IS GOING TO SET THEM OFF! I do not live in that world. I get to live in the world where the stat ""1/4 women will experience domestic violence"" I never get to be a part of that 3/4 again. I am now the 1/4. but thank you MIL for reminding me that once again I am alone.

She shows all the traits of an abusive controlling jealous and angry partner including not letting me work or have relationships with people.

Everything I do is met with punishment. 

No one understands. And it making me sour to people. 

Police blatantly ignore this. And so does the NDVH or the Hotline. I sent help texts out a month and a half ago and they sent an APS lady to be nice to my face and then angry and abusive over messages.

They have no regard to what she‚Äôll do to me. I can‚Äôt take it anymore. 

This is the only way I can contact people and they blocked it.

Growing up I witnessed a lot of domestic violence between my father and mother, as well as between him and my brother, and it being aimed at me. I always tried to rationalise it but it hit a peak recently where my mum is in the process of divorcing him, thank god.
I feel like I‚Äôve suddenly become aware of how much I‚Äôve witnessed and experience growing up- physically, emotionally. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly going to have a panic attack. 
I‚Äôm in therapy but is there any other support for adults who witnessed/experienced domestic violence as a child? I‚Äôm UK based and would appreciate any info. ",2024-11-13 12:51:24,2025-03-17 03:06:31,violence

It sucks cause I‚Äôve been trying everything I can to get away. I stayed because it was cheaper than doing this. I‚Äôm not going back.

1edfjis,Unbelievable violence at next door,Hot-Data3404,5,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1edfjis/unbelievable_violence_at_next_door/,"I live in North York for many years, and never felt unsafe before yesterday. I came to Canada because everyone I ever met they made me feel so nice. That's why I never doubt any sec to stay in such a lovely country. Then, until yesterday, I started thinking because of a condo neighbours domestic violence matter.

My neighbour next door is a couple, and I truly don't know if they are married or not, but they sometimes invite fellas to come over. I also realized they have a cute dog when they first moved in cuz it barks a lot. That's everything I know about them.

Yesterday I woke up at noon and took a quick shower to fresh up, then I heard on the other side of wall there's a man verbally abused a woman and woman was crying so loud and terrified. Until I finished my shower, the noise didn't stop and the fight last for almost 20 mins. I can't believe such a terrible noise can last that long and no one step out to take care of it, so I call the security to come up and check out the noise and make sure no one is in danger because I heard something smashed. The first time I called security and there's no one came up, and I waited for 30 mins and still no one showed up. Fortunately, my neighbour finally went quiet. Then I called security again to tell them the noise went down but I wish there's no one got hurt, I wanted to know if anyone was sent to check on them and is everything fine......Security lied to me, she said she sent someone, and the truth is she didn't. I did not see anyone. I asked her if she called police instead of sending someone and she said she can't call police without check, and she told she did not report to the manager yet, then she said to me in a rude manner, ""next time you should call the police on your behalf"". I was so pissed. As a woman, I feel sorry for that woman next door; and as a tenant, I feel shocked what security said and she did. She also a woman!!!!! OFC I will call the police by myself next time since I know what kind of security my building hired!!!!!

Since yesterday I didn't see that woman came out from that room, and I don't know how she's going to overcome these and protect herself. I think the neighbour next door they probably are immigrants cuz they don't speak in English privately, and that woman may not know in Canada there's law can protect her safety. Or......what I can ever imagine in the worst situation......if the immigration is the reason she cannot leave that guy???

To be honest, back to the fact, I don't hate any races or anyone. The truth is I can tolerant diversities in my circle cuz diversities do bring out more fun in life. However, I wish I immigrate to a place that people enjoy peace and compassion, also the quality of immigrants do relevant to the average national quality.",2024-07-27 12:44:30,2025-03-17 03:06:38,violence

Hes 34 im 28 we have been together for a year and few months we live with his family. Our situation has gradually gotten worse first hed burp in my face, hed make me pay more than half of our activities together, i remember our very first Christmas together which was last year i made him excited for his present then we had a conversationa about how he would take me shopping if i got him a really expensive collectible item for $400, time came and he said oh i didnt say that and plus i dont have a lot of money rn. i said its okay don't worry i then said what will you get me he then said idk what do you want? remember baby i dont have a lot of money rn either.¬† Through the beginning hed call me little names like the r word, stupid, idiot and what not, hed tell me to stop asking so many questions, after a while of no questions i just started to speak my mind thinking this would settle his mind because it wasnt asking questions but now he tells me he cant focus on his phone while hes scrolling through youtube while i talk to him or out loud to the. When i do mind my business he looks at me and says why cant you be in the middle or why are you so quiet. If i tell him my plans he will say no planning i dont wanna know dont tell me i dont care. When i walk about my feelings he says i dont care. He will give me a disappointed look like can you stop talking. A few months ago we were arguing coming out of a drive thru he was upset because i like too many sauces and because i was asking him about what we were gonna do the next day. We then went home and he ran out back because he said he needed to get away from me for a decond.¬† Then i told him im sorry i feel like if i say anything i upset you its like i cant be myself around you. He got upset and punched a tree in the back. His hand was then broken for a month he was off of work. He blames me and says its all your fault. If you didnt do this this wouldn't have happened its your fault he says when he looks at me i want to cry. A few days ago he was hiding his phone so i got paranoid and went through his instagram at 4 am and saw that he was still on tinder a week after our relationship had formed messaging a girl saying hey its me from tinder and i woke him up and asked him whats this? he flipped out and started beating a house object and i grabbed him to make him stop hurting himself and unfortunately his arm got strained. Now he blames me for his arm being hurt too. After that happened he woke up his whole house and they were like whats going on. He told them. Then he walked out front and i followed. He started saying¬† i dont even know how that got there i wasnt talking or on tinder after we got together and i didnt even message her back either after that one i stopped. I said okay okay. He said i cant be with you if we cant trust each other he said we need to work on this. Then i was saying okay okay and he yelled and said more things like you evil effing b word, he said you stupid and a few more things after that. Then i got scared and said okay im gonna leave i cant do this being as loud as him and then he told me to calm down get inside stop being loud as hes yelling at me on his front porch then he like pushes me front and knocks me down by tripping me from the back i fell pretty hard and he gets in my face and shouts at me more. I kept trying to hug him while i was crying saying im sorry im sorry but he kept pushing me off a few times hed shove me. I was just so emotional. We then sat on a wall and i was about to fall down being distraught and he said common lets go down and as he was putting his foot off he he kicked me in the tummy a little. He said sorry sorry but i felt the anger the anger in his foot. That day i had back pain at work. I told my work and i couldn't work the whole day. I left early. He also spat on me while he was upset during this stuff forgot to say. He makes jokes about killing me. Today he made a coffin joke saying its because. he gets mad if i ask him abything or anything. He hates me sometimes i feel. I feel hes only with me because im all he can get. He doesnt like to touch me or kiss me or make out too much he says stop kissing me so much when I just give him face loves. He isnt cheating. He doenst let me leave really much anymore too. If i go he says youre leaving me. He gets mad and says if you do that ill go without you. Hes the lonesome wolf type and he used to get bullied for stuff like weight and stuff in the past how can i help him love him? How can i make him see me? How can i keep his love? Im his first love. I want him to be my last love. I dont want to fail him.

December 22, 2023 I got arrested for a class A misdemeanor assault causing bodily injury for punching my spouse on the side of her stomach. I pleaded for deferred adjudication and was given 9 months probation, with community hours and a bipp program. 

Fast forward to August 20th, 2024. I got arrested for the same charge in a different county with my spouse again. Weeks later she emailed the victims advocate saying she falsified the police report for her own personal gain given we‚Äôre going through a divorce and a divorce isn‚Äôt something that she wanted. She simply didn‚Äôt want to accept that I wanted a separation. The victims advocate forwarded that email to the prosecutors office and my court hearing for this 2nd charge got delayed because they‚Äôre trying to find any additional evidence against me. 

Is there anybody that has gone through a situation similar? Anybody with experience or knowledge with criminal cases like this? 

An MTR was issued and I‚Äôm turning myself in on Friday, 2 days from now. I have bond, but after that will be my hearing for probation revocation. I did hire an attorney for this.

1fbaqn8,Witnessed domestic violence at age of 3.,GoodNico09,4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1fbaqn8/witnessed_domestic_violence_at_age_of_3/,"So Back in 2012 (yes im still pretty young) my dad was abusive toward my mother. I don‚Äôt remember anything except when I witnessed what my dad did to my mom.

I saw him beating up my mom, I was watching quietly, I did nothing, not even a scream of terror or cry. I just watched immobile terrified what I was witnessing. I was supposed to be outside playing with my 2 older sisters, not witnessing something that would change my life. And I still have very precise memory from this specific moment.

At the time I was the youngest of the family (3y old), one of my sister was 7 years old at the time and the other sister was 10 years old. I think in the familly I was the only one to have witnessed the domestic violence.

My dad was not abusive toward us, but he was neglecting us. One time (I don‚Äôt remember it) he locked up me and my 2 sisters in the car, for no reason.

And yes there were dramatic consequences to what I witnessed. After that my mom saw that I was starting to have trouble speaking, and that my motor skills were worse than before. I got diagnosed with dyspraxia and dysphasia (or aphasia, idk what its called).

My parents divorced the same year (2012). And my dad went back to live in portugal like 2 years after (I live in central europe.) and since then I very rarely see him. and the year after the incident I got nightmares frequently. I had PTSD when I was like 4!

At the end the only thing that help me cope with these memories are my plushies. I do not age regress, I am very very attached to my plushies. Its my only way I can feel better and feel understood.

I never would have known how bad it was had survivors like me not blatantly said alarming words like ‚ÄúRUN‚Äù and ‚Äúget out before he kills you‚Äù. 

I felt trapped knowing I was sleeping next to someone who could murder me while not knowing what step to take next. Even after my eyes were opened to his sick ways I still questioned whether I was exaggerating‚Ä¶.

Abuse isn‚Äôt constant. There are good times that make the horrible dark times seem light. How can someone make me feel so good, loved and safe‚Ä¶then turn around and make me feel worthless, insecure, and alone? The cycle becomes addicting. I tolerate the lows because I know they are followed by highs (love bombing). 

But at the end of the day, I felt helpless. Dependent on someone who provided relief for the pain they caused. I felt misunderstood. Alone. Crazy. Sad. Abandoned. 

Physical scars heal but emotional scars stay. My ex built me into who he needed me to be and then broke me down every time I started to gain independence. It took $22,000 in facial damages for me to ‚Äòopen my eyes‚Äô and leave.

You can‚Äôt lose yourself if you don‚Äôt know who you truly are. That‚Äôs exactly who abusers seek out - the wounded, self-sabotaging, worth-seeking, lonely individuals who they can mold into their next victim. 

I found myself through prayer, and being reminded that I AM loved by the unchanging, unwavering God the Father. He doesn‚Äôt love me any less or any more today than he did the day he pulled me away from my ex. He has brought me SO far ü§ç and no matter what avenue you take, you can make it out too!

I am 100% certain he would have killed me if I didn‚Äôt leave. I am so fortunate to be here today telling my story. I pray this finds the right people and you make it out so you can tell your testimony too.

I dated my partner for nearly four years until we broke up in March because he started dating other people. He says he's in love with me, but he knows that I'm not in love with him. Unfortunately, we are still living together. He has been violent with me in the past, always during arguments, but he's never left bruises or anything. In the past, he would sulk when I refused sex and demand a long talk/make me explain myself over and over/sometimes lose his temper. But this past year, his personality has changed. He has a history of serious assault on an ex partner. Here are some of the things he has started doing to me:

* Picking fights, then accusing me of being abusive/hateful/toxic/etc when I react
* Grabbing things (mostly my phone) out of my hands, then criticizing me for ignoring him
* Once in May, he tried to hack into my email/computer/socials when I left the house
* Twice recently he's insisted on bringing me lunch at my job (this feels controlling but I can't explain why -- I know it seems like a nice gesture)
* Suddenly criticizing me and calling me a narcissist/explaining all of my faults out of nowhere
* Criticizing/raising his voice at me for absurd things like saying ""sure"" to a request instead of ""yes,"" then getting more angry when I defend myself  
* Jokingly pushing me down when I stand up from the couch (he's done this three times, I got mad and asked him to stop and he laughed at me and called me a baby) 
* Pouting or starting an argument/excruciatingly long ""talk"" 
* Physically blocking me from leaving a room after he starts an argument

I am very isolated, but I'm extra confused because he doesn't tell me where I can/can't go or what I can/can't wear, take my money, prevent me from seeing people, or other hallmarks of abusive relationships. One thing he has always done, though, is offer to accompany me just about anywhere. This has made me feel much less independent even though he isn't forceful about it. 

In March, he got mad that I wouldn't speak to him (I wasn't trying to stonewall, I just knew that anything I said would only make him angrier) so he pushed me down into a chair a number of times, blocked me from leaving, then when I got outside, he chased me around, grabbing me by my clothes and shoulders and arms and restraining me from leaving. At one point he grabbed my face and screamed at me to look at him. I scratched his arm to try to get him to let go, and he told me that I had abused him.

A few days ago, he chased me up the stairs into my room. I tried to lock the door behind me, but he was on the other side, so I couldn't lock it. I was holding it shut with all of my weight when he rammed his body against the door and I crashed into the wall, then stumbled into my mirror. It left a bruise and a rugburn on my elbow. Then he straddled me on the bed and screamed in my face, told me all of this was my fault, and started licking his fingers and trying to rub them all over my face. Then he told me not to bother locking my door because he could get in whatever he wants, and locking my door would only make him more angry. 

The next day, I expected an apology, but he told me that I'm lucky to have a face. He said that he ""loves himself"" and he's ""incredible"" for ""showing restraint."" He said that if I were a man, he would have beaten the shit out of me. He said I'm lucky that he was willing to spend time with me.

He's out of town for the weekend. I told my family and best friend (both live far away) and they are very concerned for me. They're telling me that I can't share a space with him any longer and I need to stay in a shelter or something, but I have a full time job and a dog. Obviously I don't want to live with him any longer, but our lease is up in October. Can I wait until then?? Is this domestic abuse, even without the classic controlling signs? I feel sick to my stomach when I think back on the past several years. I'm so overwhelmed and my family is making me even more afraid. 

I don't have any friends in my city that I could stay with. Just acquaintances that I'm not comfortable asking. ",2024-07-27 22:33:33,2025-03-17 03:07:51,violence

I live with my gf in a town away from my family and I‚Äôve been physically and emotionally abused by her for a little over two years. 

For a while I didn‚Äôt take the abuse personally, maybe because I‚Äôm a man and somewhere deep down feel I should be able to take some punches. But it‚Äôs been going on for over a year now and I have to make a move. My gf has so many mental health issues and essentially relies on me to take care of her. She also is an alcoholic which fuels her psychotic episodes. Our lease is up in July but we haven‚Äôt talked about breaking up or anything even though she suspects I‚Äôm going to do it (which fuels her abusive episodes). 

Another aspect is that she has almost no support system, misunderstanding mother as well as an alcoholic narcissist father. They both feel overwhelmed with dealing with her so it‚Äôs up to me to get her medication or take her to appointments. Her brother is great but just had a baby with his wife. I guess she‚Äôll be moving in with them when the lease is up but I have so much anxiety. 

My gf is also suicidal and threatens suicide often. She has said before very frankly that if I left her she‚Äôd ‚Äúprobably kill‚Äù herself. I want to believe that things can be ok after I‚Äôm gone but every part of my being is anxious to. 

Any words of advice are much appreciated, also I‚Äôm in the Missouri US if anyone has any resources.

Just curious if anyone else feels like you have to take hours out of your day to deal with continuous violations to a DVO which was awarded for 3 years, the maximum in my state. I feel like I‚Äôm doing all the work while he‚Äôs sitting back and violating the DVO almost everyday with any consequences. 

I‚Äôve been trying to file contempt against him for the DVO. He‚Äôs hacked all my phone, accessed and changed things, was able to access EVERYTHING in my phone. Pics, texts, phone conversations, all email correspondence, files‚Ä¶you name it‚Ä¶he has accessed it. A lot of what he accessed is personal and puts me in more danger of harm by him. He knows my alarm code, everything I‚Äôm doing to file charges against him, etc. 

He has got into my USPS app where I receive informed deliveries and has rerouted many packages and has stolen packages out of my locked mail box inside my building. (I live in a condo so it‚Äôs cluster mailboxes) In the DVO it‚Äôs stated clearly that he cannot be 500 feet from me. Including my residence if I‚Äôm home or not. 

He is a servre alcoholic and is dillusioniinal. Thinks people are watching. Says he‚Äôs god and that the CIA watches him, etc.   He takes make antipsychotic medications. He is a harm ti anyone he comes in contact with.

He has told me that he‚Äôs ready to die. I have no doubt he would kill me then kill himself.

I live in a constant state of fear.  

I‚Äôm exhausted and am trying to fight for my life but it‚Äôs sure not easy. I‚Äôve unfortunately seen the lack of resources and help there really is for DV victims. 

It‚Äôs affecting every part of my life. I thought he would just go away after the DVO instead it unleashed an eviler monster whom is out to get me and I don‚Äôt know why. ",2024-08-16 17:38:27,2025-03-17 03:08:01,violence

My partner isn't consistently physically abusive (only a couple times but he wasn't sober) but is regularly emotionally and verbally abusive according to my therapist. The problem is that he doesn't see it as abuse which makes me not see it as abuse either but my therapist is insistent. He just sees it as ""expressing his feelings"" or something similar. I have been in very physically abusive situations in the past (different partners) so it took awhile for me to understand the emotional part of it but I can honestly say this hurts worse than the physical part. 

Anyways, he doesn't listen to me or my therapist because he thinks I'm lying to her so she's biased. So I'm thinking that some kind of group like AA but for relationships where there multiple people who can give input might make him belive he needs to change.

I have a friend who had moved into a low budget neighborhood and has only been trouble since.

She met a man in the same apartment complex and started hanging out and became romantic until she started seeing red flags after a couple months. The previous residents of her apartment were part of Domestic violence as well and the lock would not lock on her door. At some point, he had taken her keys and made a copy without her knowledge. So for about a month+ he comes in and stays without her consent and has gotten more violent as time passes. As far as Im aware, there is rape, death threats of family and anyone who is willing to get in the way, sexual assault, blades to her throat, and keeps her up at consistently as night so she is sleep deprived and has weapons with him all the time.

Ive offered help and got her lock fixed through a handyman because the landlords wont fix it for her. but even then he still has a copy of the key. She's got a long list of abuse done to her and has a recording of him talking about the death threats, his obsession and agreeing to some physical violence.

She's finally reached out to the cops after Ive suggested getting a Protective Order but she's worried that hes the kind of man to kill her and himself if an order is put in place. And even if he is convicted of his felonies, She's worried about Him being able to pay Bail and then its back to the normal stuff.

She can only afford this housing and has a kid shes trying to put into a decent school so moving is off the table.

What Are the consequences of violating a Protective order? She says he'll only be held for 24hrs but that doesn't seem right.
Is she right to be scared and not go through with the Protective Order?
what other options are there? 
Security systems? Resources?
I can only help so much but its all up to her

Her in-laws are harassing her and torturing her for money. Finding fault in everything she does.

We found the match via matrimonial website. Her husband didn't mention his smoking and drinking habits. Even though he is earning decent money, he is always short of funds. He hurls abuse at my sister and asks her to leave his home. He once even pushed her out of his home late at night. He drinks and smokes almost every day. He has increased cholesterol because of that. He is very manipulative and lies all the time. He makes things up like being threatened to be beaten by us. (we have recordings of his lies)

We paid for all events from Roka to the Wedding. Even partially paid for her honeymoon. We gave her a decent amount of gold and gifts. We have the recordings (they asking for chain and FDs) and receipts of jewellery and transfers made to them for paying Banquets and all.



My questions are :

1. Are call recording and other recording acceptable in court?

2. My sister's jewellery is in a locker of his in-laws at their native place. How can we make sure that we get it back and the amount we transferred to his account?

3. while my sister is there, if anything alarming happens like a fight or if his husband hits her what should she do? ( though he has hit her with his elbow while on their honeymoon. She was too terrified to report)

4. Should she leave her home on her own, or should we go there to bring her back? ( keeping in mind we want to get back the jewellery given during the wedding)

5. Can this marriage be annulled?( as he lied about his height, habits and he has some sexual issue though I am not sure as he consulted with a specialist about it)

6. As my sister not working, will she be entitled to alimony or maintenance?

7. What cases can be filed against such a fraudster and cheap person and his sister who fuels and controls her brother's demeanor?

8. How can we protect ourselves from him filing a false case against us?

9. Are there any good NGOs that can assist and help in Bangalore and Ajmer?

He uses rage and aggression to force me to have sex with him, and promised me that he will become violent if I don't capitulate to sex with him. I find him physically repulsive to all of my senses,, and I need to dissociate when he rapes me, to stop me from killing him in the act.

He is a very dangerous individual. People steer away from him and he loses friends left and right, everyone citing his terrifying and erratic behavior as the reason. He has an ex-girlfriend that one day just took all her belongings and left him while he was at work, and never spoke to or saw him again. I know now why she had to do this.

He regularly drives drunk and tries to instruct people on shooting while drunk. He is also an erratic driver prone to road rage even when sober, and he is ready to shoot at drivers as he has his hand on his gun whenever someone cuts him off in traffic.

He is an enormous pervert and misogynist that regularly tries to pressure me into sexual acts I despise, I have also watched him sexually harass a woman right in front of me. He has a vile, sickening view of women and sex.

He has lost control physically before and wrestled me into strange sexual positions against my will and pushed my legs behind my head and stretched my mouth open with his fingers while calling me a whore and slut. This was a violent act when he lost control of his rage. He then slapped me across the face and spat in my face. He regularly spits on my face.

I am desperate to get away from him but I have major problems

1) I am disabled and mildly depend on him
2) I have been laid off from my job and am running out of money fast. I have been applying to jobs nonstop and no one wants to hire me, even though I have a college degree and lots of experience.
3) We have pets together that I adore and do not want to leave, he is an irresponsible and careless pet owner.
4) I am almost never home alone & he has cameras outside of the house, so he'd know if I leave.
5) He is suspecting me HIGHLY of leaving, he told me this recently so he's on to me.
6) He is highly suspicious of the main person who is aware of his abuse of me, this same person is also helping me create a plan to leave him.

Please I am begging for help. I am his prisoner. I am being raped regularly. I feel he may kill me. I have many video recordings of his rage and also screenshots of him admitting that he demands sex ""or else."" 

I have never been this miserable and depressed in my whole life. I am dead inside. I have several times considered ending it all just to escape this.

Forgot to add that he is talking about having a baby ASAP. He refuses to use condoms and regularly ""finishes"" way too close to my vagina carelessly. I think he is trying to impregnate me.",2025-02-25 09:20:42,2025-03-17 03:08:20,help

Reddit, I (42f) need your help.  

My daughter (20f) is in an extremely abusive relationship with her boyfriend (20m) of the last two years. 

In recent weeks, she came to me saying that he had choked her unconscious, then pulled a knife on her after she woke up from being choked.  He later admitted to her that after she had been choked unconscious, he returned to her passed out body and choked her some more!!?!  This is not the first time something like this has happened and I fear / know she‚Äôll end up dead if ties aren‚Äôt severed completely. 

She moved back in with me that day, but refuses to officially end things with him.  I have come to decide that her judgement is compromised, to say the least, and I‚Äôm struggling to know how I can exert influence to save her life without pushing her away and back into his POS arms.  

I discovered last week that she is literally spending hundreds of minutes on the phone with him every day, using AirPods and allowing this asshole to listen in on everything that happens around her, including private conversations between me and my other daughters.  This feels like an insane breach of our privacy, security, etc.

I also stumbled upon her allowing him to deliver her food to my house today!  He pulled up as her ‚Äúdoor dash‚Äù, something only discovered because I entered her room at the right moment for her to not be able to hide it.

I can tell her she can‚Äôt see him, but I fear she‚Äôll just leave.  

REDDIT WHAT DO I DO?!  THIS GUY IS GOING TO KILL MY CHILD AND I AM FORCED TO JUST SIT BACK AND WATCH. 

Please help me figure out a plan to handle this, point me towards resources / those able to help, or just share your insights / wisdom so that I‚Äôve got a fighting chance.  

Thanks in advance.  

Tl;dr - Adult-ish daughter refuses to stop seeing a violent psychopath she‚Äôs dating and I‚Äôm out of ideas about how to save her.",2025-01-14 02:29:24,2025-03-17 03:08:21,help

I did all the right thing, I contacted women‚Äôs aid in my county and surrounding counties. I got legal advice. I even tried speaking to 101 for advice. 

What I learned was that they would not be able to make him leave our home. The home that was bought with a deposit from my inheritance. The house that I work full-time in a demanding job to afford. 

Women‚Äôs aid could not offer me somewhere to stay. I can‚Äôt stay in a hostel, I‚Äôm autistic and I spent enough time in them as a kid to know I couldn‚Äôt do it. If I wanted a house, I‚Äôd need to pay over 1k a month, while also still paying the mortgage on the house to stop it being repossessed. 

The legal advice line I spoke to gave me bad advice. The lawyer I engaged charged me 5k and left me with literally nothing to show. I was physically sick when I got their bill. But they were lawyers and I couldn‚Äôt contest it. 

The police were the worst. I called 101 for advice after I was told to do so. They started harassing me, telling me they were going to come to our house and speak to my husband about what I‚Äôd said. They came to the house in the middle of the night once and luckily he didn‚Äôt notice. I started having panic attacks because I was so terrified that they were going to get me hurt. They completely took away my agency. They also told me that without any evidence from friends or neighbours, it was unlikely he would get any punishment. 

Of the small number of friends and family I have, those who wanted to help couldn‚Äôt do anything to actually help. Those who could didn‚Äôt want to. And I stopped telling anyone about the abuse because all I got was judgement for not leaving. 

Since it started, I developed a serious illness and am now limited physically in what I can do. I think the stress of trying to leave again will kill me if he doesn‚Äôt. ",2024-11-14 15:29:33,2025-03-17 03:08:23,help

One of the women who works there frequently has injuries that have included black eyes, a broken wrist, burst blood vessels in her eyes, and various bruises. It seems like every time I go in there, she's hurt, and I don't pry beyond expressing casual concern. She always has a story that seems plausible - fell down the stairs, got in a car accident, etc.

When we were at the store two weeks ago, she couldn't speak above a raspy whisper and claimed it was laryngitis. I have heard before that strangulation is a huge escalation in domestic violence and I fear for this woman's safety. But I also don't want to make accusations or assumptions when I really have no knowledge. Is there anything I can do to help her?

Don't know if this matters, but she is an immigrant and likely in her early 60s. I don't know anything more than that, but I recognize there could be factors I have absolutely no idea about that could make all of this even trickier.

Thank you.

Added for clarification: She speaks very good English and we communicate quite well. I just don't know what the cultural or legal issues could be surrounding this and I don't want to potentially cause her more trouble by blundering in without understanding.

Over these two years, she‚Äôs become one of my closest friends, and at this point we‚Äôve both admitted that it‚Äôs become more than that really. For context, I work a part-time job and she is also one of my coworkers. One day she showed up to work with CLEAR signs of a physical altercation happening between her and her bf (bruising under the eye), and since that day I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about it. This was about 8 months ago. Around the same time, my roommate was moving out so I was gonna have an open room in my apartment. I ended up telling her that if she ever needs a place to go for a night or to even move into that she is absolutely welcome, and she pretty much said yes on the spot, but warned me that it would take a long time for her to be ready. 

Since then, she‚Äôs told me more about her situation. She ran away from home and moved in with this guy when she was 16, and mind you, this vile dude was my age when he had her do that so not only is he an abuser, he‚Äôs a groomer. He constantly insults her, tells her she‚Äôs useless and that he hates her and doesn‚Äôt even want her around, so the abuse goes beyond physical as well. From what she‚Äôs told me, there is nothing left but a trauma bond in their relationship, and she tells me everyday how she can‚Äôt wait for it to be over. 

Currently, she still wants to move in with me whenever she can, and I‚Äôve made sure she‚Äôs still comfortable with that plan. I try not to push her to do it too hard because I know just dropping everything in your life and leaving on a dime is no small choice, and as well as that I know she‚Äôs trying to avoid doing the same thing that got her into that situation in the first place. I guess what I need guidance on is, what can I do besides just wait? Should I get the police involved if I ever see a physical sign like that again? Should I be encouraging her more? Will I be putting myself, or worse her in danger by inserting myself into her life like that?

Before then it was emotional and mental, but now I fear for the safety of my pets and belongings. 

My partner choked, punched, and slashed at me, I have a very obvious slash on my neck from her, as well as bruises on my face. I'm trying to cover up at work. She broke flower vases, cups, pictures,and other glass all over the house, and then picked up the glass to attempt to cut herself with it.
I'm worried because she is 4'10, and I'm a 5'11 man, I'm not in any incredible physical danger for the most part, I would never hit a woman, and to quite honest it would take a lot for my to fight anyone in general, I'm a non violent person. She has admitted to me before she faked injuries to get her last partner in jail. She claims her last partner was physically abusive, I believed her before, but now I'm unsure. I would never hit anyone, or destroy anyone's belongings, but I'm afraid if I try to leave she will blame these things on me, or hurt my dog.

I had been saving money prior to this lease, I never thought she would get physical, but I could see the trend of other kinds of abuse start to snowball, so I will be financially ok without her, and she should be relatively financially ok without me, so I'm not too worried about starting over, even if I have to leave most of my belongings behind if I need to escape. I really just need my ESA dog.

 I'm on a lease with her for 11 months, and I'm aware that domestic abuse is an avenue to being able to break a lease without penalty, but I'm scared she will beat herself up and try to stick me with the charges instead. I'm a non-violent person, I don't believe in it, but I fear that just like her previous partner, due to the size difference of us both, that they will just believe her if she goes that route.

 Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thank you so much for your time.

I'm the the male in a m/f relationship, we're the same age, close to 30s. We both have drinking issues, but she is a violent and angry drinker. I am not, I go to school, go to work. I've never been arrested, never really lost my shit before. ""High functioning"" alcoholic as it's described. Not saying it's good, I just keep to myself and don't really make noise. We got together long after I knew her from adolescence (6-7 years since we both graduated when we got together) so I was a little more willing to look past the minor things because we had a little bit of a bond. But the minor things became major things, quickly and unexpectedly.

After multiple domestic disturbances in which she was removed from our (my) place, I called in 1 her family and a neighbor called in the other two. Fighting over nothing, yelling screaming, threatening self harm threats any time I try to break it off (turns out she has a history of this) I had just bought the house, she has had no job, and paid 0 bills for 6 years (and she is not on the deed). I was originally Ok with the cooking/cleaning being her responsibility while I cover 90+% of expenses, and she was too. Well the 3rd time she mad a scene, she assaulted a cop and resisted arrest (she's like a 120 pound girl) and he knew her from before and they actually took her. 

I refused to pick her up obviously, giving her the keys was letting her right back into my life. Almost immediately she had to move in with her family in a bordering state, she received a domestic assault charge getting in a fight with her direct family, I had 0 to do with, she was taken to court by the state. I know this from digging because the conditions of getting her things back to her family was very odd, like they could not individually contact her any time they came to pick her things up and a simple question came up like ""where is it? Do you know what she means by this?"" She has a pending court case for that still now, and this was 1 1/2 ago, anyone who knows knows, post Covid judges in rural areas are pushing dates back and back and back unless you're violent felon level.

She was sober for a year. I let her back in like a fucking idiot (but wait there's more) a little more than a year ago. She cleaned up. And we had an awesome relationship for over 400 days. She got into a fight with her family one random night relapsed instantly. Puking, spilling shit everywhere. Started fights again. Neighbors and her family called once each again. She'd been taken away same fashion and brought to county finally after she assaulted a cop right in front of me AGAIN.

This is where it gets to the point where I'm right now absolutely furious and like... I'm about to become the bad guy with how angry I am after being 100% cooperative and level headed the whole time. She's assaulted a cop twice, resisted arrest twice, she's on probation or whatever for domestic assault, and violated every condition in the book. Surely something's going to stick. One day later, while I'm at university, county gives her a personal drive back to the same residence (my home) the incident occurred. And the maintenance guy in my complex let her in without my permission. I call the cops and I'm a little salty. They throw it back but I kind of stand up for myself. ""Well you've let her back in"" yeah well I fuckin didn't do it this time and that was over a year ago, she was hand delivered back to my door and given access without permission. To which he tells me I have to evict her, even if she pays no bills, and has a criminal record for domestic assault, and they've seen her like 6 times under the same circumstances.

So I look at him and I say, ""so after everything that's happened, that's it? That's all I can do?"" ""Yes, do you know how many times we've been here."" I agree with him, ""yeah too much, but how many times has it been because of my behavior?"" I ask him ""how come every time she comes back to me from you guys and now county she's loaded with bruises and now a fresh black eye, but whenever you come here to respond she's untouched."" 

He was there the night before so I ask him,""you were here last night, see that black eye (pretty solid one), it wasn't here last night when she left here was it?"" He kind of backtracks and says yeah no she didn't have any marks last night. I'm just trying to push back at the notion that we're just trash and I beat her in secret and she's lashing out. I've never laid hands on her.

So I'm stuck with her after all this in this very moment. My mother just died this past week. One night later she starts getting hammered and taking pills. Saying that it is because ""she is so sad for me and it's hard for her to handle it."" My mom. Then she starts fights again. I'm doing pre med classes for 7+ hours and figuring out my mothers arrangements the Past two nights, and she's left a burning stove top on and a panini press on for no reason that almost set the cabinets on fire at 1 am. Shes puking, can't form a sentence, most selfish person I've ever seen when she's drunk. And she is NEVER a manageable drunk. So the second ""half"" of the story after the long and good sobriety stint has all taken place in the last two weeks and the burning shit, almost starting fires, puking everywhere, falling all over the place, accidentally breaking shit from stumbling and starting fights over me saying a single word about her not acting like a toddler (in a nice way).   

Am I actually like powerless to do anything in this situation without evicting her? Her names not on a single bill, she hasn't paid a dollar. She has a criminal record, pending sentencing for domestic assault against her family (watch it get dropped) and a consistent record of resisting arrest, putting her hands on officers, and basically making massive public scenes.

I'm getting the vibe the police either do not like me, don't want to deal with it or they're basically just waiting for one of us to snap and go so far over the line one of us will actually get convicted. I'd never say us in the past, but at this point I feel cornered, and if they don't do something soon, something bad is going to happen and it's either going to be her putting me in danger in my own home (again) or me taking matters into my own hands to stop her from doing it.

Sorry for any misspellings or repetitions. I'm like shaking typing this out. Has anyone had a situation where someone will NOT let you break up with them, stay in your home, and when you finally get them out, they get off Scot-free (again) and delivered back to your door. and when you contact the same people from the very same night before they basically tell you too bad?

I just couldn‚Äôt ignore anymore this gut feeling (maybe more than that) that this man was capable of killing me and/or my dogs. 

Recovery has been really hard and long. The first few months I was terrified all the time and dealing with symptoms of PTSD. Something that helped me was that even though we continued to work for the same institution, I was in another area and I hardly ever saw him. A couple of months ago I was offered a promotion that meant relocating to an area where I would see him more often and the possibility of having to ‚Äúcollaborate‚Äù in certain things became a reality. Still, it wouldn‚Äôt be often and it was what I‚Äôve always wanted for myself professionally. But last week, finally I had to share some responsibilities with him. At the beginning I‚Äôd only communicate with him through other people, but after a few days it became obvious that he wasn‚Äôt willing to do his part. 

And I snapped. I went to his office to confront him. I wasn‚Äôt able to even put a foot inside, was shacking and my voice was tense. I demanded him to tell me whether I‚Äôd had to pick up his slack. And shockingly (not really) he blamed me. I didn‚Äôt even get a straight answer, had to do most of his part myself and I can feel he‚Äôs mad at me. I‚Äôm not scared but still angry. I cannot accuse him of doing anything wrong because with other people he‚Äôd say that I could do anything I wanted and he‚Äôd support it, you know, looking good always. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to handle the next time this happens. I don‚Äôt want to feel obligated to share what happened to me. I don‚Äôt want to feel pressured to talk to him. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle moments like these?",2025-02-22 02:13:12,2025-03-17 03:08:39,help

I don‚Äôt know what to do.,Practical_Target7167,0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1hqlgjr/dv_please_help_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"I have been with my kids father for 9 years broke up 2 times in the 9 years due to drug addiction and domestic violence. Fast forward to us getting back together in 2021 . We had a good year and a half and then after that he invite his drug addiction father into out home and later relapsed again . I was pregnant with my 4 baby and he was abusing me . He had been arrested for DV and also I left because he suffers from mental illness. 
I took him to court and he then did the same and lied to the judge and the court so they give him temporary custody. I put a RO on him so he won‚Äôt be able to take my  kids .  He lied to CPS and they should up at my house and never found signs of abuse towards the kids .
 Then when the judge was going to finally hear my side of the story  he asked for a continuance and then asked me and my attorney to negotiate with him and that he will do whatever I want . Mind you he also had a SA charge on him. 
    My attorney told me to accept and so we did but we made a agreement and the agreement has not been yet signed by the judge we sent it like 4-5 time he returned it .  Well he has been threatening me after I didn‚Äôt want to get back with him.  Can he use it in court that I don‚Äôt want to let him see the kids ? It only been two months since we went to court .. is too soon for him to have them unsupervised. He has not changed because you don‚Äôt go from having a history of drug addiction and domestic violence and mental illness to being cured in 2 months 
I seen this before he was sober for 3 years and still relapse so why would I trust he changed in 2 months . 
  He sent me threatening emails a few days ago and I want to make a police report .
 He said ‚Äú you are going to pay for keeping the kids from me and my family ‚Äú I got something for you coming in January‚Äù that‚Äôs around me and his sons bday and he plans on seeing him.
  I don‚Äôt trust him. I feel he is going to go to court and say we don‚Äôt have a agreement and that I‚Äôm keeping the kids . When in reality we barely went to court and the judge has not signed the papers yet .  What do I do‚Ä¶
   I have videos , texts , pics of him abusing me and also in front of our kids .. I have texts of him admitting this I have a lot of evidence to backup what I am saying.  Before I left July 28th he was holding me hostage took my phone and turned the internet off I couldn‚Äôt communicate with anyone and he threatened to kill me and punch my teeth in while I was holding our newborn. He had cameras all over the house to spy on me . He would control where I could watch tv in the house and I had to share my location everywhere I went . He accused me constantly of cheating when I was pregnant even with his dad and friends . 
There so much more he did but what do you guys think I should do? If I let the kids go with him  he will definitely take my kids since my case was dropped when we chose to negotiate we rally don‚Äôt have a custody order and I know the police cant remove them to give them to him but if I willingly let them go he doesn‚Äôt have to return them and that‚Äôs why he wants me to let the kids go to his house 6 hrs away. 
My daughter has PTSD and anxiety attacks after leaving the abuser . The kids don‚Äôt want to live with him but one of my boys does .",2024-12-31 18:59:08,2025-03-17 03:08:40,help

I couldn‚Äôt push her back because she‚Äôs actually surprisingly strong so all i said was for her to not touch me. i‚Äôm so sick of living with her i can‚Äôt deal with it- i can‚Äôt deal living with a narcissistic abusive manipulative bipolar or borderline stuck up bitch. it‚Äôs so hard dealing with her everyday and i don‚Äôt like complaining about it to my best friend because her family life is worse so what i go through sounds so nice compared to hers. so i came on reddit to ask how do i deal with her? She literally loves my dad‚Äôs DOG more over me. if she had to choose between that dog or me, it‚Äôs be the dog. why do narcissists love animals? she always degrades me, saying i‚Äôm not right and she‚Äôs right because she‚Äôs older,  she‚Äôs punched me once- but it was on the back because i turned around and i didn‚Äôt get any bruises so it obviously wasn‚Äôt that bad. but she‚Äôs unpredictable so i‚Äôm always scared when i argue with her because i don‚Äôt know how she‚Äôll hurt me . she‚Äôs kicked the back of my leg in when she was arguing with me over my pet lizard, she punched me in the back a few times when she told me off for leaving the lights on in the kitchen even tho i was literally in there making toast, she‚Äôs thrown shit at me like books and sandals lol. but today was the worst imo, she‚Äôs never done anything like that before which is making me scared it‚Äôs only gonna get worse. She starts arguments over tiny things and then says i started it which is why it‚Äôs hard for me to be the bigger person sometimes because i get tired of her bullshit. argued with me because i closed a curtain. that‚Äôs one of them so can you imagine the other things she started arguments about!!! stupid things. and i can‚Äôt do anything about it. i want to report her to a mental hospital is that possible? like call the mental hospital and tell them i have concerns for her because she fucking belongs there. I can‚Äôt believe that horrible people like her can just go about there day after doing and saying the most hurtful thing? do narcissists lack empathy? she only has empathy for animals or characters in TV shows. she hates me because i‚Äôm younger than her- someone told me it‚Äôs because i mirror how she was when she was younger and i remind her of herself? She‚Äôs always competing with me as well when i don‚Äôt think the exact same way as her ‚Äúsomethings wrong with me‚Äù apparently i‚Äôm a gaslighter too? i don‚Äôt think so. help me because  i‚Äôm either going to kill HER or she‚Äôs going to kill ME or i‚Äôm going to kill MYSELF. she‚Äôs threatened to kill me a few times but never acted  on it which makes me scared and she just came in my room before telling me ‚Äúyour going to go out and empty the dishwasher right now and clear the bench if you want your money‚Äù so i said i guess i‚Äôm not getting my money because i don‚Äôt to do anything for her after what she said and did. she‚Äôs really money greedy as well so she probably just wanted an excuse to not give it to me.

She is a stay at home mom to their two young children so has no income of her own. She is estranged from almost all of her family, and all of her relatives/friends live out of state. What pisses me off the most is that CPS has been involved with their family, but have not done anything because the kids are not being physically abused. They just made the husband (and my friend) go to therapy which has not helped. The husband has hit my friend/kicked her in the ribs, and is apparently still threatening to beat her regularly. CPS actually called me because she gave them my phone number as someone they could interview since she has no other close relationships here. I straight up told them that the husband is dangerous and my friend has no way to get out without financial support. They still have not helped her find any resources.

I have encouraged her to leave even if it meant going to a shelter. I have encouraged her to get a job to start squirreling away some money to leave, but she says she can‚Äôt afford childcare and any government assistance in that department takes too long to get. Plus the husband would just take any money she made if he knew she had a job. She claims that any of the local domestic violence resources have not been helpful. I understand that she feels very stuck in her situation but to be honest I think she hasn‚Äôt put much effort into making anything better for herself either.

I wish that I could offer her and her kids a place to stay temporarily but it‚Äôs just not a possibility.

I took to trial and the jury was hung,  2nd trial i was found guilty though I was the victim.    So much rests on he said / she said bullshit and she cries and plays vicim well so what else can I do?  

I haven't any proof other then the 5 people who watched it all and literally sat and said it didn't happen as she described. 

She continually stonewalls me and takes our son and disappears and refuse to even send a txt message what is going on.   Just removes him from school, disappears with him and calls 911 and says "" I""m scared""  and points to me.  Causing huge issues obviously.  

Resulting in weeks and months of court cases and warrants and outright abuse by this woman. 

  
What can a man do or turn to when dealing with delusional nonsense like this?  The police no matter what, point to me doing the wrong when i'm not.

1ie7tal,Help me confirm my suspicions re: bipolar ex,No_Celery9390,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ie7tal/help_me_confirm_my_suspicions_re_bipolar_ex/,"  
Many years ago, I dated a man who was bipolar (and unmedicated) but did not tell me until AFTER I fell for him. I ignored the red flags because he seemed \*so genuine\*.

He kept it together for the first several months and was very sweet, lots of love bombing. For my half birthday, he planned a special day-long date where we had a great time. This was right before a mutual friend was coming into town from across the country. We'd been counting down the days til he arrived, excitedly making plans for his visit. 

The day our friend arrived, my ex had a MASSIVE manic episode that was like a nitrogen bomb exploded, total Jeckyll & Hyde. He said it was because his ex was threatening child support isues. Our friend and I spent the entire week dealing with his tantrums and trying to talk him into getting help. He threw a tantrum at a restaurant with several of his own friends present, and we talked him down, but then he whispered insults only I could hear. Another night, he told an embarrassing story I had specifically asked him not to tell, then expected me to hold back his hair while he puked from stress.... I am still completely traumatized by that week and everything that followed. He claimed his episodes were usually not that bad, ie that was an outlier, and only happened once or twice a year. 

After that, he said he was getting treatment, and we got back together and broke up several times in the span of a few months. I never saw his sweet side again, except briefly while he was apologizing, then straight back to being a snarling asshole. All of a sudden, he claimed he had ""daily cycles"" that justified his outbursts all day every day, which does not match his earlier claim that the nitrogen bomb blast was an outlier. 

There was also an element of reproductive coercion that I only recognized as such very recently. Very early on and throughout our relationship, he was surprisingly casual about birth control for a grown, sexually experienced man who said he didn't want more kids. There was an unprotected sex incident, then he talked me out of 2 different types of BC. The last incident involved breakup sex where he broke our explicit agreement to pull out (while also wearing a condom). 

At the time, It was like the person I'd fallen for, who'd seemed so genuine, had died. At first, I believed his narrative -- that he was a sweet guy ""but for"" the bipolar, which took over him like a demon -- and I took him back many times as a result.

What I have realized in the past few weeks is that the following elements of his narrative do not add up:

\- He knew he was bipolar years before we met, but did not tell me until it was too late. At the time, I'd assumed he was embarrassed, or in denial. That doesn't make sense though; this had been going on for YEARS, and he'd had plenty of experience dating during that time. I'm pretty sure I met him right after a similar episode where he dumped a previous girlfriend. He knew exactly what was going to happen when we started dating. 

\- He knew his bipolar was severe and had gone to a crisis center at one point years prior. This makes it hard to believe his claim that the nitrogen bomb episode was an outlier. 

\- While we were dating, he did not want to take bipolar medications because of potential side effects. This is hard to believe, or at least simplistic, given the crisis center piece. I think he wanted to jerk me around and have an excuse for his tantrums. It also shows he had \*no intention\* of getting treatment and \*fully intended\* to jerk me around with the bipolar as cover. 

\- It strikes me as very odd that he arranged the daylong date right before his episode hit. He wanted to paint our day date as our last moment of peace in a ""star crossed lovers"" scenario of true love marred by mental illness. It's weird that he chose that instead of just saying he was about to have a breakdown. 
Edit: He referred back to that day date to get me back and get sympathy: ""I want you to remember me as the sweet guy who could make your half birthday the most magically perfect day -- not the unhinged slob I am today.""

\- What's weird too is that he never returned to that nice, sweet guy ever again except to apologize for various tantrums. If he really loved me with his real, sweet self, it seems he would have reverted back to normal and sought treatment once the mania subsided. 

\- I also question the ""randomness"" of his episode hitting the day our friend arrived. He'd known about our friend's plans for MONTHS but opted to blast us both with his unmitigated bipolar symptoms he knew about at least a day prior for our day date??? Fighting with his ex was not a new thing either, ie. was he really THAT upset over it, or was that a cover for his ruse:

I can't help but wonder if he planned the entire thing as a stunt to rope my friend into his bipolar narrative. If he could get me and everyone else convinced of that, he'd have an excuse to rail on me and get sympathy for it. It would also be more believable for me to actually have his child if I thought the sweet guy was in there somewhere. 

I guess I am just looking for backup on my conclusions. This has been hanging over my head for many years.  ",2025-01-31 05:30:05,2025-03-17 03:09:58,help

Not so much physically, she‚Äôs only hit my gf a few times in recent years.

But 100% emotionally and mentally. She‚Äôs been dependent on her mom for sure, so she‚Äôs kinda lived with the abuse for a while. Mind you, she has two baby girls and needs help a lot. So the mom was there to help her.

But the mom is psycho, and has told my gf to give up her two kids thousands of times. ‚ÄúJust sign the papers‚Äù she says every chance she gets. 

Now she‚Äôs going psycho and making false claims to CPS and getting the baby daddy to make threats as well (my gf already has full custody and a DVRO on the baby daddy). 

I am willing to have my gf and her two babies move in with me, but want to try to get a RO on the mom so she can‚Äôt harass us. One time they were over at my house and the girls were asleep but the mom didn‚Äôt want them sleeping at my house so she showed up at midnight pounding on the front door and demanded that we take the girls back‚Ä¶ 

My gf is scared. She thinks her mom actually could steal her kids (because of how much support the mom has given her and the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù of that support). She also thinks her mom will send someone to beat her up even if she gets the RO granted so ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù. 


I don‚Äôt know what to do. My gf has brought up getting an RO against her mom for 4+ months now, but I always had hopes the mom wouldn‚Äôt be so stupid. Today was a final straw because she opened a CPS case against us and contacted the baby daddy. Absolutely insane.

How do I get my gf to set aside her fears and take the next steps in removing her abuser from her life?? ",2025-02-28 08:39:06,2025-03-17 03:09:59,help

Although we have been together since we were 15. I tried to break up with him several times through high school and college, but was never successful through the years I've dealt with so much immaturity and disrespect. For instance, when I got pregnant at just 19 with her oldest daughter, he missed our ultrasound appointments to hang out with his friends. He has always prioritized video games over time with me or his children.

As we've aged into our 30s, I feel like we are growing apart. I haven't felt connected to him in years. I have resentment that I cannot explain where it comes from.

Our marriage grew stale. Our sexual relations diminished. There are many times I can recall not wanting to have sex but him forcing me to by throwing tantrums and treating terrible for the entire day if I did not comply.

He lost his job in July due to a work accident. He says that I was not there for him like a good wife should have been.

I have tried to separate from him 3 times this year (Feb, Aug and Nov). In November we got into an argument when he had been drinking. I tried to leave the house with my daughter (10F) and he stood between my door and car so I could not close the door. He was yelling and pushing my face away, grabbed my car keys and threw them into the woods. He took my phone and started punching it several times. My daughter was in the backseat and witnessed everything. She was terrified and called a friend at 2 AM and that friend woke up her mom.

I accepted my defeat since I no longer had my car keys or phone and decided to go back inside and pleaded with him to go bed. I laid my daughter down and he begged me to come outside with him. I complied. As I followed him down the hallway, I could see that he was holding a rifle. As we got to our den, we struggled over the rifle I was in tears, sobbing, and pleading with him. ""What are you doing?"".

He says this was the only way since he had laid hands on me earlier that evening by shoving my face. It was nearly a 20 minute standoff outside with me standing in from of the rifle. Him talking about hurting himself, and also apologizing for hurting me.

A few minutes after that, there was a knock at our front door. It was the police. They pulled us out separately to talk to us. I told them everything and he denied it all.

Because he refused to leave the home. I had to leave. My 10-year-old was able to go with me, but my three year-old had to stay. It broke my heart, but there was nothing that cops could do since he refused to let me take her.

I went back the next day.

Two weeks later, a similar incident occurred. This time my children were at my in-laws and we got into a fight again while he was drinking. My oldest had called crying wanting to come home, which she did frequent. She suffers herself from anxiety and depression. I told him I was leaving to get the kids, but had intentions to come home with them. On my drive to get them, he called me in a rage telling me to turn around. That if I did not come back for him, he would kill himself. He would blow his brains out, and my blood would be on his hands. I was so scared and knew that I could not bring my daughters back to that situation. I called the police and asked for a welfare check on my husband.

Long story short, he had a standoff with the police and was admitted to a psychiatric facility for four days.

I have not been back with him since and it's been nearly 2 months. He has not made it easy as he blames me for the way that he acted for things that I have done in my past in our relationship. One day, he will be seem to be making progress and respect my boundaries and the next he is losing his mind and calling me nonstop.

I am in therapy, working with a divorce coach and reading self help books. He has done nothing. He says that he is sober and blames all of his previous problems on alcohol, but I still see the same actions and lack of respect and boundaries in his sober self.

I feel like all of this is my fault. I have cheated in the past. Am I responsible for his actions? I have divorce papers that I have not signed because feel accountable. How do I move forward?",2024-12-22 22:16:21,2025-03-17 03:10:02,help

My mother and I have been giving her advice, but it seems like all the common ways to get out of this situation have been prevented already. For example, we have tried to get photo and video evidence by being in call with her when things happen, but her father shuts off her devices, and i mean he either powers them down or takes them out of the room. So, neither I nor she can collect video or audio evidence. We called the police for a wellfare check on her, but the moment he learned she was autistic, the officer began to disregard her. The most evidence we have is of a photo of a scar she has on her foot from being beaten as a child. When she was younger, child services were called because he had been locking her in the basement, but they left since he began behaving while they were there. We have reason to suspect her mother is either an enabler, or a former victim of her father's abuse. Her two younger siblings, 14F and 15F also like to bully her because she's autistic. They won't let her get a drivers license, and keep both her cards and her legal documents away from her.  I want to help, but it seems like every plan we try gets shot down in the worst of ways.

1iwjvx2,Wife‚Äôs Ex-Husband Abusing Current Partner. Help,LiteraryConstruction,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iwjvx2/wifes_exhusband_abusing_current_partner_help/,"Hello lovely sub-reddit! Hoping you can assist me with this sensitive topic, as my wife and I feel very caught in the middle and unsure how to proceed: 

Some background information: My wife and I have been together for two years. She has two children from a previous marriage (7 and 11). Her ex-husband has been with his partner for about the same amount of time that we‚Äôve been together. Custody is split 50/50 (week on/week off). The ex‚Äôs partner also has kids from a previous relationship (3 - ages 3, 10, and 14). My wife and I own a home together. The ex and his partner currently live at his house, but are planning to move soon. The co-parenting relationship between my wife and her ex, and between the four of us is contentious. We get along much between with the ex‚Äôs partner than we do with him, as he is a clinically diagnosed narcissist, with bi-polar disorder and severe anger management issues. Almost every joint decision is a struggle/fight, and it‚Äôs caused a lot of issues over the past few years. There is no formal parenting plan in place. 

The issue: Over the past year+, the ex‚Äôs partner has been secretly confiding in my wife and I that my wife‚Äôs ex is abusing her. It runs the gamut from yelling in her face, smashing dishes, punching holes in the wall, escalating to putting his hands on her (pushing, shoving), etc. He also sexually coerces her, treats her like she‚Äôs ‚Äúonly good for one thing‚Äù, tracks her phone location, spam texts her when she‚Äôs out of his sight ‚Äî the list is endless. These episodes happen as patterned behavior, cropping up about once every 2-3 months. He has allegedly gotten support through therapy and anger management classes, but clearly that‚Äôs all been a bunch of BS. The last time this happened (in late Sept) she said she was going to leave him‚Ä¶ and didn‚Äôt. She knows exactly what‚Äôs happening to her, agrees it‚Äôs not acceptable and doesn‚Äôt try to make excuses for his actions. We offer her support where we can, and always remind her if she needs help getting out, we would gladly do so without issue. 

She called my wife the other day and told us it happened again; this time with the kids present (which is a first to our knowledge). They were arguing after everyone went to bed, which culminated with him pushing her outside, and beating the crap out of her car hood/mirror. My step-daughter (11) heard the door slam, woke up and went outside, and caught the tail end of all of this. From what we were told, they walked her back inside, the ex‚Äôs partner calmed her down, reassured her she was ok and then left to cooldown (leaving her phone at the house so he couldn‚Äôt track her). The ex proceeded to spam text her threats of leaving the kids alone to come find her (which she shows my wife and I). She ended up staying at a friend‚Äôs house overnight, returning the following morning. 

Here‚Äôs where we‚Äôre looking for guidance ‚Äî what should our next steps be? 

- My step-daughter hasn‚Äôt mentioned anything about the event. She is extremely sensitive and we don‚Äôt want to pressure her into talking about it because we worry that when something happens to the ex (his partner leaves, custody changes, etc, she will blame herself). We also worry she will say something that‚Äôll make the ex realize that his partner has been talking to us and we don‚Äôt want to jeopardize her safety.  

 - We‚Äôve talked to the partner every day since the event and she‚Äôs told us he‚Äôs been ‚Äúvery apologetic‚Äù (as most abusers are) and has been on his best behavior. She has told us she‚Äôs leaving but unfortunately, we don‚Äôt believe her. 

- We do not believe he‚Äôd ever place a hand on the kids, but we don‚Äôt trust an incident like this won‚Äôt happen again which also constitutes child abuse.

- All we have is hearsay from the partner (plus all the evidence she‚Äôs shown us) so we feel stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to inserting ourselves. If we do a wellness check, there‚Äôs nothing actively happening at the house so we‚Äôre afraid they‚Äôll say ‚Äúeverything fine‚Äù and that‚Äôll be that

- If my wife and I seek legal counsel to get temporary full time custody, what evidence would need to be presented to substantiate that claim? Also we are worried if we do that, he‚Äôll take his anger out on his partner 10x worse if she stays

It just seems like there‚Äôs so many factors and we‚Äôd really appreciate anyone‚Äôs perspective on best next steps.

Hi I posted this yesterday but I got locked out of my account so had to come on on this one as I didn‚Äôt even see it I got any replies. 

So 8 months ago I had to ring the police he got arrested and we haven‚Äôt spoken since. Cops pursuing charges of controlling & coercive behaviour & assault. (Assault was not major, slight injury to my eye, affecting my sight, not permanently & wasn‚Äôt a visible injury) & locked me in wouldn‚Äôt let me leave, this lasted around half hour maybe less, until I got on to police emergency. He‚Äôs been violent before probably about 2 year ago, multiple times back then, pushing shoving spitting a bite, slaps ect, aggression such as smashing things etc. back then I‚Äôd be scared in the moment but more scared that he was ending it with me, because that‚Äôs what he‚Äôd be telling me, that he was done with me ect. Prior to recent assault it was all verbal & emotional, he said they were regular rows & I was the cause, I believed  this but my friends / family said it was abuse, I didn‚Äôt know what to think apart from feeling depressed hopeless useless & just sad & embarrassed that I‚Äôd turned him against me. He‚Äôd often try to be affectionate but I normally refused because either I‚Äôd worry I‚Äôd do something wrong & he‚Äôd get upset with me or he‚Äôd get angry if I wanted to get a drink or move for example (sometimes small things like that would really annoy him) he also said I didn‚Äôt spend enough time with him but I used to get worried about seeing him cause the arguments & how he would speak to me would get to me. I think over those things now & feel like I didn‚Äôt put enough effort in. Because I was always down and probably didn‚Äôt try but I‚Äôd find it hard to forget how he‚Äôd spoke to me or something & then me being quiet would cause more problems.  I felt I‚Äôd made the right decision 2 weeks after the assault, I kept remembering how scared I‚Äôd been & thought I need to stay away, now though I wake up crying about him, I have nightmares where I realise I‚Äôve lost him, I feel I‚Äôve thrown my future away. The love was real and makes me feel like I wish I‚Äôd stayed even though it was hard because it was my soulmate. I‚Äôve dropped charges with the police and reached out to him but he has ignored me. I have tried for the last months to block him out but I couldn‚Äôt keep lying to myself about how I feel, I wish he‚Äôd contact me. I am so so sad all of the time and don‚Äôt see it ever stopping. How will I ever know if it was abusive or if I was just a bad gf & drove him to those things.

I feel like breaking down even as I write this 


2 years and a few months ago I met a man and went down a whirl wind of a relationship and I am now broken and lost. Let‚Äôs call this man Steve. When I met Steve I was in my clinical year of PA school near the end. I had a few months left. Once I graduated I moved in with him and my father was dying of cancer. I was easy going at first but when the relationship first started he slept with an ex of his and he also had 3 kids by two different women. I was easy going. His sleeping with the ex hurt my heart because I liked him but we weren‚Äôt officially in a relationship so I knew it should not bother me. I was so easy going I even gave the mother of his youngest two kids, let‚Äôs call her Stephanie, medical advice was kind and offered for us to all move into a bigger home down the hill to raise the kids in an easier home. It was going well until he became secretive of his relationship with Stephanie and Stephanie started saying hurtful things about me like not wanting me around. I‚Äôll admit it. I became insecure. In hindsight the manipulation started from the moment he said hello

From early on in our relationship I was required to keep my location on. One day I had gotten lost and my car severely damaged and he had to come and find me and I was convinced it was a good thing he had my location. But I was not allowed to turn it off. When we first started dating I had to pass my boards and so he took care of me minimally for 3 months. And so after I passed my board I offered to do the same so he could go back to school to get his GED. He never did and I took care of the family for an entire year. Him me his kids and even my family. Everyone was getting every penny I had. Eventually the money going home stopped. I thought i was in control of my finances because the money was in my bank account but I ran every purchase by him and took on every expense. 

Things between him and Stephanie started to become hostile always fighting me and Steve are fighting it‚Äôs so much fighting. I‚Äôm super insecure now because I‚Äôm starting to love Steve and I want to build a family with him. I work hard. I work incredibly hard. I move me Steve and his 3 kids (one who lived with us full time) from a 1900 square feet house into one closer to 4,000 I wanted his kids to have everything I never did. I loved them so much. I made and stocked a playroom so they could have a place to go to entertain themselves and keep their toys. And stocked it with art supplies for the oldest daughter. For a little bit things were okay. Then the younger kids started telling me of threats their family was making to me physical wellbeing they were calling into our home talking to the oldest daughter talking about me. I got angry with Steve and told him to fix the problem he refused to fix it in front of me and said he fixed it one day but I didn‚Äôt believe him. The arguments started to escalate Stephanie became more and more disrespectful I became more and more insecure. And Steve became more and more disrespectful. 

Steve told me things like he wishes it was the olden days where he could beat women without consequence. And that all women were good for was reproduction (knowing I was having a hard time getting pregnant and we were trying for a baby). He told me I needed to much attention and should marry a women. The arguments started become worse. Steve started to make fun of my mental health. When we first got together I was on meds for bipolar disorder but I don‚Äôt think I was bipolar a psychiatrist I never knew asked me a question and I said sometimes I‚Äôm sad sometimes I‚Äôm not and they said boom you‚Äôre bipolar so I got off the meds. Steve started calling me a lunatic and insane and really beating me down mentally. I started getting high in marijuana to tolerate the behaviors and that made everything okay because I was passive and would not engage in any arguments. But on the weed I started getting paranoid about Steve. I felt dark energy around him and was so scared I went to a tarot reader who told me everything was going to be okay (I won‚Äôt dive into this story line right now) 

Fast forward in April of this year we fought and had a bad argument on his daughters birthday and made up he told me before we left the park while he kids were riding rides he would start hitting me. I was stupid and thought he was lying. I didn‚Äôt believe he would actually do it. I would be lying to you guys if I told you I remember the first time he ever hit me or how we got to the point of physically fighting all the time. But the fights got bad. One time in June I thought I was pregnant we went to a party I wanted to go home and we got into a fight by the end of the fight he had beat me so bad I had bruises all over my body. Then he sexually assaulted me for good measure. 

I‚Äôm not going to lie. He had sexually assaulted me before but I was too in love to call it that. I thought it was a man forcing a connection in the only way he knew how. He wasn‚Äôt rough at first he just kept going despite me saying no pushing him and crying through the whole thing.  But this time he was forceful. I noticed he was recording me in my anger but not him beating me so after he beat me so bad I had bruises and had to call off of work I met with a police officer who lied and said I could file a report just for paperwork purposes. I filed the report and long story short they arrested him I bailed him out and then like a coward lied and said I told a friend who made the report. After that things got worse. I never fought back after that. I had to much guilt over what I done and knew fighting wasn‚Äôt the way. He sexually assaulted me weekly if not almost daily. He beat me tried to break my hand and my jaw. Tried to choke me intentionally until I passed out. Told me he liked sexually assaulting me and that it was easier to take it. Told me when I misbehaved he wished to anally r**** me until I bled and he didn‚Äôt care if I had pain. 

One day we got into another fight over how he was treating his oldest daughter. She was so lonely. And I loved her so much she just wanted him to love her. Well he didn‚Äôt like that he yelled at her about the argument then told her he would kill me if she told me what he said. She got scared told her aunt who called CPS. She then called CPS and then told me. I then had to call CPS because I was a mandated reporter. And I left because of her. I left because I loved her and he was arrested again and I knew I couldn‚Äôt go back home. Whenever I had tried to leave in the past he would always use the kids against me. I knew my career was in jeopardy. I was so close to getting my doctorates degree and I knew I couldn‚Äôt survive there much longer. His daughter was starting to see and hear the abuse. We were both so scared. 

I left in July of this year. When I left he tried to extort me for money then tried to have me arrested for violating my own no contact Order

I write this to say why do I still wish he will come back? Why am I like a dog sitting in my home waiting to its owner to come back. I can‚Äôt have intimacy with anyone else. He made me tell him I was his property during sex one time and I did it. Like an idiot I did it. I know it‚Äôs a trauma bond f*#^ I know but why. 

He‚Äôs not coming back is he :(?

I‚Äôm so sick in the head. You guys have no idea how many people have sexually abused me since I left. I was scared because he said he would kill me if I left so I let another man spit in my mouth and force my into sex for protection. I then made friends with another guy who said he was working through trauma and he date raped me at a party with 4 of his friends. I am so broken I won‚Äôt even think about those things. I‚Äôm still stuck with Steve in that house. I mentally can‚Äôt process anything else. If I think about it. I start thinking bad things about my worth In this world 

I wish I could make everything stop. I work overtime every week because I can‚Äôt sleep and I can‚Äôt stop thinking of Steve. Please. Please help me. ",2024-12-05 04:43:30,2025-03-17 03:10:15,help

There‚Äôs been issues since the beginning but being dumb I overlooked them.. this is only my second relationship ever. We were long distance at first, he traveled to meet me and then I traveled to see him a month later, he fell on hard times and I stupidly allowed him to stay with me and my parents back in June. He was at our house a few months before my mother put him out & he went to a homeless shelter in my city where‚Äôs he been living ever since. As I said theres been issues in the relationship already as far as countless arguments, name calling, controlling behavior etc. It started getting physical back in July. We‚Äôve had at least 4  physical altercations in the past 8-9 months. A few days ago we went to the bar together. I got up to use the bathroom and when I came back there was another man sitting quite close to him but he was talking to the bartender so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I sat down and my boyfriend kept telling me to move over but I thought he was being funny so I didn‚Äôt. The man at the bar started arguing with everyone my boyfriend included. My boyfriend then started getting more aggressive with the man AND ME, calling me a bitch and saying he‚Äôll slap me in front of everyone. We left like 10-15 mins later. He said I wasn‚Äôt on his side and was trying to get attention from the other men and kept talking about how bad he would‚Äôve beaten the man in the bar.. as we‚Äôre walking to my house he‚Äôs talking shit to me and I‚Äôm trying to ignore him. He eventually hits me in the back of my head while standing in front of me trying to prevent me from going another way. He walked the whole way home about 4 blocks just hitting me. Pulling my hair.. pushing me.. actually ended up pushing me down to the ground in the snow and mud and when I said it was over he snatched my purse and my phone. Covered my mouth and tried to choke me multiple times so I wouldn‚Äôt scream and draw attention. Said I was tryna get him in trouble. It was midnight at that point. I tried to get him an uber home but he refused so I just kept the peace and let him stay until the next day.. I grew up seeing my mother deal with domestic violence and now I‚Äôm going through the same thing. I just want him to move back to his home state because as long as he‚Äôs here and as long as I‚Äôm the only person he knows out here I‚Äôm going to feel responsible for him. He also hasn‚Äôt gotten a job or an apartment in the 9-10 months he‚Äôs been here so I‚Äôve been supporting him financially as well. How do I leave?? What do I do??

1i3lvtt,How do I help my friend.,Square_Classroom3076,2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1i3lvtt/how_do_i_help_my_friend/,"Okay so my best friend cut all contact with me over 8 years ago after dating this guy for about a year or so, then she got back in touch last year, I was still hurting so I didn't talk to her much then in about October she started to tell me how bad it was and how abusive he was, emotional and physical violence, he tried to strangle her multiple times and she was on the high risk of death list with the police. I even heard him abusing her, I helped her and she told me she had somewhere safe to go once we get her out. She was sleeping with a door wedge and against the door incase he tried to get to her in the night. Anyway we got her out with the help of police and she looked ao emaciated and scared, she practically collapsed into my arms. So her safe place turned out to be her ex's house and it turns out she never told me how controlling and belittling he was and is now even worse, so we are currently working on getting her to stay at my place as soon as she has somewhere safe for her dog to stay (we are limited by space and also have disabled cats and bunnies). We have a protection order out so he can't contact her and he is going to be charged as she documented quite a bit of evidence and sent me everything. I'm also giving evidence about what I witnessed.

Anyway,
She still talks about how much she still loves her abuser and how there were good times too and she misses him, how it was a lot of his autism that maybe made him so sadistic. How people have told her he has turned his life around now and while he used to drink about 2 liters of vodka a night he has now quit drinking completely which I find hard to believe in such a short space of time. I feel like he is putting on a show for everyone so he can get her back. It's like she is brainwashed. I don't know how to help her. Can anyone please offer any tips or advice. She quite likes to look into/research and watch documentaries about things like psychopaths as we both think he is a genuine psychopath. She text me last night and said this,
""I do love him and want to support him. he did awful things and my eyes are open but it never seemed as bad as others, because he seemed as scared of himself as me and we both didn't understand how to fix""

I am honestly terrified that she will go back and I will loose her again. I don't know if I can watch her make herself ill as she makes him her everything which is what happened at the start and he strung her along for a year and he said he had moved in with his parents as he was living in a house with his ex and then we caught him still living there, then he would say he would see her that day and not come and he even did this on Christmas day, I of course rushed over and picked up the pieces and brought her to mine for Christmas. 
I just feel so helpless when she talks like this and I don't know how to help her realise that he was always abusive, every time she cried he said it made him love her a degree less ect. I could go on but I don't want this to be even longer.
I appreciate anyone's help and thank you for reading my post. 
Thank you again.
If you have any questions I will do my best to respond but I may forget to, if I do I'm sorry in advance.

I never said anything like that, nor own any firearms. She then told her local court and my local court the same thing ( she lives in North Carolina and I live in Colorado, I haven't seen her in person for years) and they granted her a protection order. The school banned me from campus. I've never had any legal issues in my life besides a speeding ticket when there was a wildfire burning near my rents'house. 

While I know this forum is for victims of actual domestic violence, I need help at this point from a community like this because I really didn't say anything like it and I was taking the last class I needed to graduate from college, but I was banned from the school due to her word of mouth alone. 
I then lost my job at UPS too because they deliver to the school and because they didn't like the RO. 

There was another school shooting in the state a few days before this.
I understand the school and the courts did the right thing back then but I still have no idea why my ex did any of this. 

Because I was banned from campus and lost my job, and also because she's never ever done anything even remotely like this I couldn't believe it was really her doing it. I subsequently ignored the restraining order, to say that I never threatened to shoot anyone and asked her why she did this. Perhaps I was scammed or something in a very terrible way. I did not use any aggressive language, I just wanted to know why and/or how to fix this. She immediately filed a police report in both states that I contacted her, and I was arrested that night. I learned how to bond out of custody but then still tried to contact her again because my professors literally were rushing their kids back to their car when I walked out of walmart. She reported that I contacted her again I was arrested again.
 I then tried to contact her again and was arrested again. This went on for the last year basically. I kept violating the order because I couldn't and still can't believe she would do something like this. I was held in jail until I plead guilty to a dvpo violation and stalking (because I kept violating the order) I never got mad at her I just wanted her to undo this so I can have my own life back and have no idea what is going on on her end. I eventually found out she had started dating another guy before she ghosted me. She also filed all her stuff through a domestic violence nonprofit. They are acting off of her word of mouth and that I violated the ex parte order at all, even though the order was from her word of mouth too. 

I'm a biotechnology major and literally haven't even known anyone else in my life that has had an RO placed on them. 
I am posting this because I really have been telling the truth to the courts and school, but they keep choosing to believe her word of mouth over mine, I think because she reported all this as a domestic violence issue, so that gets both the court and the school's priority and support. My heart goes out to those people that are really suffering from domestic violence. I loved her though and have never done anything to her and she seemed happy with me. I have no idea what to do now. 
I don't want to try to legally fight this because I don't want to hurt actual domestic violence victims' efforts to get help in a system that already isn't always supportive of them. I know that people lying to the court about these things just makes it harder for other people to get restraining orders. I am so at a loss as to what to do ",2024-12-26 03:52:13,2025-03-17 03:10:24,help

I am really in need of help and community so here goes nothing. Been with my wife since teenagers and loved and lived for 16 years, married 6 years. Both of us were really stressed with Covid and since then things have been rocky. The violence started about 3 years ago, slaps and grabs escalating to chocking me where I started seeing black a year and a half ago. Not as bad since but always returning no matter the promises. I‚Äôm so ashamed and feel so weak that I let it get this far and go on so long. So many times I said THIS is the last time. Well this month she pushed my mom down the stairs, something about seeing someone else get hurt that finally made me see. 
Her past traumas are so deep and dark, truly horrific shit (not that mines not bad, but hers is worse and the ‚Äúreason‚Äù for the violence). I can‚Äôt reconcile in my head that I am the only one who‚Äôs ever been there for her, given her my love and life and everything. Somehow the narrative became that I was controlling and forced many aspects of the relationship against her will. Our careers, finances, all our choices she was there, actively participated and made decisions with me.

How can she not see that her violence makes me act against mine (can‚Äôt emotionally support her b/c frankly I‚Äôm afraid if I try to hold her she‚Äôll hit me).
Are there any men or women who have had such a deep and long love flip like that? I have been hearing her feel trapped in the relationship for sometime, how does that translate to beating me like a dog? Or how she thinks the lightbulb flickering is ghost communication? I‚Äôve been the only one for sometime long to help her, after I walked away I‚Äôm so scared she doesn‚Äôt even know these things are issues to address :(

I am a late 20s male. My friend Emily is late 30s female who was having an affair with an older male Jake. Her bf is Ryan who is around her age and they have been together for as long as I've known them.

Background

I met Emily through work a few years ago. I don't work there anymore but we've kept in touch and I now work a slow retail job. She visits me at work and sometimes we hang out in the back room playing games and talking. Sometimes she would bring Ryan with her but in the past few months he hasn't come and it's only been her. We talk about a lot of stuff but since Ryan hasn't been coming she seems to have opened up to me more. When we worked together Ryan would come visit. But we all noticed at work that sometimes he was a little aggressive with her and rude. He started to visit her at work more and more often until I left. I'm don't know how much he visits her now but she still works there part time while working somewhere else full time. Emily is a gem of a person. Generally upbeat always willing to give a helping hand and overall a nice person. When nobody is looking though you can tell how she feels just by looking at her face. I don't agree with her affair but I don't judge her for it.

When Emily does come visit. I'm mostly a listener and I give my opinion at the end. From the stories it sounded like Ryan was getting more and more controlling. I grew up in this sort of situation. I started to notice that she would be in pain a lot. She never said anything but I'd notice she'd flinch when she gets up. She'd have a slight limp sometimes or be holding her body in a weird way. IYKYK. She always had a story on how she slipped on the ice or how her dog knocked her over or some excuse. It worked for a little while as her stories all seemed possible. She started to say how she didn't want to be home so I told her that she's always welcome to visit at my store as we're open late and I even offered for her to come visit at my place with my roommates whenever I'm not working. The last couple months she hasn't visited as often and I just assumed that things were improving at home. Recently when she visits I've noticed her wearing makeup. She kept saying she was going out to events to meet new people and be more social. She's not a makeup person. But, then she started to wear makeup when i knew she was coming from work that's when I started to suspect. She said that she had been seeing someone named Jake. Since I didn't know how long she'd been seeing him I thought maybe it was him hurting her because the timing fit but she seemed happier. I know her private tastes are more on the rougher side so I told myself it was that. But she left her phone on the table unlocked one time when she went to the bathroom. I knew she was messaging Jake on and off so I took her phone and went into the app she talked to him on. He was the only contact so I took a picture of his info with my phone and put it back before she came back. I know this was a huge breaking of trust but I'm generally worried about her.

Lately her visits to me increased. So did her makeup. I asked how things are with Jake and she just said she wasn't seeing him anymore. Then why are her injuries increasing? If she's not seeing him then they should have stopped not gotten worse. It clicked. It's Ryan. Emily already has formed a plan to leave Ryan in a few weeks time. What caused the sudden increase. I dug a little and found out that in her fun times with Jake he had left a hickey. She tried to hide it from Ryan but he saw it. She blames herself because she feels guilty about the affair and she let Jake do it to her. But Jake knew she has a bf. To this point Emily has not admitted to Ryan being physically abusive towards her.

How I messed up

I sat with this info for a while but I went into my own rage about it yesterday. I downloaded the app that Emily talked to Jake on. I sent him a long message of what I suspect is going on. Then I deleted the app so I couldn't get a response. I don't know what I was thinking. What do I really expect him to do? They're not even a thing anymore. But he put a hickey on Emily which made her problems so much worse. I wanted him to know what his irresponsibility had done to her. Even if she says it's her fault it's his fault too. Well I guess Jake messaged her. She's mad at Jake for messaging she's mad at me for violating her privacy and getting involved. She says that I don't know what's going on and she's right. I'm mad at myself for getting involved but I couldn't sit by and do nothing if something worse were to happen to her. I'm mad at myself because now I took away what safe space she had with me. I want her to be able to be there for her if she needs me.

Now what do I do? I know they met on this site and I want him to see it as I didn't give much details in the message. But that's getting too involved again.

TL;DR I found out that my friend was having an affair that ended. I broke into her phone to get his contact info because I thought it was him being violent to her. But, it's most likely her bf. I contacted her affair guy behind her back. Now she's mad at me for getting involved but I want her to be ok.",2025-02-28 19:45:24,2025-03-17 03:10:28,help

My father has a problem with both alcohol and drugs. My mother and my father argue on a daily basis, so, for the sake of my mental health, i said i wouldn't get involved in their fights anymore. Yet, i'm afraid, because i know what they're both capable of when they argue. A few weeks ago, my mother threatened to kill herself, and she just wouldn't listen to a word my father said, so i obviously had to step in to prevent her from doing anything we would all regret. For this same reason, i have very bad anxiety problems, i can't sleep at night, thinking they'll start arguing any time soon, and what's even more horrific is that when they fight they ignore eachother. That isn't exactly the bad part, because that means there's no chance for fighting when they don't even speak to eachother, but the bad part is that they start talking and loving eachother again after a few days or weeks; meaning i can't have peace when that happens, because i know they'll start arguing again eventually. I've told my mother to leave the house, both of us, and she agrees, yet it all feels like an empty promise, because when she and my father sort things out between them, she forgets everything she says about leaving, and i'm condemned to stay here, knowing the cycle will repeat. I don't know what to do, i can't get a job to buy a plane ticket to go live with my sister, since where I live, minors can't work. This has taken a toll on my mental health, and i've considered ending my life in repeated occasions because of this.

I have spent all my savings on attorneys fees. During the temporary orders, my ex was told to bring my son to me asap (my ex kicked me out and refused to let me take my son) then my ex had my son for 3 days. When he brought him back to me, his face was bruised so badly.
For his 2 year check up, my son‚Äôs doctor confirmed that his mental development has DECLINED since his last visit (even before he kicked me out, he was not letting me near my son and was snatching him out of my arms). I‚Äôm in the state of Texas. We were never married. I‚Äôm so worried about my son and don‚Äôt want him to become another statistic.

1fuzjqp,I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm exaggerating things. Help pls,Other_Hall3539,8,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1fuzjqp/i_dont_know_if_im_exaggerating_things_help_pls/,"I (44/F) and my husband (44/M) got married about 18 months ago. This is the first marriage for both of us.

I‚Äôve never posted before on reddit, and this whole issue makes me feel sick to my stomach. I truly don‚Äôt even know what to say. Or whether I should post at all. Terrified is the main feeling. And guilt about causing my husband pain. 

I got married about a year and a half ago. I always assumed marriage was for life- that you just work on it and fix it as it bends, and hope it doesn‚Äôt break. 

There‚Äôs many issues. His anger for one. The way he speaks to me when unhappy. My way of catering to his displeasure, and willingness to do anything to avoid him being ‚Äúirritated‚Äù (ie angry) or upset. 

We have many differing values that clash. 
Some which put my job at risk- which is a huge deal for me.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. 
My parents are rather conservative but are absolutely wonderful people- they are loved for all they do for others. I absolutely adore them. 

I let slip some issues when I was really struggling and they are now kind of against my husband. I haven‚Äôt even told them most of it. 

My dad has suggested I take 3 months to try and sort the issues out between my husband and myself. But they are really unhappy with how he‚Äôs treated me at times so far. 

And I have to say it is at times- sometimes he‚Äôs lovely and caring and sweet. And I do love him. And the thought of breaking his heart really hurts. He has no clue I‚Äôd consider separating at all. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm doing stupid stuff like looking up toxic relationships quizzes and how to tell if you should work on it or leave? 

Please any questions I‚Äôll answer. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I‚Äôm 44 and he‚Äôs the same age. We knew each other at school but only recently reconnected. We both were in very toxic relationships prior to this. 

We seem to clash on different morals and values. For example:

I value financial security - he does not. He‚Äôs happy to live paycheck to paycheck which means we often borrow from his parents which leaves us behind for the following pay week. 
He is also quite verbally abusive in the workplace (my workplace also but we work in different sectors). He will steal things from work when he feels he is ‚Äúowed‚Äù or ‚Äúwronged‚Äù which I disagree with. 

He gets quite angry over various things - whenever anything‚Äôs ‚Äúin his way‚Äù he throws it but gets angry when I keep trying to tidy up so it doesn‚Äôt happen. He gets angry if I put his clean clothes away wrong or if the dog‚Äôs in his way, unfortunately the dog cops a lot of his anger/frustration. 

He is very verbally abusive when things go wrong with people - for example he will threaten restaurants if they get a delivery order wrong. But it‚Äôs not just that - he will actually tell them he will violate their children and wife if they don‚Äôt fuck off/do what he wants. It‚Äôs awful.

Hello, I‚Äôm (21F)  keeping myself anonymous for my safety and I‚Äôve also never done anything like this before, but I‚Äôm struggling to turn to anybody else as I feel like nobody understands or knows what to say.
So to sum it up, I‚Äôve recently got out of what I think was an abusive relationship and it‚Äôs not the first time I have been with him  (34M) and I should have learnt from last time but he told me things would be different but they weren‚Äôt I now realize. 
We broke up due to me having to have an abortion after falling pregnant as I‚Äôm not personally ready to have a child and the decision just wasn‚Äôt right for me at the time, he then went on to saying awful things like I decided without telling him, and I‚Äôm being stupid and my ‚Äòexcuses‚Äô aren‚Äôt good enough and I‚Äôm at my ‚Äòprime age‚Äô and I‚Äôd be ‚Äòready in 9 months‚Äô and I went and did it anyway after talking to him several times. He then threatened to come to my door and proceed to tell me if his friend found out what I did they‚Äôd set my house on fire and it just got worse. I then blocked him and have been trying to live as normal but it‚Äôs just so hard as I‚Äôm getting constant calls on no caller ID alongside voicemails and he‚Äôs coming into my work telling me I need to grow up and I shouldn‚Äôt be hurting its him that‚Äôs hurting as he‚Äôs had ‚Äòeverything taken‚Äô from him, and calls me disgusting etc. 

So from here I‚Äôm at a loose end on what to do as it still feels like he has so much control over my life and me and my mood, and I‚Äôm scared to go to work as he constantly comes in. I was looking into Clares law and doing a check but I don‚Äôt know if I fit the criteria with him being a now ex. 
I just don‚Äôt know where to turn and I‚Äôm paranoid all the time and it‚Äôs just so hard. I didn‚Äôt notice the signs or maybe became numb to them and now it‚Äôs too late and I feel so guilty and ashamed for letting this happen. And I‚Äôm so upset because I let him in and I feel like he‚Äôs just used it all against me,  I just need some guidance. 
Thank you.

I am reaching out to this community for help and guidance during one of the most challenging times of my life. I am in a toxic and abusive marriage where I am subjected to verbal, physical, emotional, and financial abuse. Despite the pain and fear, I am determined to leave this situation and rebuild my life, but I feel trapped and uncertain about my next steps.

I am a doctor pursuing my USMLE and working toward my career in the medical field. However, my situation is complicated as I am on a dependent visa and unemployed. My husband is my main sponsor, and my career and immigration status are deeply tied to him. This dependency makes it incredibly difficult for me to leave, but I know I must for my safety and future.

I am reaching out to ask for advice, resources, and support with the following:

1. **Shelter and Basic Needs**: I urgently need a safe place to stay and access to resources for food and basic necessities. Are there organizations or shelters that support women in abusive situations, especially those on dependent visas?
2. **Financial Assistance**: As an unemployed dependent, I have no savings. Are there programs, charities, or community resources that provide temporary financial aid or help individuals like me find work?
3. **Divorce and Legal Guidance**: I want to understand how to proceed with divorce without jeopardizing my visa status. Are there legal protections or pathways for someone in my situation to remain in the country and continue pursuing my career? I am also seeking affordable or pro-bono legal services for support.
4. **Support for My Career**: My dream is to complete my USMLE and establish myself in the medical field. Are there resources or organizations that assist women in abusive situations to continue their education and careers?
5. **Experiences and Encouragement**: If anyone has faced a similar situation, your experiences, advice, or even words of encouragement would mean so much to me.

I feel overwhelmed and scared, but I am determined to find a way forward. This community has always been a source of support and strength, and I am hopeful that someone here can guide me in the right direction.

Thank you for reading this and for any help you can provide.",2025-01-23 04:50:33,2025-03-17 03:10:37,help

He follows me from room to room even when I ask for space and refuses to provide space for me and insists I keep having a conversation when I‚Äôve told him over and over to stop, take a break, I‚Äôm at capacity, overwhelmed, can‚Äôt go on. I am level 1 autistic with severe ADHD and struggle with emotional regulation and the constant following sends me into a trigger response, when he doesn‚Äôt let up I snap, then that makes everything worse because he feels like he needs to protect me or something, and it usually ends with me having to leave the house(mostly on days he works I stay and just keep going from room to room because we have kids and obviously I can‚Äôt leave them). Usually this happens in mornings before he‚Äôs going to work. He will be late to work to continue to seek me out. 

Once he leaves for work, he will spend the entire day texting me about how he fucked up how he feels so bad he realizes the gravity of the situation. He literally gets it, he understands he validates, he‚Äôs not just trying to appease me. He‚Äôs not just trying to get me to stop having my feelings he literally will sit and have a conversation with me pretty much the entire day and take full accountability for everything and talk through with everything.

But then he comes home and even if I‚Äôve clearly stated that I need space or time or I‚Äôm not ready to have a conversation with him he always bitter and resentful and angry that he spent the whole day having a terrible day because of me. And I don‚Äôt wanna talk about what happened. I‚Äôm not validating him. I‚Äôm not a support person for him . From my perspective, I feel like I am being put through it and use as a punching bag then immediately turned around and expected to be a support beam. He starts laying on the guilt how he‚Äôs miserable and sorry and he‚Äôs the worst person in the world and I‚Äôm the only person that‚Äôs there for him the only person he can be vulnerable to.

I can‚Äôt handle this anymore and I feel like there‚Äôs a name for this, but I can‚Äôt figure out what it is. I don‚Äôt know how to google it every time I Google it it just send me the national domestic violence help line. It doesn‚Äôt feel right it doesn‚Äôt feel OK.

I told her I was with my boyfriend (25M) and that we definitely can, he just needed to drive because I struggle driving at night. On the way there, I knew that my bestie and her boyfriend (26-28 M not sure 100% on his age) had gotten into an argument at the bar and she just wanted to leave. I asked her if she wanted to go to her mom‚Äôs and she told me she wanted to get her car which was at his place. Once we picked her up, she was drunk and said she was going to stay with him. When we got towards his house he tried to call her and she didn‚Äôt answer because we were close anyways. I didn‚Äôt realize he had left her at the bar, I thought she just wanted to go home which immediately made me anxious. Before she left, she wanted to show my boyfriend and I something funny on her phone. Out of no where I look up, and her boyfriend got into his car and started driving it super fast head first at my car and essentially boxed us in where we were parked so we couldn‚Äôt just drive off and leave. He came incredibly close to hitting it with maybe an inch or two gap between our cars. My friend got out of the car to talk to him, my boyfriend locked the car doors, and then her boyfriend got out of his car and started screaming at everyone. Thank god my boyfriend had locked the car doors too because he tried to open them on my side then his and was pulling on the door handles and just saying a lot of rude stuff, which I can‚Äôt even fully remember because I was so anxious I almost threw up. My boyfriend put my car in reverse to try to maneuver around his car which he ended up moving after my friend told him she would bust his windshield open if he didn‚Äôt leave us alone. Apparently he thought that she was hanging out with another man because he had no clue that the man in the car was my boyfriend but he was acting irrational.

I messaged my friend today to let her know I‚Äôm here if she needs to talk, and that I love her to pieces, but that I can‚Äôt be caught in the cross fires. I feel like it put my safety at risk as well as my boyfriend‚Äôs. I was super nice over the text to emphasize I‚Äôm still there for her I just don‚Äôt want to get stuck in the middle of it again because it was terrifying.

Her boyfriend has a huge temper, a drinking problem, and has beat the crap out of her repeatedly. I feel bad telling her that I can‚Äôt really help her out in those situations but all I could think of last night was what if her boyfriend had a weapon, hurt me or my boyfriend, damaged my car, etc the list goes on and on.

This is so unbelievably hard and heartbreaking for me to write but the final straw happened this morning and I am scared.

I have been with my partner for 6 years..although he did abandon me during the pandemic while pregnant. He had a breakdown and i stupidly took him back..
We spend the last three years on the outside looking like we were living our best lives. Travelling with our daughter and making so called great memories when in reality i have been living life on a knifes edge.

He has always suffred with his mental helth and anger. I just spent so long focussing on the good and mking plans for iur future but i cannot take any more.

He gaslights me, shouts at me and my daughter, calls both of us names, puts me down, calls me useless, comes out with a number of threats. He has also been physical with me a few times. Grabbed my arm so hard it bruised for weeks, slaps round the head and today he kicked my hip and leg so hard it went dead. Any occasion..xmas, birthdays, he kicks off. 

He always blames me, there is always an excuse and is always everyone else never taking accountability form his actions.

This morning was just horrendous.
Last night my daughter 3 was unwell with a fever so i let her in the bed with me..he stayed on her bed. We all share a room. He woke up ranting at how pathetic i was and how bad his back was from no sleep on the bed. He went off at me and made me and my daugher cry all because she was in the bed unwell with me. I was turning the light on to look for some things and he came at me, through a chair across the room and kicked me in the leg calling me a fat C***t.

He has the nastiest toungue. He says vile things. My dad is mine and my daughters world and the abuser goes straight for the jugular saying the most horrific things he would do to my dad if i try to leave or take our daughter away. I cannot take it anymore. My heart breaks for the jekyll and hyde i live with..it is like two people but i cannot have my daughter growing up around this. 

I have started my own business online recently but not making any money as of yet. He pays for everything while i have been raising our child and running our lives. He likes to throw the fact that i have no money and in his words have amounted to nothing when in actual fact i have had enough in my life happen that would break most ( child abuse, 8 years sober, PTSD,Panic dissorder spouse abuse, family and business loss ) he used to be my praiser and now he is vile. He makes me miserable. 
I have been there when he was ready to unalive himself and yet my life and emotions mean nothing.

I don't know what to do. We are in the uk, I have no escape plan, no money, i am terrified. He is here 247 at the moment. My daughter is with me unwell and i just want to feel safe.

I do believe  that if we leave my dad is at a real risk. Other half has recently confessed to a few things to his past and what he has done and i believe him. He scares me. I feel so trapped and i want out. I cannot take anymore. I just want to be happy with my baby..he is dark and violent. Saying I will be feeding my dad through a straw if we leave.

She is a single mother, not working, on welfare. She's very troubled from past childhood trauma and everyone in my family knows she's unstable. She's very mean and spiteful to her children specifically my niece. The younger children are all boys and has a different relationship with my sister. My niece as a preteen is really struggling. She uses my niece as free child care, telling her she is not able to go to school because she needs to help her around the house. My niece and the other children are fearful of her and always afraid to get into trouble, so I know she is also physically violent toward them. My niece is almost 13 living on a matress on the floor, no tv, no access to music, no phone to contact relatives. I know electronics are not needed, but it feels as if it is more of punishment to not give her access to ""nice things"". My niece spent Christmas with us, but when we brought her home she cried because she so badly did not want to live in my sisters house. She was scared.  And I don't know what to do. Everyone knows it's a horrible situation and I'm really fearful for her. I have reported my sister to child services twice over the years. I  am in my 20s and live across the country and dont know if I can or should do anything else. Other members of my family know the problem and recognize it but only see it as a ""sad situation"" & ""nothing They can do"". They either don't have the time or resources to take on an 13 year old with development issues and deslexia. They also don't want to tell the law about a ""family matter"".  I want to report it, I want to help, but I am in school across the country and cannot take her at the moment or else I would. I don't want to report it and she have no where to go if removed. 

Any thoughts on if/who I should contact in this case? Speaking to my sister will not work, that has been tried and only causes her to be spiteful and retaliate against the kids for speaking up. I really want to help. I feel like I need to get her out of the situation before something truly bad happens. I don't think anyone in my family has the capacity for a legal battle.

I am not allowed to get my license, a job, my mother moved us to the middle of no where, I am not allowed a debit card, I do not have nor known my security card, I have to eat food, shower, and sleep at correct times (with exceptions of my mother being distracted), I haven't had a doctor check up in years, I do not get adequate dental care, I can't make friends, I'm not allowed to walk down or in the next aisle from my mother, I grew up with little to no friends, my life was a tiny bit less isolated for a very short period and I was with my partner and best friend. Then, my family isolated me from my partner. They made up a lie which was proven false. The truth was my mother didn't find him attractive or thought he had enough money, she wants me to date a man she finds attractive. They told me I could still talk to him and be his friend. I became very depressed, but never disrespected my family due to it. Then they forced an intervention and told me I will stop ""looking sad"" and ""being too quiet"" for over a year, I've been forced to smile and pretend to be happy even in my own room. Now, I saw my partner out in public. I was with a friend, my parents knew where I was. I was so happy, I hugged him and talked and held his hands as I spoke to him. My mothers older coworkers recorded me and sent it to her. She got me and threatened me in the car. She threatened to hurt him, told me I am dead to her, that I will never get my license, and I stayed respectful as I could. But it terrified me. I came home and cried in fear. My grandmother and grandfather threatened to physically hurt him as well to my face and I am terrified I am next. I have tried to get in contact with the 2 adults who haven't failed me, my counselors. My mother forced me out last night to a baseball game where her coworkers played, she got me alone and with a wicked smile told me horrible threats, that I have until this weekend to choice them or him, and then that if she wants to, she can shut off my phone. Problem there is I am already in close to total isolation and if they do that, I will be trapped fully. None of my friends, my counselors, anyone can contact me or me to them. I am so petrified, I can't sleep or eat. I do not know what to do, and honestly I'm praying they are bluffing to make me coward down and say ""yes I'll stay with you all forever and never leave."" They did it to my poor brother and he is 21, no license, no job, forced in online colleges, and he can't have his social security. I am desperate.

1ibya53,Do DV shelters/organizations actually help?,Content_Cat8466,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ibya53/do_dv_sheltersorganizations_actually_help/,"My therapist wants me to reach out to a DV shelter in the town we will be moving to in 6 months to start getting info so I can make a better plan to leave. My issues with leaving are I have 2 toddlers, haven't worked in over 5 years and can't even work in my degree field anymore, have no income or savings for myself so have no money for an apartment on my own, etc. He said the DV Shelter/Organization might have connections and info on lawyers who work with DV victims on sliding scale and specialize in child custody issues with DV (he's never hurt the kids, but we all know it's just a matter of time), and that they might be able to help me find a job and an apartment.

I feel like they probably won't be able to help in most of these areas. He said what harm does it do to call and ask. I know it doesn't hurt to ask but I guess I'm scared to find out they can't help me or they'll tell me that what I'm experiencing isnt that bad compared to others (and it's not, but hearing someone say that well would just kill my little bit of resolve to leave the relationship). It doesn't help that it's a military town and my husband is a high ranking officer. So the second someone finds that out about me I feel like the perception is ""You are an officer's wife, you have money and resources most couldn't dream of, you don't need our help"". I've experienced that a little at my current post, my advocate constantly makes assumptions about me and my safety plan and my life because I am an officer's wife, and I have a college degree and dress nicely. 

I've also refused to involve the police and it seems most places expect you to do that if you really want help. I've read reviews of the DV shelter/organization and it's very mixed. It very much sounds like if they deem you worthy to help they do everything they can to help you and if not you're SOL. I also don't know if they'll even talk to me at all since I don't live there yet. Surely I can't be the first person who wants to leave a DV situation after a planned move and wants info before arriving there?? But it seems like everything talks about you have to go to the shelter that fits your location. ",2025-01-28 10:03:19,2025-03-17 03:10:52,help

The psychological abuse alone has forced me to move back home and leave my job. But the last few times I saw him he tried ‚Äúplay‚Äù slapping me during an argument and asked me to do it back to him. He also for the last few months kept saying he was a great man to me because he would never hit me. And he‚Äôs ‚Äúnever raised his voice to me‚Äù except one time he yelled at me to shut up because I talk to much when he asked me what I wanted to eat for dinner and I said ‚Äúummm‚Äù. 

Otherwise, he was possessive, jealous, cheating, and critical of me to an almost comical level. I‚Äôve had to do massive amounts of work to even begin to repair myself. He has been left by all his exes and has (kind of) admitted to being an asshole. He has two friends that I know of but ‚Äúbeef‚Äù with many people including his neighbors.

I stopped counseling in August when i felt my dv counselor was becoming a shell of a person and I was just talking the whole time without much feedback or support. Now I am left to deal with everything on my own and I often feel I am super close to reaching a breaking point. A person can only handle so much.

I was catfished by an ex 7 years ago when he pretended to be a female on Instagram in order to attempt to ship me back to him when he realized I found someone new and was moving on. I told ""her"" no thank you and that I am not interested in him anymore. He was also the one to break up with me so none of it makes sense to me logically, then again I don't think this guy functions based on logic - stalkers usually don't. the icing on the cake was that the pics he used to catfish me were of a girl he cheated on me with when we were together for all of 9 months (short relationship). I was na√Øve at that time and didn't think it was a catfish account until months later when ""she"" realized I wasn't going to go running back to my ex. at this point, she began telling me she is bi-sexual and found me attractive (a desperate attempt to feel connected to me or maybe sabotage my new relationship maybe? I will never know why he did that i guess)..she also told me she sells nudes to rich men on the internet and they send her money and she can help me get into this type of work if Im ever interested. At this point I knew this has to be a man being creepy and a catfish..but i was in too much denial to accept that my ex would do such a thing (even tho this catfish had his phone #) so i allowed myself to believe it was the actual girl (after all I texted my ex to tell him the girl was requesting to be instagram friends and he told me to add her if i want and warned me she is crazy)..I wanted to believe he has good morals and would not be the face behind the account..

he was... things escalated quite a bit. I attempted on several occassions over the last few years to make police reports and left the station in tears because I never received help. my partner called me crazy two years ago when i told him my ex sent me a photo of a knife. he said I was crazy and nobody wants to ""fucking"" hurt me. ofc i took that to police and they bluntly told me i could go to the magistrate office to get a warrant for his arrest but he will likely be released in a day and go to court later on so he would be free and will be more angry and likely try to hurt me..i also mentioned to my sisters and parents and they all treated it like some type of joke and never brought it up again..my sisters even said im overthinking and its some spam from insgtagram..but he created numerous new phone #s each time i blocked a # and followed me on tiktok making accounts pretending to be me, messaged my friends and family asking for photos of me. he even showed up outside of my home and that wasnt enough to get a police report..An irresponsible counselor suggested i try to meet my ex in a public setting to confront him. i met with him for food. he offered me food and i did not accept anything from him. i was too scared to confront him so i confronted him in texts after some time of gathering evidence and he freaked out. he has mentally abused me so much that Im now stuck in a situationship that is aggressive and sexual.

I (33F) was in a three-year relationship with a man (34M) who joined the Navy during our time together, turning our relationship bicoastal (CA--> FL). We broke up in April after I discovered he had been sending nude photos to women online and lying about his whereabouts, including going to strip clubs. Over his year-long Navy stint, he became deeply depressed, struggling with isolation from his friends, community, and me. Shortly after I ended things, he left the Navy on grounds that he was experiencing severe depression. 

Despite the breakup, it was hard knowing he was back home and so close. I missed him terribly, and eventually, I reached out. I wanted to talk in person, to make sense of everything. He had been deeply affected by his time in the Navy, and I tried to approach him with compassion, understanding that depression can drive people to act out in destructive ways. As we spent more time together, I began to forgive him for his lies and the betrayal. Over time, we grew closer, and, strangely, our relationship felt stronger than ever. He opened up more, communicated his feelings, and no longer lashed out when I expressed mine‚Äîa stark contrast to his behavior during his time in the Navy, when he‚Äôd hang up on me or dismiss my emotions entirely (once called my feelings stupid altogether). 

I know this paints an ugly picture of him, but I saw so much good in him. As someone who loves him and is loved by him, I know his heart and anyone can tell you that he is the most beautiful person. I just happen to know the dark, not so pretty sides of him too. He had a difficult upbringing, witnessing domestic abuse and being told to suppress his emotions. I wanted to believe his heart was kind, that he didn‚Äôt mean to hurt me. And truthfully, he did make real efforts to change. He's gotten really good at expressing his feelings lately. He is making a conscious effort and it has made me feel like he values this relationship. It's interesting because he's actually gotten better, and I've seen myself subside and become avoidant emotionally (because of all the yelling, I suppose). 

**Physical Violence:** 

Anyway, things came to a head on his birthday 1 month ago, which we spent together. He told me he wanted to spend the day with someone who mattered and that he was ready to make changes in his life. But our relationship had always been entwined with alcohol‚Äîhe‚Äôs a bartender and a heavy drinker, and I've always found myself mirroring those habits when we were together. That night, we got VERY drunk. My memory of the evening is patchy, but I remember arguing about money spent on weed. The next thing I knew, I had punched him in the face. Then I blacked out again.

When I came to again, he had my hair in his hands and slammed me to the floor. He stomped on my chest and choked me. I begged him to stop, but he didn‚Äôt. His face was blank, and I felt helpless. I got up and ran out of my apartment to call my cousin and recounted everything immediately in a haze of disbelief. My roommates, who had heard the commotion, made him leave the apartment, but I still felt compelled to let him sleep in my car since he lives two hours away and it was late (he had taken the train to come see me). Back inside my apt, I remember repeating ""he wouldn't do this to me... "" over and over but my roommates said that he did, that they heard it, and my cousin told me that she's glad I called her immediately because the memory was fresh and I honestly probably would have blocked it out. I was and still am in a complete state of denial. The only thing keeping me grounded in reality was the pain on my neck telling me it did happen. Even then, I couldn‚Äôt fully process what had happened. I kept telling myself, *This isn‚Äôt him. This is the alcohol.*

Later that night, when my roommates went back to sleep, I went out to check on him because he'd been blowing up my phone. He was angry and confused, yelling at me and started saying really mean things and calling me unlovable‚Äîwords that cut deeply because he‚Äôd never said anything like that before. He threatened to damage my car and demanded I drive him home. I told him I couldn't drive because I was drunk, but he pulled my hair again. With his hands in my hair this second time I knew it was undeniably real ‚ÄîI was much more sober by then and couldn‚Äôt believe it was happening, even after what he had already done. Eventually, I drove him to the train station around 2 am, once I felt sober enough. I didn‚Äôt feel safe with him nearby, and he wouldn‚Äôt let me back into my house without risking a scene in the middle of the night.

The next morning, he called to tell me he had made it home. He said he was done drinking and told me I needed to stay away from him. He admitted that no matter what I did, I (5'2"", 113 lbs) didn‚Äôt deserve to be thrown to the ground and choked by someone his size (6', \~200? lbs). He said his job was to protect me, but instead, he hurt me, and we couldn‚Äôt be together. I agreed.

In the weeks that have followed, he's sent occasional texts like ""I love you,"" ""I hope you're having a good day,"" and messages about missing me. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm struggling with flashbacks, panic attacks, and difficulty getting out of bed. I had to uncomfortably inform my workplace that I‚Äôd been ""assaulted"" without providing further details and continue pretending everything was normal.

I do not want to tell anyone. Especially not my family, even though it is extremely difficult to hide my pain from them. The only people who know are my therapist, cousin, roommates, and one close friend. I think part of me still holds on to some kind of hope that we'll turn out okay and be happy together, as irrational and delusional as that may seem.

I can't help but feel responsible for getting physical with him. I also hate living with the fact that I'll never truly know what started the fight- did he pull my hair first? Why the f\*ck would I punch him? I have to live with the fact that I did that to him too (although he claims vehemently that I did nothing wrong and if anything had years of pent up anger for how he's treated me... it's absolutely not acceptable. I fully acknowledge my role in this situation and I hate that it happened and that that I'll never know how it started).

**Flash Forward:** 

After 3 weeks of no contact, I‚Äôve seen him twice. It started with a hotel hookup‚Äîa moment of weakness where I sought closure and comfort. I was shaking and scared that he'd hurt me again (I've heard the stories about people who do it once and then find it easier to do again and again) but it felt necessary. I'd started to wonder about who this person I spent so much time loving really was and felt that seeing him again might help. Talking face-to-face about what happened helped in some ways, but it also reignited feelings I wasn‚Äôt ready to confront. The second time we met, I slipped into denial, pretending everything was fine and that we were back together. I‚Äôve since realized I was clinging to that delusion because it was easier than facing the immense pain of the pain he's caused me over the years, flashbacks of that night a month ago, and the ultimate loss of someone who I love very much. 

A few days ago, he reminded me that we cannot be together until we‚Äôve both taken time apart to heal. He said I'm enabling him and that he needs/deserves to feel the pain of losing me if he's ever going to change, otherwise me running back to him makes it feel like nothing happened. Hearing it from him shattered my fragile denial, and now I‚Äôm back at square one, feeling broken and overwhelmed. I know I need to heal, but the path forward feels daunting. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve turned to this community‚Äîfor advice, support, and a reminder that I‚Äôm not alone in trying to navigate this pain. Anything helps.",2024-11-30 21:36:48,2025-03-17 03:10:58,help

I apologize but I am going to give some context before I get to the issue.  I have been separated from my abuser for two years now. We have split custody of our daughter. I have spent this time in therapy working through all the brain washing I endured during my marriage and come to accept the abuse that occurred. My therapist specializes in cases like these. She also has worked closely with children in these cases. At one point I brought up concerns that my ex is SA our daughter. My therapist walked me through everything, from what questions to ask her and how to go about calling cops and cps. But they closed the case. I was painted as the crazy ex wife who is going nuclear and framing a good man. I sought out legal help and the lawyer said if I continue to press this matter I will lose my daughter. I have spent the past year sitting with the guilt of having my hands tied and not being able to help my daughter without the risk of losing her. I have been too afraid to talk to anyone about it in therapy because I know she will have to file a report and again risk losing my baby. I have been shown no one will believe me. My own family didn't believe me when I came to tell them about how he abused me. Okay now onto the issue at hand. Tonight before bed my daughter picked out one of the many books I bought that teach about SA awareness and safety in a kid appropriate way. This is the first time she picked this book out since a year ago when we went through the whole investigation. As I read her the book I am checking in with her, asking questions to make sure she understands what is going on in the story like I always do. This book in particular even gives prompt questions to ask. The answer she gave are very concerning to say the absolute least. I don't know what to do.

In the past we were together but he was violent just doing things like strangling me, not letting me get away at all as would lock me up, trying to make me drink bleach and various other things. I managed to leave the relationship which took a huge amount of strength but when I left I began using my DOC Heroin significantly more. I experienced some things during the course of our relationship which meant I became very dependant on him to the point I couldn‚Äôt go outside or use the toilet without him there. Anyway although I managed to leave us living together I still can‚Äôt break away from him 100%. I see him weekly and it‚Äôs messing me up so much as I‚Äôm now clean from drugs and alcohol but I‚Äôm worried his involvement will lead me to relapse.

If he stopped speaking to me I‚Äôd relapse. This is how fragile I am after being clean for nearly a year but it‚Äôs only towards him. I have no one around me at all.

so u can skip info because im so desperate for advice. The main question/point is last paragraph but I feel the context is imprtant

-His personality 

I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs the possessive, super insecure, overly in love to the point it‚Äôs toxic, with a really bad n terrible temper that affects everyone and thing in his life. 
so not necessarily a narc, who would directly neg, intentionally hide things or be horrible. but definitely self entitled. 
when something doesn‚Äôt go how he wants or expected, that‚Äôs when shit hits the fan.

-Emotional abuse 

In our relationship the abuse usually stems from his false perceptions or taking what I say personally. Which leads to minimisation, gaslighting, deflection, denying, going around in circles for hours until he is tired and admits fault. this is an exhausting cycle. 

-Physical abuse 

during arguments he had done things like put his hand over my mouth to shut me up, grab me by the neck, or like grab my thigh. Which wasn‚Äôt a lot compared to how much we argued but still. These were big things to me though, I spent countless conversations trying to aid our relationship and stop it, because it did hurt me a lot despite it not being extreme. 

-First proper physical incident (nov 2023) 

There was a major incident of abuse when I was pregnant (both intent to get abortion ), he grabbed me by the throat and kept restraining me on the bed not allowing me to leave, for a moment he had put a pillow over my face to smother me for 2 secs then punched my face over it not too hard but sorta, pulled my hair and told me to kill myself. threw my phone out the window. 

-Second incident (September 2024) 

Second incident was much worse and my memory isn‚Äôt great since we were drunk. 
we were so far from home on holiday, he locked me in a small toilet and wouldn‚Äôt let me leave after a good while. He took my phone and iPad away.  he choked me a couple times and restrained me on the bed. he sort of thrown me on the floor or something then he used his phone to film me for a couple seconds crying. I escaped through a window and got the hotel guy to get him to give me my stuff. At this point he was playing victim to the tens and was slitting his wrists in the shower saying he was gonna kill himself.

This happened the start of September yet it feels so long ago. I broke up with him after and I said we weren‚Äôt getting back but as time went on and he started an abusers programme, I evidently couldn‚Äôt cope without him.

-Am I an abuser? // third incident 

Since then, I‚Äôve been a totally different person, I was never even verbally abusive- that was out the picture for me , but now the slightest thing can trigger me and I‚Äôll start hurling insults, ones that he‚Äôd never even go as far as to call me. This doesn‚Äôt happen too often, but it‚Äôs been enough times. whenever he shuts down in an argument, or if I have a problem I wanna talk about n he ignores me, it‚Äôs like my whole body goes into over drive and I‚Äôll get physical. I genuinely feel like I am going so insane I need to be locked up. I‚Äôll tug on him hard to talk to me, basically wrestle him on the bed. Give him pussy slaps and hits to pester him to talk and just cry and beg. I want him to hit me, idk why, but the 2 incidents were the worst things to ever happen to me why would I want that? ITry to self harm infront of him, not even just for attention but just because it genuinely feels like it‚Äôs the end of the world to me . I know this is badly abusive, because I expressed this to my friends when he‚Äôd do it to me (he‚Äôd threaten it a lot, would try to take pills during arguments or go to stab himself). 

First time it happened it scared me and I swore I wouldnt again but I did. 
Same thing but i kept escalating it. I kept badly poking and prodding. We were fighting upright but in the terms of hes trying to get me off. he was lying about something that badly hurt me and was basically laughing about it- which triggered me so much so I poured soggy cereal on his head. In return I literally got wwe slammed onto the bed, restrained, choked, and my hair badly pulled, and then a proper slap across the face. might‚Äôve been more but my memory is horrible with these events. 
He left the room and blood boiled in me, if he can treat me like that why doesn‚Äôt he get the same in return? So I went out the room and swung, I meant to slap him but it was more a crab claw to the face. his nose started gushing. He spat the blood on me. 
This was probably a week ago, and objectively the worst that‚Äôs happened between us. I am obviously upset about it but I‚Äôm numb to it, I forget it happened considering how fresh it was. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm allowed to be upset about it because i kept pushing and pushing. I got what I wanted I guess.

Now im possessive, jealous, angry all the time and i know when it isn‚Äôt realistically right to feel this way yet i cant help have all of these negative emotions. Why do i want him to hit me when we argue? It‚Äôs not in a way of I‚Äôm trying to get him to do it so I have an excuse to leave, because I use to do that and i can differentiate the 2 feelings.
When I want him to do it it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm craving connection, or even just attention, idk it feels good during those moments. But why? 
I feel like I‚Äôve lost myself, I‚Äôm unrecognisable .",2025-01-13 19:33:49,2025-03-17 03:11:06,help

A part of me feels relieved, confused, and guilty. All I ever wanted from him was the truth and to treat me right.  Whenever I would call him out on his obvious lies, he would get upset and angry. 

At this point, I feel so alone but hopeful for the future. I think about the woman I was before I married him. I was the person I always wanted to be and the person who I thought would never be in this situation. Today I feel like I don‚Äôt know the person I‚Äôve become over the last 2 plus years. We go to church but I don‚Äôt feel as if God really honored our marriage. So many lies from the beginning that I did not discover until later. 


When he hit me and threatened my life three weeks ago, I was more concerned about him killing himself than what he did to me. Over the last few hours all I can think about is how my decision at this moment is so crucial. If I stay, it will only get worse because now he may be motivated to kill me.  

I‚Äôm confused by why the cops did not arrest him the night he hit me. I knew there was a warrant but why did they not arrest him before when they knew of his whereabouts? I just felt like that night I was so ready to be done and move on. I was so ready to start my new life until I came home to him the next day after I thought the locks were changed but not. I called the police then and they did nothing.  

Over the last three weeks, I thought about him hurting me in my sleep. Wanting to work it out but still that fear of the unknown. Spill trying to process everything. ",2024-05-04 02:31:53,2025-03-17 03:14:28,domestic violence

In light of this, how much do you disclose about past relationships where DV was a factor? And is there a way you specifically explain it? The level of abuse my ex did to me is so nuts that I honestly feel like I sound like I'm the one who is crazy just trying to explain it. The vibe was that the new guy asked why I got involved and assumed was that I must also be ""crazy"" if I ""allowed"" this to happen to me...and immediately friend-zoned me where we had been starting an intimate relationship.

Fast forward, I spent 15 years casually dating but basically remained single, healed through therapy and thought I was emotionally healthy etc.  I have now married a man who is beautiful inside and out.  Protective and wouldn't harm a hair on me or the kids.  We have experienced differences of opinions but it's always been respectful, calm, never shouting or physical. 

Last night we fell out, bound to happen we have a lot of kids and we disagreed on one of them.  Just talking and we were both getting frustrated with one another, so I got up and went to leave the room.  He asked where I was going and I said downstairs, that I didn't want to continue the conversation I was getting upset.  He jumped up to give me a cuddle and I freaked out. 

I asked him not to touch me and he went to cuddle me again and at that point he said what's wrong, I'm not going to hurt you, and he backed off.  He looked upset (retrospectivly I can see this face) and I moved into the corner of the room.  He came toward me and tried to hold me in a cuddle and I flipped, I held my arms up and started to panic, I started to cry and tbh didn't really see him, although it was him there, I pushed him away and really was in a state kept saying get away, don't touch me.   I then said get away from me again crying and panicked and he got to his knees to show me he didn't mean to be a threat, he stayed still until I calmed down and stopped breathing heavy and panicking.   

When I sat on the bed, he talked to me but was so hurt.  He said he could see my distress and just wanted to hold me safe and let me know I was safe.   I always tell him his arms are the safest place I've ever been.  He really is upset, saying he can't get the look on my face as I looked through him out of his head.  

We talked, I have no idea why this happened.  Never happened in 15 years and why with him, I know he wouldn't hurt me and I've explained I know this and trust him.  

Any ideas or advice please? How do I stop this happening again, how do I understand and how can I help him understand it wasn't his fault?",2023-07-05 11:44:15,2025-03-17 03:14:34,domestic violence

It‚Äôs been really beautiful finding a community of people who are all going through similar situations as I am. Here‚Äôs my story: 

I lived with my mom and my stepdad, and I have three siblings who still currently live there. My stepdad has always been emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive, and my mom has done nothing to help. He specifically targeted me because I‚Äôm transgender and very outspoken about when sh*t isn‚Äôt right. 

I had been dealing with the abuse since I was 12 years old, and I‚Äôll be 22 next month. I left the house around November, 2023 because my stepdad took it too far. He picked me up and threw me across the kitchen- basically almost k*lling me. He did this because I touched my little brother‚Äôs face to look at his loose tooth. It was so uncalled for. 

A few weeks later I packed up all my sh*t, put my stuff in storage- and I‚Äôve been living out of my coupe. I‚Äôve been trying to get government assistance but that hasn‚Äôt been working out at all. I have so many bills piling up from behind unable to keep up with payments. I‚Äôve been doing Uber Eats and I work part time at a museum- but all of my money has gone to keeping up with my car. 

Any advice would be amazing on any steps I can take to get out of this situation. I feel like I‚Äôve tried everything.

Apologies if any language is coarse, it was originally written for* r/UnethicalLifeProTips *specifically because she wants to work outside the system, and was written for that audience, but I've done my best to go back and edit to be more sensitive to current setting.*

**Note: I am not soliciting donations and will not accept direct financial aid if offered. I respect the generosity of individuals, but my friend's needs are systemic and are unlikely to be significantly helped by direct aid, however well intentioned.**

Redditors, I come to you today with a simple request: Help my friend escape her abusive home situation without reporting her abuser.

Context: I have a very dear friend, 38F, who for the sake of this post we'll call Jenny. Jenny has had an extremely difficult life. Her biological family was various shades of neglectful and abusing, and at age 10 when she did what she was supposed to do (reach out to the adults responsible for her and ask for help) due to SA at home, she was removed from the home and placed in the foster care system where the abuse only worsened. All of this to give context that

* Jenny is deeply untrusting of CPS and authorities in general
* Jenny has been conditioned to believe that the terrible things done to her are her fault, and that talking makes it worse
* Jenny has for much of her life attracted abusers who sense her vulnerability and prey on it.

Now, at 38, Jenny is a mother of 2 small children and is entirely dependent upon their abusive father. This man (we'll call him Dave) has abused her financially, emotionally, mentally, physically and sexually for the majority of their relationship. Jenny has finally reached her breaking point and has ended her relationship with this man, but as we all know, physically leaving an abusive asshole is another kettle of fish entirely. The abuse has ramped up since she stood up to him, and I have absolutely no doubts that if she's still in Dave's house in 3 months, she'll soon be in the ground, either because he put there or because he drove her to do it herself.

Jenny has no education and no financial resources. She has work experience and has worked entry level jobs (mostly fast food) but is currently unemployed. She has no safety net to speak of. She desperately wants to escape, but is utterly unwilling to report Dave, for the dual reason that she is reliant on his income to care for her children (he can't go to jail, he has to go to work) and that she has a massive, trauma fueled fear that CPS will take her babies away and they'll live through the same horrors that she experienced. *Note: I understand that most DV orgs will not report to police without the willing consent of the victim. This not a rational fear. That said, it's her VERY real fear, reinforced through trauma, and I'm attempting to be a safe person for someone who has known very few safe people in her life. I will not violate her boundaries, or pressure her to do so, when she's only learning how to enforce them, even if they're illogical.*

Our current plan is to have her, during her next WIC visit, speak to their access person and claim that her boyfriend no longer wants to be with her and is kicking her out in order to try and secure a fast track to emergency government housing, but I simply worry this won't be enough with her unwilling to discuss her abuse. After all, there's a ton of competition for these resources.

Redditors, I need help. I work in healthcare. All of my relevant knowledge revolves on leaning into the system to take advantage of the systems built to help victims. I have no idea how to even begin to navigate this without addressing the underlying abuse, but Jenny deserves basic human dignity, and I have to try. Please help me help this wonderful woman escape an abusive home. Any method of attaining short term housing, building resources that can't be taken away, and just starting to build a life for herself are welcome. All ideas will be considered. Jenny is located in central Indiana .Life has shit on this beautiful soul every moment of her life, please help me lift her up to attain basic human dignity. Also, if anyone who DOES work in the DV/CPS/LE systems has any insight into what she CAN talk about with ZERO fear of a criminal case being opened, or more importantly for her peace of mind, a CPS investigation, that would be huge insight as well. Thank you so much for your time and your help everyone.",2024-06-11 18:05:15,2025-03-17 03:14:47,domestic violence

He went with his mother and girlfriend but his whole family thinks he is the victim and im just trying to put him in jail he is a very good manipulator and narcissist. I highly doubt they know all the things he has done and said to me so i am  very surprised he brought them to his court date. So my question is would they have found out everything at the court date or is it more so just like here is your charges and this is your sentence.  I would have loved for everything to be thrown out there so they know the true person he is and the girlfriend would run!  I also hope the judge ripped into him and said how horrendous his behavior is. His charge ending up being contempt of court order and all the other harassment charges dropped in exchange of his plea.,2024-06-06 16:19:02,2025-03-17 03:14:48,domestic violence

There are two parents, a stay at home mom and a dad who works outside of the home. We can hear the mom screaming at the kids, slamming doors, and hitting walls. We do not know if she does it when the dad is at home. We do not think she hits the kids-- they have no signs of injury. There are periods where we don't hear anything, including ones where the mom is away. When that happens, we can often hear the dad playing with the kids, but no yelling. The yelling is often punctuated with stomping and cursing. It has been going on more than a year: it will stop for a few weeks or even a month or two, and then start up again.

We've asked friends what to do, and considered telling our landlord (who is a pretty decent guy and father), calling child protective services and calling the police. We've tried to keep a record of what we hear. Our friends have mixed opinions but most feel like getting child services or the cops involve would be worse for the kids. We've also considered contacting the dad and offering our help, either with babysitting or keeping an ear out or something. I really want to do what's best for the kids and I feel guilty every day we don't do anything.

I just joined this DV community a few days ago and have been reading post after post of violence and desperation‚Äîpeople wanting to leave but afraid to. It saddens me that the people we loved unconditionally and trusted would betray us. It‚Äôs just so heartbreaking, and I wish I could help everyone who‚Äôs going through it. I want to share my story, hoping it might give someone the courage to leave.

I met him in 2002‚Äîtall, dark, and handsome. We met at a weekly hotel, the only place I could afford at that time while working full-time at a restaurant. We moved in together quickly to save money. There were no red flags; he was hardworking, sweet, and caring. We worked together to save money and get out of the hotel, which was filled with drugs and frequent overdoses.

One day, he told me to get dressed because we were going somewhere, but he wouldn‚Äôt tell me where. He said he would take me to the moon. He surprised me by getting us an apartment, and we moved in right away. Everything was going well, and I was happy until, a few weeks later, he woke me up in the middle of the night, saying he had a dream that I was cheating on him. I was shocked, and he started hitting me and pulling my hair. I escaped that morning, but without a car, I could only walk down the street. He caught up to me, and a police car passed us. He begged me to calm down and said he was sorry, so I went back with him. I was in shock and didn‚Äôt know what to do, and I had nowhere else to go.

Months passed, and the emotional and mental abuse started. He would call me names, and I had to tiptoe around him, making sure not to trigger his anger. I always had to be cheerful, and it was exhausting. There was a time when he got so mad that he took me for a ride on the 101 freeway, punching me in the face while driving. I almost passed out, and he said he would dump me in an alley. I tried to escape many times. I would go to my mom‚Äôs house, but during that time, my mother was battling breast cancer, so I didn‚Äôt want to burden her with my problems. He would show up at my mom‚Äôs house and text me, threatening to cause problems if I didn‚Äôt come out. So I would just go with him.

The night he found my diary: I had written that I knew he was cheating on me and that I wished he would just leave me alone and go with her. When I came home from work that night, he was waiting for me. He tried to choke me, lifting me up with one hand. I felt my throat closing, and I passed out. When I woke up, he was laughing in my face, and his eyes looked different, almost possessed‚Äîlike he wasn‚Äôt the same man I fell in love with. When I got up, he kept screaming, slapping me, and punching my stomach until I started bleeding. He dropped me off at the hospital and left. I had a miscarriage.

The cops got involved, and at first, I got a restraining order and went to court. I thought I was free of him and that he would go to jail. But the lawyer told me he was only getting three months, and a social worker commented that animals have better protection than women. I left court that day thinking I had three months to get my things out of the house and find a new place. But the next day, he just walked right into the apartment. They let him out early without even warning me. He came into the house and told me he might as well kill me, saying I would never get rid of him. I felt so helpless and hopeless that I asked him to just end it. I was so tired. I gave up. I did what he told me to do and kept quiet, taking the abuse for 10 years. I was ashamed to ask for help because I didn‚Äôt want anyone to pity me.

Even during my mother‚Äôs funeral, he was furious at me for not making him breakfast because I had to handle funeral arrangements early in the morning. During the drive to the cemetery, he was screaming in my face about his missed breakfast. I was numb. I felt my mother telling me I could leave him now. I had been worried that if I left him while she was alive, he would cause problems for her, but now that she was gone, I didn‚Äôt have to worry about that anymore. I wanted to leave but had no savings and nowhere to go, so I stayed.

In 2012, he suddenly wanted to go to Alaska. I didn‚Äôt want to go, but I did‚ÄîI don‚Äôt even know why. I was just tired of fighting. I had a bad feeling, but I still went. The first two weeks in Alaska were the worst. I was now isolated from everything familiar and didn‚Äôt know anyone. One night, he woke me up in the middle of the night and asked if I loved him. That was the moment I truly realized I didn‚Äôt, but I told him yes. He then proceeded to punch me and drag me by my hair, threatening to kill me and then himself. It was so exhausting; I just wanted it to end.

Around 7 am that morning, he left to get beer, I think‚ÄîI don‚Äôt remember anymore. I called 911 and asked them to help me get out. While waiting for the cops, I tried to pack my belongings, but I couldn‚Äôt find my phone, and he had taken my debit card and cash. He left me with some coins and about $4‚ÄîI‚Äôll never forget that. When the cops arrived, I asked them to get my phone and card from him, but he claimed he didn‚Äôt have them. At that point, he was fuming, but I didn‚Äôt care‚ÄîI just left with the cops. They didn‚Äôt arrest him. The cops asked where they could drop me off, and I said the Anchorage airport, but they said it was 45 minutes away and instead dropped me off at a bus stop in front of a gas station about three blocks from the cabin.

As I sat at the bus stop, trying to figure out how to get to the airport and not even knowing which bus to take or when it was coming, a man with long white hair and a beard‚Äîlike Santa Claus‚Äîapproached me. He said he didn‚Äôt mean to pry but saw me get out of the police car and asked if I needed help. My mind was racing. I thought, if I go with this man, he could be a serial killer, but if I stay here, my ex might find me and kill me. I decided to go with him. I told him I needed help getting to the airport, and he said okay, but we‚Äôd have to pick up his wife at the post office on the way. I was relieved to hear that, so we got into his red truck. I may have laughed to myself a little when I saw the red truck thinking this guy is santa clause and I definitely felt safe with this man, even though I didn‚Äôt know his name. As we drove to pick up his wife, I told him what had happened. When we got to the post office, he parked far from the front door, probably to explain why I was in the truck. His wife saw me, started crying, and almost ran toward me. She opened the car door and gave me the warmest hug, and I started crying hysterically. They offered me a place to stay while I figured out my next steps, but I told them the ride was the best help they could give me. She didn‚Äôt have any money, but she gave me half a pack of cigarettes because I smoke, and a bottle of water before they dropped me off at the airport.

At the airport, I only had $4 and some coins. I called my cousin, who works for an airline, and he hooked me up with a buddy pass, which is a standby ticket, so I could only get on if there was an available seat. The only flight from Alaska to the mainland was at 1 AM, so I had to wait. I had to keep a low profile and spent time walking around the airport looking for a hidden spot. When 1 AM came, there was no seat for me, and I had to wait another day. It was my birthday. I was so hungry, so I used $2 to get a burger from the dollar menu. I ate half and saved the other half for later. I even used the other $2 to get coffee for my birthday. 1 AM came again, and still no seat for me. At this point, I started to have doubts. I was hungry, exhausted, and had no sleep for two nights. The airport floor was cold. I had to be strong. The next morning, the news reported a huge storm coming through Anchorage. The flight status board showed cancellations and delays, and the airport was chaotic. Around midnight, I watched through the windows as rain went sideways and strong winds shook the planes. I was freaking out because I already hate flying, and now there was a storm. I thought, no way am I flying in that. I figured the flight would be canceled anyway, as many others had been. But then they called my name! I hesitated, thinking, why?! I stood there for a minute, deciding what to do. Then I thought, screw it‚ÄîI‚Äôd rather die on that plane than be killed by my ex. I handed the lady my ticket and got on the plane. It was half-empty, which made me even more nervous, but I had three seats all to myself. I closed the window shade and mentally prepared myself, accepting that if this was my last day on earth, so be it. The plane took off through the storm, shaking violently for about five minutes, and then it calmed. I opened the shades and saw the gray storm clouds below the plane and stars in the dark blue sky above. I felt free‚ÄîI could breathe again. I started crying, and then my exhaustion took over, and I slept like a baby until we landed.

I made it to Virginia eventually. I didn‚Äôt have time to mope around; I went to work right away. I hated staying with family and depending on others, so I worked hard and saved every penny. Yes, many nights I felt lonely, and a part of me wanted the old him back, but I had to remind myself that he would kill me. I kept myself busy with work and eventually got my own place. I met new people who saw my potential and hard work, and now, I have my own space. It‚Äôs been 12 years now. Yes, I am still healing. I didn‚Äôt have time to go through a healing process because I was busy trying to survive. I don‚Äôt have much, but it‚Äôs mine. I wanted to share my story to give others hope. Yes, it is hard. It‚Äôs very lonely, physically, emotionally, and mentally. I have my cousin, but I don‚Äôt really share my problems with them. Even today, they don‚Äôt know the extent of what I went through. I don‚Äôt know why; maybe because I am ashamed that I let that man treat me like that‚Äîsomeone I used to love and trust. It‚Äôs hard to trust someone now, which is why I stay single. I also want to heal first before I can truly love another man.",2024-09-09 01:24:50,2025-03-17 03:15:04,survivor

And it was great at first - but then she suffered a back injury and fell into a deep depression. 
She said her back hurt too much to think of that- which makes sense. But she also has a history of SA, and most of her partners never really cared about what she wanted or asked for consent. 

Her back got better but the libido never returned. She is a lot more strict now on where I can touch her and asks me to initiate but when I do she rejects me every time. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because now she feels safe enough to say no, but I want to understand her better. I try and talk with her but sometimes it seems like she doesn‚Äôt even know what does and doesn‚Äôt trigger her. I‚Äôve tried suggesting mutually masturbating, or using toys, or even just making out so that there is some sort of intimacy. They work at first and then she withdraws again.

1gzq4ec,Advice on Resources for Male DV Survivors [SC],ArchimedesIncarnate,2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1gzq4ec/advice_on_resources_for_male_dv_survivors_sc/,"Hello,

Some quick background: My now ex was physically, financially, and emotionally abusive, and I took too long getting out because of family and religious pressures. Jehovah's Witnesses do not consider DV, especially against men, to be a valid reason for divorce. Hypocritically, they supported her when I got the kids to a therapist through the local DV support group and she was referred to CPS. I was attacked for ""giving the church a bad name"". Public writings try and paint a different picture, but the reality is DV survivors in the church, male or female, are always viewed as the problem for saying something.

Anyway, long story short, my career got derailed because of PTSD. Part of my key responsibility was leading emergency response to chemical spills, and I developed a tendency to freeze when it got intense. The actual situation I can handle, but the key moment was when a guy didn't like my orders shoved me into a corner. (He was trying to blow a toxic vapor cloud into a neighborhood. The correct response was to suppress it with sprinklers and continuously suck up the water with a waste vacuum truck.) I froze, and snapped out of it in time, but if I hadn't it could have been bad.

Two days later I had a panic attack so bad I ended up in inpatient mental health treatment for a month. That was fun. It turns out the trope that there's always a guy that thinks he's Jesus is based in reality.

I've been doing contract work and consulting for a few years now, interspersed with substitute teaching and restaurant work. I'm struggling to maintain mental health treatment, and I'm just so damn alone. The support groups I've found for men have been toxic, incel type attitudes. I have trouble letting down my guard with women. Or men for that matter. Having been raised in the JW cult, I had no support outside it. I've reconnected with my brother who left when I was 9, but that's it. Even my parents are ""Well, she's still going to the church"".

I want a real life again, and that means not just getting by. I've got to reengage with life and my career. Career will come first since that's the root of my confidence. I'm going back to school to get my MBA, and am back going to trivia nights when I can afford it, even if I play alone (Team name is Square Root of -1 Friends, written with the radical sign, because I'm a nerd.)

I want to quit half-assing work and sub-contracting, and go all in, and for that I need to fundraise for a business. I also need to figure out how to get mental health help. Everything I've found so far is for women.

I've heard there are grants available, but bureaucracy has always been my weakness, and for some reason it triggers anxiety. So do sales calls. Probably because of the fear of rejection. That couldn't possibly be caused by getting abandoned by everyone I've known for decades.

I'm good at what I do. I do safety for chemical plants. Risk assessments, mitigation, training. I'd saved up enough working two jobs to get started and Helene wiped me out, while also hurting the clients I had lined up, so they cancelled. I'm trying the Small Business Administration but it's a nightmare to navigate, and they're out of funding anyway.

Note: I am NOT fundraising here. Not only did I read rule #5, I wouldn't have done that here anyway. I'm trying to find out if there are programs and resources available, and how to get to them.

So....

Question 1: Is there help available to navigate getting health care? I freeze dealing with DSS, as they feel brusque and hostile. Intellectually I know they're probably just busy, but emotionally it feels personally hostile. Or it could be that the second caseworker for the DV told me I needed to ""man up"". So did my father. ""You can't freeze and panic every time someone says 'boo'"". I know it sounds pathetic, but I just need someone to hold my hand (figuratively, I'm uncomfortable with physical contact still).

Question 2: Is there startup assistance for male DV survivors? I've searched, and what I find sets off my spidey-sense. I could just be paranoid though. 

There's a lot I'm still processing, and may post on it, but I don't think I'll be able to fully til I have the practical stuff sorted.

Thank you,

1he9l5f,Survivor trying to survive,WildestDreams_33,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1he9l5f/survivor_trying_to_survive/,"Hello all.

Over the last year and a half, I‚Äôve been battling severe anxiety and depression due to the number of abuses I dealt with when my ex husband and I were together.

Recently I made a list of everything he‚Äôs done, and it‚Äôs LONG. From physical abuse, whether to me or in my environment to intimidate me. To verbal abuse, telling me I‚Äôm pathetic, garbage, nothing, and more. To emotional abuse, demeaning me and putting in implications, purposely saying and doing things to make me second guess myself, gaslighting, so much more. Financial abuse, taking all of my money and questioning every little purchase I made. He would manipulate me by making comments about my friends and family, saying they were bad people and manipulating me into not talking to them. Making me feel like my world should revolve around him and his needs and if I didn‚Äôt, I was afraid of what could happen.

He made me feel like I was crazy for reacting to his abuse. From age 20-32, I feel like I wasted so much of my life on this unstable man that love bombed me in the beginning and led me to being a divorced woman with nothing to show for myself besides the fact that i‚Äôm now mentally unstable because of this man and I try every day, have been since we divorced, to do and be better and it feels like it‚Äôs not enough to everyone else. Those being my ‚Äúclose‚Äù family members.

What they don‚Äôt understand is that was a HUGE chunk of my life, 12 years of love bombing, into fights once a month, to fights once a week, to fights daily. I know maybe some of the things I retorted with may have not been the best but the majority of what I did was indeed reactive, defensive, and most importantly, out of fear. I know it‚Äôs a two way street. But one street is busier than the other, quite frankly.

Now I‚Äôm living with my parents and it‚Äôs absolute torture. I can see why I gravitated to my ex husband, him and my mother are oddly similar. She tends to emotionally and verbally abuse the most, doesn‚Äôt care about people‚Äôs boundaries, but expects us to hold to her boundaries.

I‚Äôve wanted nothing but my mother‚Äôs love and comfort but I think I‚Äôm done with wanting that. The woman gives me severe anxiety and says rude things about me around me. The thought of having to talk to her gives me anxiety to the point where I‚Äôm shaking.

I need to get out of her house.
It‚Äôs too much.",2024-12-14 18:52:08,2025-03-17 03:15:12,survivor
1ex8bh4,Finding a job as a survivor in a small town. ,redactedanalyst,3,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1ex8bh4/finding_a_job_as_a_survivor_in_a_small_town/,"Hiya, friends. 

About two and a half years, I left a partner who was a very typical DV abuser: financial abuse, sexual assault, threats on my reputation, cyberstalking, and continued harassment after I left. When I did leave, I moved far enough away that I wasn't really worried about things, but about a year ago I had to move back to town. Before I moved, he had heard about my impending return through the grapevine and gave me this big obnoxious apology. Foolishly, I accepted it and he started rekindling a friendship with me... but he *started this by propositioning me for sexual favors and offering me resources and financial help in return.* 

This dynamic didn't last longer than a couple of months (I think my newfound confidence/unwillingness to capitulate really upset him) and he has left me well enough alone for the last year and a half. We've even bumped into each other at social gatherings to no conflict, just awkward laughter and avoidance. I have been living fairly happily thinking his need for control over me was done. That was until a couple weeks ago, where he demanded thousands of dollars from me and is threatening legal action if I don't repay it. Keep in mind that all of the money he gave me over the years was 1. offered as a gift 2. I was not given the opportunity to refuse it and 3. was given on the understanding that *this* was the incentive for me to continue to stay with him and tolerate the sexual abuse. 

  
I recently lost my job (due to PTSD symptoms and anxiety, mostly stemming from this situation), am staying with my current partner (who is absolutely darling and 100% safe), and have absolutely no money. I also do not have the mental fortitude to go into a small claims court and seek legal counsel to defend my right to not pay back money that was basically the anvil over my head justifying my rape. I've been working on trying to get a new job for the sake of being able to feed myself (I have recently forgone food more days than not as I sent him everything I had at the time with a note begging for him not to come and find me). I need to find work in town, but I don't know how to get over the anxiety of having *any* job that isn't WFH due to the risk of bumping into him or someone he knows. He always makes little power grabs shortly after I bump into him around town, and I have recently stopped leaving the house (and even attempted to move states, though that was a total bust) to minimize the chances of this escalating into either a legal issue or worsened abuse (yes, I am aware that the situation as it stands now is in and of itself abuse). It's also worth mentioning that my ex is a very well-known and well-respected person in town and I am a relative nobody (save for those who know me through him, to which I have likely been caricatured as a complete monster). 

So uhhh **TL;DR: How should I go about finding and furthering a career when I share a small town with an abuser who recently started making new power grabs?**",2024-08-20 21:59:14,2025-03-17 03:15:13,survivor

My name is Corey, and I am a survivor of domestic violence. After escaping an abusive situation, I now find myself homeless, battling severe mental health challenges, and struggling with heart failure. The combined weight of these hardships has made it nearly impossible for me to support myself financially, and I am in desperate need of help.

Leaving behind an abusive environment was one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever done, but I had hoped it would bring me peace and stability. Instead, I am facing new challenges. My mental health has suffered greatly, making it difficult to function in daily life. On top of this, heart failure has weakened my body, and I‚Äôve been unable to maintain steady work or afford even the most basic necessities like food or shelter.

I am reaching out to ask for help because I simply can‚Äôt do this alone. Accessing  the care I need to start healing‚Äîboth physically and mentally. I have taken a step forward in the healing process which  will allow me to take these critical first steps toward recovery.

Any advice you can give would make a tremendous difference in my life right now. Your support would help me regain some stability and hope for the future‚Äîsomething I desperately need after enduring so much.

While he hasn't purposely physically hurt me yet, there are other signs that shows me that he might get physical eventually. He doesn't respect my physically boundaries and is now stonewalling me whenever I say ""Stop"" and doesn't apologize. He fake punches/kicks me and puts me in chokeholds. He has playfully tortured me with box cutters/sharp knives by holding me down and pretending he's going to stab me. His parents have asked us to watch over their dog multiple times, and whenever the dog is around, he would constantly ""playfully"" threaten her or even expose himself to her. He would lightly slap my face, and when I ask him about it, he says ""I didn't slap you, I tapped you, there's a difference."" At least 5 days out of the week, he would randomly threaten me - like last week for example, he walked into our office and randomly said ""I could end your life right now"". He seems to be super paranoid... would check my phone when I'm not around/ask me about conversations I'm having over the phone (like with my MOM)/if he hears something drop in another room, he would get the sharp kitchen knife before going into the room. I can go on and on and on, but needless to say - I know I need to leave this relationship, but I have a lot of fears.  

I've already called the DV hotline, and they gave me a ton of great tips. But I was wondering if I can also hear stories from those who have successfully escaped a domestic violence situation, and how did that go (from planning to leave, to the actual break up, and then how things went afterwards).

",Embarrassed_Power342,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1g3nbzc/survivors_how_do_you_navigate_tough_convos/,"I (f21) had a tough conversation with my partner (m21) last night regarding trauma related to my former relationship that ended with domestic violence. 

TLDR: How do you know where the line is when sharing about your trauma with your partner? 

From ages 17-19 I was in an abusive relationship. Towards the end it began to get very bad and lives were threatened and it led me to getting a restraining order and staying at home for a month, quitting school and my jobs, I was afraid to leave my house. I continued therapy and still go as it is very helpful and I have made so much growth the past few years. Yet randomly an object of his I could‚Äôve sworn I threw away appeared in my house the other day and it made me feel so triggered. It made me fearful to run my errands and left me feeling trapped in that headspace I was in a few years ago. I don‚Äôt often get so triggered anymore so this caught me off guard. I have been a little on edge since he texted me a few months ago that he still hated me. My partner noticed I was off and asked what was going on. I avoided the conversation worried it would make him uncomfortable. We‚Äôve been together for a year now but I often try to avoid talking about my past relationship as I think it‚Äôs uncomfortable for the both of us. He told me he really wanted to know what was going on, because he wants to understand the ins and outs of my anxiety so he can support me better. I explained how seeing this meaningful object I thought was long gone really triggered me and made me feel so paranoid. He was a great listener and very supportive of everything I shared and telling him about the goals I have to help myself. 

Despite this, some things they said rubbed me the wrong way. I know he has my best interest in mind, and he was not disrespectful at all but I just felt like he doesn‚Äôt understand why being reminded of him makes me so paranoid. He was telling me how my paranoia is extremely abnormal and I shouldn‚Äôt live life that way, that I don‚Äôt have to let things bother me when they come up, and that my goals should revolve on how to be more nonchalant when something comes up again so I won‚Äôt be so triggered. I don‚Äôt know how I will get to that point other than reminding myself I am safe now, and just trying to forget what happened as time passes. I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt know the extend of how things were. I‚Äôve never felt it was appropriate to share anything more than simple details, or focused any conversation about it on the financial abuse and cheating. I‚Äôve never disclosed the more physical and psychological abuse I endured in that relationship outside of therapy and court. When I am reminded of him, I can‚Äôt help but remember how when I finally left and got the restraining order the threats to both my life and his he made and the other damaging things he said. They truly stick with me and I wish those memories could just go away. I am left just feeling so frustrated and guilty for sharing my feelings and somehow alone even when I have someone wanting to be there for me. I‚Äôm trying to just remind myself that I am loved and supported and that he wanted to hear what I was so paranoid about. ",2024-10-14 18:44:08,2025-03-17 03:16:17,survivor

Feeling like a victim after an abusive relationship and constantly thinking why he hurt me. It's like an overwhelming and disgusting feeling of being used, abused and broken down by the person that was supposed to love me. I am very much still trauma bonded and I still miss him. But I have these feelings daily and I feel completely and utterly lost. I know this is not the best mindset to have, because at some point feeling like a victim can actually have a bad effect and you can get stuck feeling like that. I suppose time will make things better.

At what point did you start feeling better? Did it take you months or even years or are you still healing? I am just waiting for the moment of feeling strong but at the moment I am struggling. Is it even possible to heal from domestic violence without any therapy in the future? My self-esteem was already low when I met him but now it's even worse and it feels like he is the one who can fix it. Am aware that it's because of the trauma bond but this is how it genuinely feels like. ",2024-08-08 20:09:32,2025-03-17 03:16:18,survivor

For over a year I have been dating this girl who is a survivors of three years worth of physical and emotional abuse. She has two kids with two separate men aged 2 and 5. The 2 year old is the son of her abuser who has not had contact with him in over a year. She ended the relationship with her abuser January 2023 and still lived with him because of their kid. Throughout the relationship he stalked her and controlled who she spoke to and treated her like an object. April of 2023 he assaulted her in the home and a NCO was put in place. In June of 2023 we went on our first date and that night when she got home, he broke into her home and assaulted her again. Since then all trials dates have been delayed and custody hearing have been delayed which has put stress on her. Everytime a trial date was near she would become emotionally distant but would recover once it‚Äôs passed. In March if this year the alleged final trial date was set and so again she became distant but this trial was move again to June which he plead guilty in open court to 8 felonies and sentencing was put back till August. Since the March date she has been distant with me and says it‚Äôs due to the stress of not knowing what will happen with the sentencing and custody stuff.

Enough context, she is now saying that we need to break up so she can heal. She said she has been healing from the abuse but thinks that her feeling this way for the past few months is due to the abuse and we need to seperate for her to heal. She really does not want to break up but steels like this is a necessary step. I pointed out to her that I don‚Äôt think us breaking up will fix anything and that she needs therapy as her issues are internal
And not with me and only appeared when court came into play. I told her to at least try therapy before we break up which she agreed to. I know that she is stressed and hurting and needs to heal and I know she is acting like this because of all the upcoming court dates. How can I help her heal? I assured her I will always be there for her no matter how long it takes. Even called of our wedding so she can have as much time as she needs to heal.

We spend all of our time together and I mean that, even when she is feeling this way she wants to be around me. I just want to help her. Also have other posts about her story on my account if you want further context.",2024-07-30 18:47:05,2025-03-17 03:16:21,survivor

Please see my last two posts for context.

My abuser was in court this morning for sentencing based on his last attack on his most recent victim.

(We are UK btw)
His sentencing has been postponed and referred to a different court. This basically means that Magistrates Court didn't feel they could sufficiently punish him with their harshest sentence, so on 29th October he will be appearing in Crown Court for his actual sentence. The punishment here will be higher and harsher. He has been identified as the worst type of DV Perpetrator.

This just keeps getting better and better. I am still coaching and supporting the the recent girlfriend through the process I went through 3 years ago and we are healing together. Still a strange way to make a new friend but I'm ok with it.

I moved back to keep custody of my twins, but without good employment since 2018 I am struggling financially.

Has anyone encountered economic abuse from an estranged spouse or stalker? I had a bad date with a guy in 1999 who decided he ""owns me"" but we didn't have an actual relationship. We never even talked again after single date. He broke up marriage in 2000. He may have misrepresented himself as father of my twins and I am worried what that did emotionally and psychologically to 23 year old sons! I worried about ""secrets"" my sons kept away from me.

1euy1g1,8/17/22 I am a survivor of 2 years as of today.,druzyquartzz,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1euy1g1/81722_i_am_a_survivor_of_2_years_as_of_today/,"My name is anon, I am  24 years old. I consider myself one of the lucky ones, meaning I got out alive. So many of us don't make it out alive. I was given a second chance at life. I have made it my purpose to help others like me, like us. I'm doing it for the ones who didn't make it, the ones who dreamed of the better days to come. The ones who felt lost, unheard and alone. I whole heartedly believe our stories need to be shared for them, for their loved ones, we can make an impact bigger than we will ever know. 

Today makes 2 years since my ex almost succeeded in murdering me. My story is very graphic. Telling my story has been a long and draining process. Along my journey I have been writing a book to share my story and others alike. I come here today to talk about this, I have been an inspiration to so many people and I would like to share the stories of those who are to afraid or ashamed to do so on their own, I will do this anonymously. If this is allowed in this group, I would love for those interested to reach out to me. I would be honored to share your story, our stories deserve to be heard. My goal for this book is to save people like us. To make others feel seen, to assure that they are not alone and no matter how hard it is, there is hope. This book, our stories, could be someone's saving grace. It could be a guide for families whos loved ones that are victims of DV. 

You are not alone in this, let me be your voice. I will be publishing this book anonymously. I plan to donate a large sum of the proceedings to DV shelters nation wide, maybe one day even world wide. This book will be NSFW, many of our stories are graphic, trigger warnings will be listed on the first page. I do not want to leave one detail out of my story, it deserves to be heard as it is. Nothing about any of our stories deserves to be censored. We deserve to be heard, the good the bad and the ugly. 

My ex was and still is a narcissist. I have been no contact for one year, we have a daughter together. I was with him for almost 7 years. I was 15 and he was 18, I was groomed. I wont go into depth about my story, but I will share some. He lured me in with love bombing, I thought he was my soulmate. when it was good, it was amazing. It never lasted. one year in is when he began to be physically abusive. Unfortunately I thought it was normal. I grew up being abused by my father, I watched him abuse my mother. Everyone around me was abusive or being abused. My mom was only ever in abusive relationships, I didn't know anything else. I convinced myself every relationship contained abuse. I was wrong, I was so wrong. 

8/17/22 was not the first time he tried to kill me. But, it was the first time I ever experienced death. in the process he hurt my daughter who was 16 m old. He had called 911 and told them he killed me. The police never showed up, in the city I lived in they don't take DV calls seriously. An officer once told me months later that the woman always goes back. All I could think about was how many of us have to die before we are taken seriously? What about the ones who didn't go back? What about the ones they could have saved by just showing up and not leaving their calls unanswered. I didn't make a police report, when the police failed me that day I felt like it didn't matter, like I didn't matter. This book can change that, our stories can change that.  We aren't survivors for no reason. We deserve justice, we deserve to be taken seriously. Authorities ESPECIALLY, should take us seriously. #nomorecallsleftunanswered . 

Even if you haven't escaped yet, your story still deserves to be heard. Hold onto hope, hold onto your dreams for better to come. Hold on to survival. You will be free one day, even when you feel that it is impossible, it is. I say this because I am currently sitting on my couch, in my home, while the love of my life lounges next to me. I met him in November 2022. I never knew love could be so kind, so soft, so genuine. He too is a victim of DV, abuse comes in so many forms. Men suffer abuse too, I'm tired of the stereotypes. Men deserve to be heard without feeling ashamed because they are a man. He was emotionally and verbally abused by his ex, the mother of his child. Together we have learned what love is. I am so thankful to be alive today. I am so thankful I didn't let what I have been through steer me away from the fact that I would truly find love one day. What I once had was not love, no matter how hard I tried to convince myself it was. 

In the last 2 years not only did I find true love, I found home. I am in therapy to process my traumas. I get to be a stepmother to a beautiful little girl. My daughter is Thriving, she gets to have a sister and a best friend the same age to grow up with. I get to watch them both be the best big sisters to the beautiful baby girl i welcomed into this world with the love of my life right by my side. I got to experience a happy and save pregnancy. I got to experience birth with someone who treats me like a goddess that walks this earth, I got to return from the hospital to a safe and happy home. He took care of me and loved me every step of the way. I promise, some way, some how it gets better. You deserve love. You deserve the love you give in return. You ARE worthy of love, happiness, and so much more. 

Leaving is so hard, I don't think it will ever be easy. But our survival, our stories alone could be someone's reason before its too late. I could have been another story you hear on the news, I could have been one of those who didn't get to see better days. I am alive for a reason, I believe everything happens for a reason. I think that saying got me through the darkest times. I told myself every day that it will get better, I will know happiness, I will know love, I will know what it is to truly live. 

I was given a second chance for this very reason. 

Help me bring this reason to life. Let me help you bring your story to so many other people like us. Man, Woman, Non Binary, Trans, all are welcome, all deserve to be shared. I will be your voice. Together we will anonymously change the way people view domestic violence. Together we will help bring understanding. Together we will make a change.

She recently pushed me away after we had an argument. It felt like a pretty mild argument, but at the end of it she walked out and texted me later with some related accusations I'd never heard anything about from her before, and from my perspective, had very little basis in fact. She was talking about how I would never change. To me it read as imminent breakup talk. Now, after a lot of pleading, we seem stable again.

It‚Äôs me again with some more helpful info that many dv survivors/ victims may not know or be aware of (this time concerning strangulation/hands to the throat):

*Most people use being ‚Äúchoked‚Äù and ‚Äústrangled‚Äù interchangeably but there is in fact a difference: 
Choking: an accidental internal obstruction of the airway
Strangulation: a tactic of control and abuse

*The chances of a male strangling their partner is significantly higher than the chances of a female strangling their partner (Women are more prone to strangling a child or someone smaller in size than them) 

*If your partner strangles you they are considered a ‚ÄúStrangler‚Äù and ‚ÄúStranglers‚Äù lead to becoming killers in almost every situation (Could take more than one instance). It is scientifically proven that if they strangle you and you stay they WILL eventually kill you or make a very strong attempt

*If you feel pain in your neck, behind your ears, or in your throat, there is blood vessels burst in your eye(s), small red or purple dots on your face, scalp, eyes, ears, or nose (this is called petechiae), loss of voice or any noticeable change after being strangled PLEASE GO TO A DR! 

* 4.4lbs of pressure placed on the jugular for 10 seconds is necessary to cause unconsciousness. 33lbs of pressure on the trachea is required to completely close it off. If pressure is released immediately consciousness will be regained within 10 seconds. If consciousness is not regained and the person continues the strangulation, urination or using the bathroom on oneself can occur and eventually death can occur after 4-5 min 

Again please feel free to reach out if there are any questions or concerns

As always stay safe‚ù§Ô∏è

1eig6ob,DV survivor need help finding evidence trail,ela_mental,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1eig6ob/dv_survivor_need_help_finding_evidence_trail/,"Hello, 

First time posting but I really need help and Reddit is usually pretty awesome with that. 

I have a difficult situation I hope  you can help out with. I went through DV (domestic violence) that was really intense. I am trying to press charges however the evidence is a little muddied. 

I took a photo of the bruises on my neck. But I hid them in fear that he would find them on my phone. So I hid them in a really old note of mine. I then went a year or 2 later and uploaded them to google drive. So there is no time stamp on the photo of the actual date and time it was taken. And when I go to the history of the photo on the google drive it only shows me the date it was created. 

  
Is there any way to find the old info for the photo. It was taken on a iphone. I do still have the iphone if that helps. 

  
Any help would be awesome. Cross posted. ",2024-08-02 17:37:28,2025-03-17 03:16:37,survivor
1f16le5,A community for partners and friends of survivors,GrayFrogDuty,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1f16le5/a_community_for_partners_and_friends_of_survivors/,"I want to find or help create a forum for friends and partners of abuse survivors.

Can anybody help me find one?

This seems like a really needed resource. I've had to learn from scratch how to be the correct support for my survivor girlfriend. It's been the most difficult thing I've ever had to do, and my only real resource for facts and guidance has been my own mental health counselor. And I'm still figuring things out.

For bonus info, here's my best wisdom so far. This is ""stuff I wish I'd known from day 1.""

**Commenters, PLEASE feel free to suggest more points or edits!**

**1. Just be there**

Don't push. Don't pull. Just respond with positive attention and supporting affirmation when and only when they reach out for it.

**2. General guideline: learn the patterns of abusers, and avoid falling into that pattern when you can**

This is a tough one. It's impossible to be the photo-negative of an abuser, because during the ""calm periods"" they acted like a good partner should act. Don't hold your life and well-being hostage to your partner's trauma, they need to work with you.

**3. There is such thing as too much love**

If you're trying to push them to believe that you're a good one, that counts as pushing. Their abuser love-bombed them and now your partner has an association between lots of love and abuse. Instead, just be what they need, see #1.

Instead of more love, focus on fostering **respect** for them as a person, and their autonomy.

**4. Words are meaningless**

True support is in the doing and being, not talk. Your partner has been suckered by talk before. The more you talk, the more they hear bullshit and are waiting for it to get bad.

**5. They need control**

Their need for control of their life and their world goes **deeper than logic and rationality**. When you get into an argument, you will **not** get out by just being calm and reasonable. They need to be right because being wrong is vulnerability and vulnerability comes right before hurt.

**WARNING:** This might be how the propagation of abused-to-abuser starts! If your partner insists on controlling their world to the point where they're controlling you, THAT IS UNHEALTHY FOR YOU. That means they're not ready for this relationship yet.

When arguments happen, I'm still not sure what to do. My best advice so far is, listen, validate what they feel, let them know in general terms that your perspective is different. Don't win the argument, but I guess pause it to give them time to figure it out on their own. Compromise where it's reasonable for you.

**6. Recognize how small a taking of control can be**

They'll feel loss of control in the tiniest things. Offering help with daily tasks. Making suggestions for their home or life (including therapy/counseling/healing process). Offering to drive, or pay for something. This is how their abuser took control.

On the other hand, a healthy relationship requires these concessions. You can be sensitive, but for the relationship to continue, they'll need to learn that trust.

**7. Be ready to be pushed away**

You will be pushed away. Usually after a disagreement or argument that seems like nothing. **You need your life to be in a place where you're OK without them while they have the space they need.** Otherwise, you're not ready to be in a relationship with them.

Do NOT pull them back in. See #1.

**8. Bolster your own emotional support network**

You need your life to be OK without them, before you can help them. You need people to talk to about what you're going through. You need someone who can tell you if the relationship you're in is becoming the propagation of abused-to-abuser. Have family, have a counselor, have friends.

**9. If they're not trying to heal themselves, then you can't support them yet**

They should at least be at the point where they recognize that their trauma exists, and taking some sort of steps to heal. Journaling, counseling, self-help books, group support, something. If they're pretending there's no problem, then they're not ready for a romantic relationship.

**Final acknowledgement**

You need to be in a healthy relationship. A lot of the advice above is a slippery slope for keeping yourself in an unhealthy situation. There is a balance between being sensitive to your partner's needs, and being held hostage by their trauma. You can support them, but they need to be working with you. Don't get caught in the trap of ""I can fix them,"" because that's not your role. They need to be in charge of healing themselves, and you are only one support and resource among many others.",2024-08-25 20:52:26,2025-03-17 03:16:38,survivor

I am 3+ years free from my abuser of 5 years. I'm trying to find a local or online support group I can attend for non active DV recovery. 

I still have panic attacks, and am triggered by certain scenarios with my new partner. I have to remind myself I am safe constantly when something comes up, I have to do my grounding exercises, and practice my patience with myself. I am angry, and scared, and sad that I'm stuck like this. It's not all the time, but it's more than a ""normal"" person. I have to work really hard to feel okay, even 3 years later.

I told my therapist (who I stopped seeing because I lost insurance) that I'm not in it anymore, so I haven't gone to a group. I don't feel like I am at risk right now, and I don't want to use resources meant for people who are actively in danger. She helped me reframe it by asking how long I would get help for myself if I was sick or physically injured, and the answer is until I'm better. Ergo I should get help with my trauma until I'm better. 

I don't know where to go though, I'm not sure what resources are available to me. I can't afford therapy for my recovery. Everytime I search online I just find DV shelters, emergency support, or trauma therapy. I'm hoping to find an AA style group for DV survivors, but I'm not sure where to go for it. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. I am located in the US, DM me for more specific location information.

Much thanks in advanced üíû to anyone who is in active abuse just know it does get better, even if it sticks with you.",2024-02-10 00:18:02,2025-03-17 03:16:50,survivor

If it‚Äôs not I apologize in advance. I 28(f) just got divorced a year ago now and just started to step back into the dating world. A short back story on the 10 years I was married, my ex husband was extremely abusive physically / emotionally. He also was a pathological liar / cheater. We have 1 daughter together and I finally had the strength to leave a year and a half ago because I wanted to save my daughter from that environment, while also saving myself because the abuse continued to get worse. I am forever grateful to have made it out alive because I know that‚Äôs not the reality for a lot of DV survivors. 

Fast forward a year & 1/2 to me being single, figuring out my life as a new single mom. I have slowly considered the idea of dating again.I Met a guy (27m) and he is all the things I could ask for in a guy. Kind, caring, considerate, understanding about me being a single mom ( he has not met my daughter because I have a strict 8-12 month rule for anyone to meet her) and goes above & beyond for me for the past 3 months we‚Äôve been seeing each other but now I‚Äôm starting to notice similarities between him and my ex. He‚Äôs expressed how he doesn‚Äôt like my mom ( which my ex used to do aka leading to isolation) how I need to move away from my parents. Then a today he confessed to me that he was physically abusive in his last ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship about 8 years ago but has gotten counseling since and has never done it again. A big obvious red flag but the empath in me understands how people can make mistakes and not repeat them. The advice I‚Äôm seeking is has anyone had a partner tell you about them doing something like this in their past but has never seen them do that going forward. Overall my instinct tells me this is my sign to move on from him. I know the obvious answer is to cut it off but after being in a abusive relationship for so long, it can distort your reality / perspective on things. Please be kind.

I‚Äôm (27F) a survivor of DV. Most of it was emotional, mental, and sexual abuse. I left my abuser about 5-6 years ago and I am married to the man of my dreams(25M). 

I have a problem with saying how I feel when I feel it and I end up keeping everything in until the most inconvenient moment, since I wasn‚Äôt really allowed to voice my opinion in my last relationship. My husband has a problem with that and he doesn‚Äôt understand and last night he said I was retreating to my ‚Äúold ways‚Äù I tried to tell him I‚Äôm still healing and it‚Äôs so fucking hard for me.

We don‚Äôt fight, but we do disagree but we never let it get to a blow up because I can‚Äôt handle that. 

FF to today and he sent me a tiktok about how kids are struggling to pay for things and aren‚Äôt paid a livable wage and I told him I hope it gets better for when our future kids grow up they don‚Äôt have to deal with these struggles. I guess I was wrong to say that because he told me that was not was he was referring too and that he doesn‚Äôt care about other kids we don‚Äôt have right now.

Now im internally freaking out because his one thing he says is that I don‚Äôt listen to him but I do, I just have really bad memory issues and I forget a lot of things sometimes. 

How long until I can feel normal again? Why does healing take so fucking long, im over all of this shit at this point. I have to try my hardest just to not get offended because of something my husband says when he‚Äôs joking around.

We argue sometimes. Or to be more accurate I get defensice and argue until he shows any sign of frustration or arguing back and then I act like hes being abusive.

I lived 2500miles from my family and just left my husband of 11years. I spent 4 years in and out of this cycle of abuse. I was beaten every 3 days, strangled, ran over with my own vehicle...I sent my kids away before becoming homeless. For YEARS I would break free and get sucked right back in. Trauma is the reason. I felt like I deserved it. I had been stuck in fight or flight since I was 2. 

In 2016 I found myself homeless, in Las Vegas, with my abuser jailed and beaten by the police. He was released with a broken jaw.  Retribution I believe.  He was on meth and locked himself in a closet.  When he came out he was handing me his teeth as he pulled them from his jaw freaking out. That was the last time I spoke with him.  

I traveled from Phoenix, to Vegas,  to California, to Memphis all by myself. My balls dropped in Vegas the 4th time I was almost kidnapped. I've been fearless every since. 

In 2017 I stole a vehicle and got locked up in Texas. Then transferred to Mississippi after 12 months to answer for the vehicle I stole. In the mean time,  a man that I met along the way was signing for 25 years in Louisiana for an armed robbery I initiated. I beat the bullet and get very lucky. 

I have spent the last 6 years processing through ALL of my trauma.  EMDR saved my brain and my life. I've worked in the Recovery field for 2 years. I spend 45+ hrs a week talking about what I've put myself through and how I was able to get out of it.

It took me 7 and 8 years to get my kids back. They spent the time with their father being neglected and abused. They are a product of my decisions and I work tirelessly every day to make sure they have what they need. Services for mental health, love and encouragement and the idea that you can change. You can process through your shit and have everything you deserve. I've remarried to a man that is also in recovery. Together we are a powerhouse and will not stop until these kids heal. 

You can go through hell, put yourself through the worst and put yourself back together.  You can thrive and have happiness and love.",2023-08-25 18:01:21,2025-03-17 03:17:03,survivor

We lived together for 5 years. It was very difficult mentally to leave but when I did I got up and made a plan to leave physically. It is very dangerous for domestic violent victims to leave their abuser. It is much safer for the abuser to abandon their supply. None the less I‚Äôve been free from my abusive ex with the help of a no contact order for almost two years now. When I look around I do not see any healthy relationships around me. A good 3 of them I would say are as bad as mine was and these people will trauma dump on me and say that they need to leave and then a week later will worship the men that love bomb them. I see the cycle and I thought living the cycle was hard but I find my opened eyes watching others continue their own cycle is wayyyy harder. I‚Äôve reached the point of removing some of the people from my Snapchat or other social media. I give them perspective and opinions but they stay anyways and I guess in a way I feel unheard and hurt to watch the cycle start again. I just want true happiness for everyone and for them true happiness doesn‚Äôt seem be their priority. Only ‚Äúfixing‚Äù their broken relationships that has had boundaries crossed and moments that they will never be able to forgive but they are able to forget for large moments. Bringing up the horrific moments only when it uplifts the new argument to have an upper hand maybe.. Idk if it‚Äôs just me or if maybe misery likes company and I‚Äôm no longer in that moment so maybe it is them and I just need different friends.,2023-09-08 12:40:09,2025-03-17 03:17:07,survivor

On the way to the airport he pulled over right by the airport driveway. He gave me a few items he had taken when I had left him. Then he put a gun into my back. He told me to look off at the sunset and it would all be over with, I told him to fuck off. I didn't hear the gun go off just felt the heat of the bullet going in my back.  I grabbed the gun and the steering wheel pulling the car off the road into a field. He managed to shot me two more times in the chest before the gun jammed and I was able to open the door. As the Corvette swearved back onto the road I leaned out allowing myself to be thrown from the car. It was the last time I saw him alive. It was also the last time I would walk.

But nothing on my question.

Has any survivor here had an abuser tell them that the abuse was caused by YOUR depression, anxiety, PTSD, mania, OCD, bipolar, etc. etc.? Or any expressions of those things (i.e. you just had to keep mentioning the thing you are anxious about too many times that day, or you were so hyperfocused on manic problem-solving that you were not ""in the relationship"" to their satisfaction)?

Also, has any survivor here had an abuser tell them the abuse was caused by you being autistic and having meltdowns or shutdowns?

My person has at varying times named these types of things as ""my abusive behaviours."" I wondered how common this is. Presumably, I'm a survivor, but no one has managed to convince me of it yet. I am always worried I am the aggressor. I wondered if the complaints he has made are common ones from other aggressors. Naturally, I also wonder if he is right.

Incidentally, he also blames me for ""triggering his PTSD."" I do see the contradiction here in his reasoning. Me being anxious for weeks (an expression of emotional trauma) is ""abusive."" But him responding through black rage ""because"" I triggered his PTSD (another expression of emotional trauma) is merely a response to my ""abuse."" I have a hard to explaining the double standard there, but I am pretty sure there is one.

Eventually the physical pain will subside and I will forget the way it feels to be hit with something I never once would have considered to be dangerous. 

Just a day later--when this recent wound is still tender, I am confident that the silent shame following me around is a far more effective tormentor than you ever were. 

The minimally displaced base fracture on my fifth metacarpal healed. 
The purple discoloration surrounding my left eye has returned to my normal skin tone. 
The laceration covering half of my forehead will likely leave a small scar to serve as a subtle reminder of how foolish I have been, but It too will soon be an afterthought. 

That being said, I know I will not forget the way my peers looked at me yesterday morning when I arrived at work. Because how do you respect a person when you learn these terrible things about the interworkings of their life? 

The humiliation I feel as I sit here and pretend its not there will be an intangible and unavoidable torture that will be with me forever. 

So no. 

I don't want to be a survivor. 
I don't want to be damaged. 
I dont need a ribbon, a month, or another god damn hashtag. 
I just want to be fucking normal again.

This agony reminds me of why words like secrets exist.

This will be the third time I have to show up at work again with evidence of your anger and addictions on my face.  

Barb Simpson said it best, it doesnt matter how you feel on the inside, its whats on the surface that counts. 

I am most disappointed because my office used to be a safe place where i was well liked. Unfortunately, the majority of my peers are judgemental and the rest have become too uncomfortable to look at me. 

Each time i arrived with an obvious injury, the distrust of my character grew. I dont think this was intentional--after all, even on the most primal level, weakness simply isnt tolerated in the game where survival is a prize only awarded to the fittest. 

There were several days that I stayed at work long past 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I was terrified to return back home. I didn't want to find my Q drunk, dead, or passed out.

Had i been asked outright back then by any potential friendly, i likely would have just broke down and asked for help, but I was neither approachable or vulnerable. 

When i arrived with a broken hand, i pretended it wasnt swollen. When i showed up with a laceration across my face i stood up in front of 75 people and gave a sound presentation that i am almost certain did not reach a single person--not really anyway. 

So, eleven months after the first incident, i arrived today  with a broken heart, one good eye, and one black eye. Nobody said a word, but i know they know. 

This agony reminded me of why words like secrets exist. It feels like i detailed every gruesome scream in a single email and forwarded it like a superstitious chain letter. 

Im naturally very private, thats easier still when my shame breeds silence and reinforces the idea that i am the local unsolved mystery and page 7 freak of the week. While secrets dont make friends, they do keep the local people and their quesrions at bay. 

When I wake up, I listen for movements before I open my eyes. It's a heavy weight on my chest these days and waking up to the the pain of existing is mildly better than every day that i could be dead in the god damn ground. 

You gave all the bad things better names which let me stay hidden for far too long from all the demons in disguise. Ive been coexisting with evil my whole life and i think ive caused my internal warning system to malfunction. Arrogantly, i thought i had escaped the daily abuse of my early years.

The familiar gossip that surrounds me now only revealed that im simply on a repeating loop fueled by the speculation of those peering down from their ivory towers of pretty boxes filled with ticky tacky. 

What i need to get off my chest is that I hate that i am broken, i hate that i am stupid, I hate that i feel like a mistake. 

I only have myself to blame and i know its cliche but i dont wanna be me anymore. 

So in the next week when you realize i'm gone, all you'll find is a note with two seemingly simple things no longer left to do.

I (F28) spent 4.5 years in a relationship (2014-2018) with a very very abusive man- made high risk and police priority lists for a long time. We have a child together (2017). I ended relationship in July 2018, finished court proceedings in 2019 with a 5-11 year sentence (yay for a victory with the justice system after many failed cases!!)  Been in therapy since 2016, still actively go twice a month, and take medications for my depression, anxiety, PTSD, and mixed-bipolar. 

I have had to ""terminate"" or ""love from a distance"" two friends (both F28) in the past year or two; both friendships were slowly degrading with time. Friend 1 is in a physically abusive relationship (partner forced two miscarriages before allowing her to successfully carry a third pregnancy to term); friend 2 *was* in an emotionally abusive relationship, but has since left and established serious toxic coping mechanisms, and the final straw was calling me a bad friend because i wouldn't give her any of my prescription narcotics (she is a recovered addict)... 

I tried countless times to be a good friend and be supportive. But i had to walk away from both. It felt as though I was triggered every time friend 1 was assaulted, because she'd come to my house when it wasn't safe there. She said i was a bad friend because i ""never make time to visit,"" the abusive household. Friend 2 has very very negative mindset, continued to tell me i had life handed to me (brought up things from when i was a teen that i don‚Äôt even remember, and i'm a single mother in nursing school; no one can do the work for me but me), always finding negatives in my healthy relationship, etc. And both repeatedly told me ""i changed,"" and ""not the person they know"" which i think was always the point, because that person i was allowed people to abuse her -- i began to feel like these friends were abusive in other ways. 

i guess i just want to know if i am justified in what i feel like is protecting my own peace that i have worked tirelessly to get? My life has made a drastic turn around since 2018, changes i never thought i was able to accomplish, and it is hard having ""friends"" tell me i am a bad friend for needing space and time away. Friend 1 is still involved in her relationship, we havent spoken in over a year; i don‚Äôt think i will ever rekindle the friendship, but i still battle with if i ""abandon"" her. There were also countless conversations about my needs as a friend in the dynamic of the friendships; cutting them off was the last resort.

And to add, i understand the dynamics of abuse and why people cant leave; i cycled for many years. i also hurt and lost a lot of people along the way, but i could never blame those people because for so long i did ""love"" my abuser more than them.

TLDR: survivor (28F) out of abusive relationship for 5 years; hard to be friends with friends who are still in abusive relationships/displaying toxic behaviors and no sign of change/wanting to change.",2023-04-29 14:16:53,2025-03-17 03:18:26,survivor

I was reading up on the recently passed Secure 2.0 Act for my job and came across something that I thought was interesting and worth sharing.

This may be something that could help someone in your life. 

The Act makes a provision for DV survivors to take money out of their retirement plans or IRA‚Äôs without incurring the normal 10% penalty on an early withdrawal.

The plan has to allow it but there really isn‚Äôt any reason a plan shouldn‚Äôt make this change.

All IRA‚Äôs are automatically included because they aren‚Äôt governed by plan documents but by federal legislation.

The only requirement is that the employee/participant has to self-certify that they are DV survivors. This also takes effect on Jan 1 2024 so it really only counts on distributions after 12/31/23.

Also, the guideline states that the allowed amount is ‚Äúup to the lesser of $10k indexed or 50% of the vested balance) within one year of incident‚Äù

It‚Äôs just something I‚Äôd like to make people aware of.

Thanks for reading!

And tonight I had this epiphany that I need to start with myself....

I need to write MY STORY and do photos of ME first.

I would like others' thought on both ideas ..

NOTE: I go to therapy weekly (in the past long term biweekly was a thing for 9+ months), I‚Äôve been seeing my therapist for 6 years. Rarely missing an appointment. I also do A.R.T therapy with my therapist. Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) ‚Äî an eye-movement therapy designed to decrease the emotional reactivity and distressing symptoms experienced following stressful or traumatic events.

Anyways, I left my DV situation (physical, mental, and emotional) in April of 2018- (which was for about 2.5 years) In January of 2019 I met my now husband. Married in mid 2020. Now we have one child together. 

In therapy, I work on processing through my trauma and trying to get back the person i once was before my trauma from the guy I was with. I know I will never be the same, but I can try to get her back the best I can. 

I have always struggled with letting my guard down with my husband. I only want my pets/therapist when I get into a depressive episode, flashback, panic attack or any type of intense feelings/thoughts/memories. Through therapy we discovered that this is because the intensity of my trauma and through my ART therapy I will let him back in. Even though in my head I know my husband is such a safe person and loving man. The trauma still lives within and I can‚Äôt let him in to help because it makes me feel vulnerable again. I try so hard to not feel vulnerable with him because of how vulnerable I was in my DV situation. 

I want my husband to see me vulnerable and to help me when I am. My therapist says it‚Äôs going to take more time. But I am just posting here in hopes someone has been through something similar and has some advice. Thank you for taking the time to read. Thank you a billion times more if you have some advice.",2023-04-05 16:19:57,2025-03-17 03:18:31,survivor

yipo21,DC Police are now mandated and trained to connect all domestic violence survivors they encounter with counselors by phone.,NathanBacaNews,33,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/yipo21/dc_police_are_now_mandated_and_trained_to_connect/," I'm the WUSA9 reporter on this story. Some of you may remember the December 2021 death of Sylvia Matthews. She was the DC woman who police say was stalked for 20 years and murdered by her stalker despite calling MPD multiple times in the weeks before, and day of, her murder. We highlighted that murder and pressed for changes. Now, it's happened.

DC Police and DC SAFE, the domestic violence counseling hotline, came to an agreement with training to back it up. When an MPD officer encounters a domestic violence survivor in the field, that officer must call the hotline at 844-443-5732 with the survivor present. The officer is to connect that survivor to a counselor so emergency help options are given over the phone, not just by business card.

I've witnessed how this helped domestic violence survivors first hand by interviewing people on both sides of that crucial phone call. On a personal note, I'm happy to have played some role in getting MPD and DC SAFE to work together more - and grateful to the Matthews family for their advocacy. I can try to answer any redditors questions.

Included in the packet was a mostly blank sheet of paper that is giving me the opportunity to make a victim impact statement.  (A quick slice of background information) My ‚Äúex?‚Äù Is currently incarcerated without bail for multiple attacks on myself and my property.

The problem?:
I am not over him.  If he wasn‚Äôt locked up, I would most likely be making the same mistake again and trying to work on things.  I am very much in the stage where I am disassociating from the event, thinking about what I did wrong, remembering all of the wonderful things about him and most of all missing him desperately.  
I don‚Äôt want to miss my chance to be heard but I also fear that writing certain things may negatively affect the outcome of his trial.  I put money on his books a few weeks ago and was told by someone from the organization that is helping me not to do that again because his lawyer will try to use that against me during trial.

I‚Äôm looking for some guidance/advice from those with experience on what to stray away from writing.  Or even that, being at this part of my recovery, it might be in my best interest to not write a victims impact statement.",2023-04-03 20:54:37,2025-03-17 03:18:37,survivor

After what I thought was a loving relationship quickly turned verbal abusive he construction put me down, accused me of cheating and other things. 

One evening one of our arguments got a little heated, then it stopped I thought that was the end of it but he tried ending my life. The next morning my mum came to get me (as we were living together) after about two weeks of apologies and gifts I went back to him. I know I shouldn't have but I loved him. We started off again like it did at the beginning until I started working, he'd constantly accuse me of cheating, always checked up on me, came in to my place of work to make sure I was working. If I came home late (I was made to walk home even at night) he'd accuse me of cheating. 

Finally one day I had enough and a few months before I was 21 I called my mum and we moved all my stuff out but not within him trying to manipulate me into staying. I ignored him and left but it didn't stop he would constantly turn up to were I was staying, send me gifts, he even invited himself to my 21st birthday meal. After Christmas I was finally fully free of him until one day I had a male friend over someone who gave me the confidence to leave him after being in a similar situation with his ex girlfriend. My ex turned up at the place I was staying and barged his way in and attacked my friend as he thought we were ""sleeping"" together which wasn't true I tried to stop him but I ended up getting thrown into a wall by my ex. The police were involved over the attack but at the time I didn't want to press charges because I was too shaken up. I don't know if my friend did but it was me who mainly got hurt in the process.

Now I am fully free of my ex, it has taken it's time but I am healing, I am married with a 3 year old. This year 2022 I went to the police and made a report about everything although it's a game of he said she said and have closed the case I feel better about telling someone what had happened.

y3il3o,DV survivor going through it again,Ita_Angel,6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/y3il3o/dv_survivor_going_through_it_again/,"I (27) grew up with domestic violence, the abuser being my father. I have undiagnosed anxiety and most likely PTSD. ( yes I‚Äôve attempted to get help but let‚Äôs say that experience was less than ideal , I‚Äôll try again soon I‚Äôm sure just traumatized at the moment ) but my father has relapsed and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Any advice? 

Here‚Äôs the back story:
My dad has been an alcoholic since I could remember. He was very abusive to my mom and I could never understand why. 
He would always go on these drunk rampages about stupid things like not locking the door or us dropping something on accident. 
I‚Äôve learned to not slam things or stomp my feet purely to make sure I couldn‚Äôt make him mad. I‚Äôve now adopted this into my normal life that I get a mini panic attack if someone starts yelling or if I heard someone slam something. 
Two years ago I finally had enough and couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I lived at home with my sick mom and my dad. He came home one night so drunk he blamed us for things I didn‚Äôt even understand - such as us talking bad about him with his brethren in his lodge, snooping through his things, and more. He use to be in the military and I‚Äôm 1000% sure he has undiagnosed PTSD and paranoia. 
I had had enough and told him to stop it and tell me what is wrong so I can help him. One thing lead to another and he threatened to kill us after trying to back me into a corner and hurt me. He‚Äôs never hit me ever until now. This wasn‚Äôt the first time he has threatened to kill us though but this time I was extremely afraid he would purely by his eyes. He took out his gun and everything. He left after that and went for a drive. I called my sister and told her what happened. I got my mom and we went to my room. I put a space heater and a few other things in front of my door just in case and told my mom to go to sleep. I didn‚Äôt sleep that night, I stayed up and waited till he got home. I researched everything I could for help.
I made a plan to grab anything important and leave while he slept.
He came home at 3am made sure we knew too by honking the horn to wake us and maybe even the neighbors up. Got in the house and slammed the door to his room shut. Shook the house.

My mom and I got our things and left with the dog to a family friends house for help in the morning. We called the cops and he was put in jail for 24 hours. We had 24 hours to get everything together and get out. Which we did. After our court hearing we asked the judge to not put him in jail only if he agreed to getting counseling  on anger management and vowing to stay sober. Judge gave it for 18 month requirement with monthly check in on alcohol.

Since then my sister, brother in law, nephew, and mom went back home with him because purely he was so much better and wasn‚Äôt drinking. We were all happy! 
I ended up moving to Texas with my husband. 


Now it‚Äôs 2022, it‚Äôs happening again. We noticed earlier in the year that he was starting to pick up drinking again. He‚Äôd come home late but never buzzed or drunk. He didn‚Äôt know we knew at the time (we track his location). Lately he‚Äôs been coming home buzzed and or drunk. His anger is back to how it was prior to us leaving before. He almost hurt my nephew (2 years old) while yelling about who chipped his mug and throwing it in the direction of the baby.
They live together so it‚Äôs a little harder this time to up and leave like before. I also live out of state so I can‚Äôt just fly up to help..

Since it‚Äôs started I can barely sleep or eat a whole meal. I think I‚Äôve eaten maybe a one whole meal in the last 4 days. 
All I want is my family to be safe and my dad to get the help he needs.. before he loses his whole family permanently this time.",2022-10-14 03:20:44,2025-03-17 03:18:44,survivor

My situation is really bizarre because it started out with mainly verbal abuse as a small child, but escalated to serious, brutal physical abuse when I was around 7-16. My dad abused both me and my mom, but my mom also abused me too. I used to fight back and whenever I did my parents would start recording me to have ‚Äúevidence‚Äù against me if I ever attempted to report them. When I was 16, my family packed up and moved a few hours away from where I grew up. After that, the physical abuse mainly stopped, just the occasional slap which, to me at the time, was nothing. My parents always told me that they stopped bc they realized they made mistakes, but they continued to manipulate me and verbally and emotionally abuse me until I moved out at 18. As I‚Äôve gotten older, I think they stopped physically abusing me because I was getting too old to keep quiet about why I constantly had cuts, burns, and bruises. 
Here is why I struggle calling myself a DV survivor: I still keep in contact with them. My family has always been well off and so when I was in college I maintained a relationship with them so they‚Äôd pay for my school. Now I keep in contact with them so they‚Äôll pay for my upcoming wedding. They‚Äôve given me a car, paid my rent for years while I was in school, and will undoubtedly offer me more if I attempt to cut them off and do it on my own as I have in the past. I feel immensely guilty because not only does this make me feel dirty and cheap for putting a price on my trauma, but I also feel ungrateful because this level of financial security at my age is such a massive privilege. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do about all of this. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs right to finally cut them off or if it‚Äôs just me being spoiled and ungrateful. What I do know is that I don‚Äôt feel like my story will have an end until I cut contact with them, so right now I struggle to call myself a DV survivor.",2022-08-30 22:55:07,2025-03-17 03:18:45,survivor

dbx1h2,Brain Injury in 81% of Reported DV Survivors,Concussion-GamePlan,29,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/dbx1h2/brain_injury_in_81_of_reported_dv_survivors/,"Domestic Violence Awareness Month and Brain Injury - Of the intimate partner violence (IPV) survivors who seek help, 81% of them have suffered a head injury and 83% have been strangled. Brain injury is intimately tied to abuse and violence. 


1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men will experience some form of physical violence from a partner, with even higher statistics in marginalized populations such as people of color and LGBTQ+ populations. Intimate partner violence is the cause for a large proportion of brain injuries. This includes traumatic brain injury (TBI) from whiplash and physical beatings as well as acquired brain injury (ABI) from strangulation and oxygen deprivation.  


Of those who are seen in the ER, 70% of IPV survivors will never be identified as such. (Hospital staff will either never identify or never address the violence in 70% of cases.) In addition, the invisible wounds of a brain injury are often overshadowed by more visible trauma like broken bones and bruises. This lack of identification of both IPV and TBI virtually eliminates the possibility of connecting these survivors with proper resources. 


Brain injuries are linked to highly increased rates of mood disorders such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. IPV survivors who suffer from brain injuries are at an even higher risk. We need to better highlight these brain injuries so that survivors seeking help can be properly identified and treated.

Knowing to look out for brain injury can improve the care survivors are given from hospital staff, police, and judges. Knowing memory loss and confusion are symptoms can prevent an outsider from assuming the survivor is lying. Knowing that personality disorders, aggression, and frontal lobe issues are symptoms can help explain why this survivor is not getting along well with shelter roommates, etc. Knowing executive function and planning issues are symptoms can help someone from assuming the survivor is purposefully avoiding court, etc when in reality they just honestly forgot. 


Concussion GamePlan works on the PINK Concussions IPV Task Force, which works to compile an international network of resources for these survivors. If you are in an abusive relationship, resources are available. Call 911 for immediate help, or 1-800-799-SAFE to reach a DV hotline. You can also text ‚ÄúSTART‚Äù to 741741 for any type of crisis.",2019-10-01 17:56:32,2025-03-17 03:18:49,survivor

Staff and the other residents act like I am lying about everything in my past, everything I am currently saying, etc, and keep intentionally giving me horrible advice and making promises they don't intend to keep, they (staff and residents) are making fun of me/my situation, they make fun of where I'm from, and they are hoping to sabotage anything good I have going for me.
Since I've left him almost 2 months ago now, I've been told that I dont even qualify as DV anymore, yet I feel I never got the healing and help I needed to begin with!!
I have no family, a friend back home but they can't help. I'm beside myself and massively depressed. What do I do??",2025-03-17 02:39:43,2025-03-17 15:15:04,help
